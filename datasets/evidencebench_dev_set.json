            "Objective: Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a plasticizer used in medical products made with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic and may be toxic to humans.",
            "DEHP is lipophilic and binds non-covalently to PVC, allowing it to leach from these products.",
            "Medical devices containing DEHP are used extensively in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).",
            "Among neonates in NICUs, we studied exposure to DEHP-containing medical devices in relation to urinary levels of mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), a metabolite of DEHP.",
            "Design: We used a cross-sectional design for this study.",
            "Participants: We studied 54 neonates admitted to either of two level III hospital NICUs for at least 3 days between 1 March and 30 April 2003.",
            "Measurements: A priori, we classified the infants\u2019 exposures to DEHP based on medical products used: The low-DEHP exposure group included infants receiving primarily bottle and/or gavage feedings; the medium exposure group included infants receiving enteral feedings, intravenous hyperalimentation, and/or nasal continuous positive airway pressure; and the high exposure group included infants receiving umbilical vessel catheterization, endotracheal intubation, intravenous hyperalimentation, and indwelling gavage tube.",
            "We measured MEHP in the infants\u2019 urine using automated solid-phase extraction/isotope dilution/high-performance liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry.",
            "Results: Urinary MEHP levels increased monotonically with DEHP exposure.",
            "For the low-, medium-, and high-DEHP exposure groups, median (interquartile range) MEHP levels were 4 (18), 28 (58), and 86 ng/mL (150), respectively (p = 0.004).",
            "After adjustment for institution and sex, urinary MEHP levels among infants in the high exposure group were 5.1 times those among infants in the low exposure group (p = 0.03).",
            "Conclusion: Intensive use of DEHP-containing medical devices in NICU infants results in higher exposure to DEHP as reflected by elevated urinary levels of MEHP.",
            "Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is an aromatic diester used primarily to soften and plasticize the rigid polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC); DEHP may represent between 20 and 40% of the finished weight of the plastic.",
            "Among other properties, DEHP imparts to PVC flexibility, strength, optical clarity, and resistance to broad-range temperature variations.",
            "In its pure form, DEHP is a clear, oily liquid, which is highly lipophilic (fat soluble) and poorly soluble in water.",
            "In PVC plastic, DEHP resides in the PVC matrix as a semisolid and readily migrates out of the plastic into blood or other lipid-containing solutions in contact with the plastic, a phenomenon observed with blood stored in PVC bags.",
            "Because of its versatile properties, DEHP is also found in many commercial and household products such as vinyl floor and wall coverings, furniture, raincoats, and shower curtains, as well as cosmetics, personal care products, and food packaging.",
            "DEHP has been used as a plasticizer in a variety of medical products, such as bags containing blood, plasma, intravenous fluids, and total parenteral nutrition, tubing associated with their administration, nasogastric tubes, enteral feeding tubes, umbilical catheters, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuit tubing, hemodialysis tubing, respiratory masks, endotracheal tubes, and examination gloves.",
            "The rate of DEHP leaching varies not only with the type of solution in contact with the plastic material but also with storage and temperatures at the time of use, storage time, and percent DEHP in the plastic product.",
            "The leaching rate of DEHP has been studied most rigorously for banked blood and plasma and, as reported, varies between 0.25 to 0.40 mg/100 mL/day for whole blood stored > 21 days at 4\u00b0C and 6 mg/unit of platelet concentrate stored at room temperature.",
            "Leaching has also been demonstrated in a study in which endotracheal tubes were found to have 6\u201312% less (0.06\u20130.12 mg DEHP/mg tube) DEHP after use.",
            "Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), one of the metabolites of DEHP, consistently produces developmental, reproductive, and hepatic toxicity in laboratory animals, raising concern about whether human exposure to DEHP approaches the levels of adverse effect found in toxicologic studies.",
            "Medical devices containing DEHP are in extensive use in modern neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).",
            "It has been estimated that such use might be exposing infants to DEHP at levels that exceed the average daily adult exposure [median = 0.71 \u03bcg/kg body weight/day ] by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude, approaching the lowest observed adverse effect level in animal studies (38\u2013144 mg/kg body weight/day).",
            "A recent study showed that MEHP urinary concentrations in neonates undergoing intensive therapeutic interventions in a NICU were several times higher than those from the general U.S. population.",
            "In addition to potentially high neonatal exposure in NICUs from DEHP-containing products, there is additional concern regarding potential health risks because, until 3 months of age, infants have immature glucuronidation pathways.",
            "Because glucuronidation, via enzymes such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, facilitates urinary excretion of phthalates and other xenobiotics, a reduced potential for glucuronidation may lead to slower MEHP excretion and higher levels of MEHP in neonates than in older children and adults.",
            "Among neonates in NICUs, we conducted a study to characterize DEHP exposure and to quantitatively relate the use of DEHP-containing products to urinary levels of MEHP, a biologic marker of DEHP exposure.",
            "Materials and Methods",
            "Study population.",
            "We studied a convenience sample of 54 infants enrolled from the level III NICUs at two major Boston-area hospitals.",
            "Level III NICUs provide all newborn care, including mechanical ventilation, high-frequency ventilation, surgery, and cardiac catheterization.",
            "We selected infants to reflect a range of diagnoses (including congenital anomalies and developmental and metabolic abnormalities) and NICU care requirements (including ventilation, enteral feedings, parenteral nutrition, and indwelling catheterization).",
            "Infants must have been in the NICU at least 3 consecutive days before enrollment, have had a corrected gestational age of \u226444 weeks, and have been born at or transferred to either hospital between 1 March and 30 April 2003.",
            "Concerns regarding the sensitivity of this research led to the design and implementation of a data and sample collection protocol that was based on visual inspection and that did not include inspection of the medical records.",
            "The study protocol and methods were approved by the institutional review boards of Harvard School of Public Health, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital.",
            "Assessment of DEHP exposure.",
            "Before data collection, we defined three DEHP exposure categories (low, medium, and high) based on a review of medical products typically used in both NICUs and information provided by their manufacturers with respect to DEHP content.",
            "Infants classified as having low DEHP exposure were those receiving primarily bottle and/or gavage feedings.",
            "The medium-DEHP exposure group included infants receiving enteral feedings by indwelling gavage tubes either continuously or by bolus feedings; intravenous hyperalimentation by indwelling percutaneous intravenous central catheter (PICC) line, broviac, or umbilical vessel catheter (UVC); and/or nasal continuous positive airway pressure by nasal prongs.",
            "The high-DEHP exposure group included infants receiving continuous indwelling UVC, endotracheal intubation, intravenous hyper-alimentation by the central venous route (i.e., PICC line, broviac, UVC), and an indwelling gavage tube (for gastric decompression).",
            "One of the study investigators (R.G.) observed the care of each infant for 1\u20134 hr per day for 1\u20133 days per infant, for a total of 3\u201312 hr of observation per infant.",
            "Observations were made during a single day for 37 infants, on 2 days for 12 infants, and on 3 days for 5 infants.",
            "During the observations, the investigator took an inventory of products in use for the care of each infant.",
            "This information was used to categorize infants into low-, medium-, and high-DEHP exposure groups.",
            "None of the infants changed DEHP exposure groups over the course of observation.",
            "Assessment of urinary MEHP.",
            "The observing investigator collected spot urine samples at the end of each infant\u2019s observation period(s).",
            "A total of 81 urine samples were collected from 54 infants.",
            "Two or more urine samples came from 17 infants, and of these, four samples were collected concurrently with the first samples, and 18 others were collected 6\u201372 hr after the first samples.",
            "We used these repeated samples to assess intraindividual variability in urinary MEHP levels.",
            "Urine samples were collected by either squeezing the urine from a cotton gauze placed in the infant\u2019s diaper at the beginning of the observation period or from the cotton filling of the diaper the infant wore during the period of observation.",
            "The cotton gauze or the removed cotton diaper filling was placed into a 3\u20135 cc polypropylene syringe (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), the plunger was replaced, and the urine was squeezed into a 2- or 4-cc Nunc (Rochester, NY) cryovial.",
            "Urine samples were frozen within 4\u20136 hr at \u201335\u00b0C and shipped on dry ice to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA) for analysis.",
            "Urine specimens were analyzed for 10 phthalate monoesters, including three DEHP metabolites [MEHP, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate], using automated solid-phase extraction/isotope dilution/high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry at the CDC.",
            "Monobutyl phthalate and monobenzyl phthalate were also frequently detected.",
            "In this report, we focus on levels of MEHP, because this metabolite has been most studied and is a valid biomarker of DEHP exposure.",
            "The analytical method used for measuring phthalate metabolites in urine has been described in detail previously.",
            "Briefly, the method involved the enzymatic deconjugation of the phthalate metabolites from their glucuronidated form, followed by automated solid-phase extraction.",
            "We used reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to separate the phthalate metabolites from other components in the extracted urine.",
            "We then quantified the metabolites by isotope dilution/tandem mass spectrometry.",
            "Samples, reagent blanks, and quality control (QC) materials were processed identically.",
            "QC materials were analyzed along with the study samples to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.",
            "QC materials with low concentrations (QCL) and high concentrations (QCH) were prepared from a base urine pool, obtained from multiple anonymous donors as described previously, dispensed in 5-mL aliquots, and stored at \u201320\u00b0C.",
            "Each QC material was characterized by repeated measurements, spanned over several weeks, to define the mean concentrations and the 95% and 99% control limits of MEHP.",
            "Each analytical run consisted of 50 (5 QCs, 5 blanks, and 40 unknown) samples.",
            "The concentrations of the replicate QCH and QCL materials, averaged to obtain one measurement of QCH and QCL for each run, were evaluated using standard statistical probability rules.",
            "All MEHP concentrations, reported in nanograms per milliliter of urine, were blank-corrected.",
            "However, MEHP is not typically found in the reagent blank samples, and when it is, it is at concentrations near the limit of detection (LOD; 0.87 ng/mL).",
            "Specimens with MEHP levels below the LOD were assigned a value of 0.435 ng/mL, the midpoint between 0 and the LOD.",
            "Assessment of other variables.",
            "We collected data, as available, on gestational age and length of stay in the NICU.",
            "However, data on these variables were incomplete for about half of the infants because, as noted, the sample collection was anonymous and not based on review of medical records.",
            "The interpretation of these data is likely to be tenuous because of missing data, and we therefore do not present these results.",
            "Statistical analysis.",
            "We used Fisher\u2019s exact test to evaluate differences in sex and institution by DEHP exposure group.",
            "To evaluate the intraindividual variability of urinary MEHP levels, we computed Spearman correlations between repeated urine specimens.",
            "For unadjusted comparisons of urinary MEHP levels by sex, institution, and DEHP exposure group, we used the Mann-Whitney Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test.",
            "We used multiple linear regression to compare urinary MEHP levels across DEHP exposure groups, adjusting for institution and infants\u2019 sex.",
            "Because the distribution of urinary MEHP was skewed, we used log-transformed MEHP values in the regression models.",
            "In regression models of log-transformed MEHP, the regression parameters estimated MEHP levels in the medium- and high-DEHP exposure groups as a proportion of MEHP levels in the low-DEHP exposure group.",
            "Our primary analyses focused on the MEHP levels in the first urine specimen collected from each infant; in secondary analyses, we incorporated first and, where available, second and third specimens, using repeated-measures regression to compare MEHP levels across exposure groups.",
            "We used quantile regression to estimate sex- and institution-adjusted quartiles of urinary MEHP for each DEHP exposure group.",
            "Results",
            "The 54 infants in our study were roughly equally distributed between the two institutions, and 34 (63%) were female (Table 1).",
            "Thirteen (24%) infants had low exposure to DEHP-containing products, 24 (44%) had medium exposure, and 17 (32%) had high exposure.",
            "Among the first set of urine samples collected from these infants, 11 (20%) had MEHP levels that were less than the LOD (0.87 ng/mL), and the maximum level was 758 ng/mL (geometric mean = 14 ng/mL; geometric SD = 8.6 ng/mL).",
            "Correlation between urinary MEHP levels in repeated urine samples.",
            "Among the 17 infants with multiple urine samples, urinary MEHP measurements from the same infants were highly correlated.",
            "Spearman correlations were 0.9 (p < 0.0001; n = 17) for urinary MEHP levels in the first and second urine specimens, 0.9 (p = 0.04; n = 5) for the second and third specimens, and 0.7 (p = 0.2; n = 5) for the first and third specimens.",
            "Although our data were limited, we observed no apparent dissimilarity in the correlation between specimens collected at the same time (correlation coefficient r = 0.80; n = 4) versus those collected at different times (r = 0.88; n = 13 first and second samples only).",
            "Correlates of DEHP exposure group and urinary MEHP.",
            "Compared with infants in the two lowest DEHP exposure groups, infants in the high-DEHP exposure group were more likely to be patients at institution B (Table 1).",
            "In unadjusted comparisons, urinary MEHP levels were significantly higher among infants at institution B (Mann-Whitney Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.002; Table 2).",
            "Association of DEHP exposure group with urinary MEHP.",
            "Progressively higher DEHP exposure group was associated with progressively higher urinary MEHP levels.",
            "Median urinary MEHP levels (and 25th and 75th percentiles) in infants in the low-, medium-, and high-DEHP exposure groups were 4 (< LOD, 18), 28 (3, 61), and 86 (21, 171) ng/mL, respectively.",
            "DEHP exposure group remained a substantial predictor of urinary MEHP levels even after adjusting for infants\u2019 sex and institution of hospitalization (p = 0.09; Table 3, Figure 1).",
            "Compared with infants in the low-DEHP exposure group, infants in the medium-DEHP exposure group had urinary MEHP levels that were twice as high [95% confidence interval (CI) of the multiplication factor, 0.5\u20137.4; p = 0.3], and infants in the high-DEHP exposure group had levels that were 5.1 times as high (95% CI of the multiplication factor, 1.2\u201321.9; p = 0.03).",
            "These results were identical when we analyzed all first, second, and third urinary MEHP values together using repeated-measures regression.",
            "Urinary creatinine levels were available for 67 samples, 45 infants in total.",
            "Using this restricted sample, we analyzed the association between DEHP exposure group and creatinine-adjusted urinary MEHP concentrations, and the results were nearly identical to the results from the analyses of unadjusted MEHP levels.",
            "Discussion",
            "Our study of 54 infants receiving care in two NICUs demonstrated that the use of DEHP-containing medical devices is associated with a monotonic increase in urinary levels of MEHP, a metabolite of DEHP.",
            "In particular, urinary MEHP levels among infants in the high-DEHP exposure group were five times as high as those in the low-DEHP exposure group, after adjustment for infants\u2019 sex and institution of care.",
            "Urinary MEHP levels among infants in the medium-DEHP exposure group were twice as high as levels among infants in the low-DEHP exposure group.",
            "Adjustment for institution resulted in modest attenuation in the association between DEHP exposure group and urinary MEHP, which may reflect the potential influence of other unmeasured sources of DEHP exposure that differed between institutions.",
            "In addition, urinary MEHP levels were modestly higher among male infants.",
            "Although the length of observation varied across infants, because of the acuteness of care requirements and the indwelling (and therefore continuous) nature of many of the products used, potential DEHP exposure from medical devices in use was stable over each infant\u2019s observation period(s).",
            "To date, there are limited measurements on human neonatal exposures to phthalates and, to our knowledge, no data on whether such exposures are associated with adverse health effects in these neonates.",
            "Limited data describe the effects of neonatal exposures on health later in life.",
            "A study of 18 adolescents 14\u201316 years of age who had undergone ECMO as neonates found no apparent abnormalities in their growth and pubertal maturity, and the levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone (in boys), and estradiol (in girls) were within the normal reference ranges for stage of pubertal development.",
            "It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from this study, because it was very small, and normal reference ranges for reproductive hormones, physical growth, and sexual maturation are quite wide.",
            "Furthermore, the postnatal levels of DEHP or its metabolites at the time of the ECMO treatment were not known.",
            "Our study is limited by the narrow range of descriptive data available on the infants and the small number of infants examined.",
            "Yet it is the first study to directly examine the relative use of DEHP-containing medical products among NICU infants in relation to urinary MEHP concentration.",
            "Because our study included infants with a range of diagnoses and NICU care requirements, the results of this research may be generalizable to infants of other level III NICUs.",
            "Several studies have considered DEHP exposure or sources of DEHP exposure in NICU infants.",
            "considered exposure to DEHP from medical procedures in six newborn infants of a university hospital NICU undergoing intravenous infusion for more than 2 weeks.",
            "The geometric mean level of MEHP (100 ng/mL) in 33 urine samples collected from these children was several times higher than that from the general U.S. population \u22656 years of age (geometric mean, 3.43 ng/mL).",
            "The urinary MEHP levels reported in that study were similar to those in the high-DEHP exposure group in our study.",
            "studied 19 toddlers 12\u201317 months of age in Imperial County, California.",
            "Twelve children provided two urine samples, and seven children provided a single sample.",
            "Eight urine samples from six children had detectable levels of MEHP.",
            "The mean urinary MEHP level was 4.6 ng/mL (SD, 6.4 ng/mL; range, LOD < 1.2 to 47.3).",
            "These levels were an order of magnitude lower than the mean in the present study on neonates.",
            "Others have directly assessed sources of DEHP exposure from medical devices among infants.",
            "Among neonates, found that DEHP leached from ECMO circuit tubing at 10.5\u201334.9 mg/kg, depending on length, type, and size of PVC tubing.",
            "Interestingly, circuits with heparin coating did not leach DEHP.",
            "directly observed the degradation of 44 indwelling PVC endotracheal tubes that had been used in NICU infants for as little as 12 hr.",
            "These tubes demonstrated a substantial loss of DEHP, 0.06\u20130.12 mg DEHP per mg of sample (6\u201312%), compared with unused tubes.",
            "In our study, DEHP exposure differed significantly by institution.",
            "Specifically, most high-DEHP-exposure infants were from institution B, and infants from institution B had a greater median urinary MEHP concentration than did infants from institution A. studied DEHP leaching from parenteral nutrition infusion lines used for 24-hr fat emulsion administration in 2-kg neonates and found that 25 mL of standard 20% lipid emulsion administered by pump via polyethylene syringes and PVC infusion line yielded samples (after 24 hr at 27\u00b0C) having postinfusion DEHP concentrations of 422.8 \u03bcg/mL.",
            "The authors concluded that the total amount of DEHP for a 2-kg baby caused by lipid emulsions in a day, under these conditions, is approximately 10.2 mg.",
            "In our study, we speculate that the higher exposure to DEHP in institution B compared with institution A reflects the extensive use in particular of two DEHP-containing items at institution B: unsiliconized PVC indwelling endotracheal tubes, and a PVC indwelling hemodynamic monitoring UVC used for, among other things, parenteral nutrition.",
            "These DEHP-containing medical devices were sparingly used in institution A.",
            "In conclusion, our study demonstrated an association between the use of DEHP-containing medical products and urinary levels of MEHP in NICU infants.",
            "This study was designed to evaluate the distribution of exposure to DEHP among NICU neonates only.",
            "Additional studies, larger and more comprehensive than the present one, with follow-up of the infants, are needed.",

            "For the experiment now described, the apparatus was adjusted to take one puff of 25 ml vol and 2 sec duration regularly once every min into a chamber containing 100 ml air and to hold the 1 in 5 smoke air mixture in the chamber for a period of 15 sec.",
            "Rats were fitted snugly into Perspex tubes such that their noses protruded into a smoke chamber.",

            "The unsmoked butt after 11 puffs averaged 20 mm.",
            "After the experiment had been in progress for about a year, the question arose whether rats were able to hold their breath throughout the 15 sec of the cycle during which the smoke/air mixture was offered to them and thereby avoid exposure to smoke.",
            "Simple observation suggested that some animals stopped breathing for at least a short time when smoke came into the chamber.",
            "To overcome doubts on this score, after a number of preliminary tests it wNas decided to introduce exposure to CO2 into the exposure regimen.",
            "For 5 min before the start of each smoke exposure session, rats were given only a 950 air: 500 CO2 mixture to breathe.",
            "During smoke exposure a mixture of the same composition was offered to rats instead of air during the 45 sec of the cycle when no smoke was in the chamber.",
            "(The atmosphere in which the cigarette burnt down was, of course, air and not the air: CO2 mixture.)",
            "In the preliminary tests involving 20 rats, it wras found that rats would tolerate ex- posure to smoke and to CO2 in the wNay described and that inclusion of CO2 in the exposure regimen increased the mean carb- oxyhaemoglobin levels after exposure to the smoke from one cigarette (8-45% \u00b1 1-00% standard error (s.e.) compared with 3-9000 +0440o s.e.).",
            "Tn another experiment, further evidence of improved breathing with CO2 stimulation w\"as obtained using cigarettes impregnated with 74As (as arsenious sulphate).",
            "Although not an ideal particulate phase marker (since small amounts of radioactive arsine were detected in the vapour phase), the use of 74As did give an indication of total smoke inhaled and retained by exposed rats.",
            "The respective mean amounts of radioactivity recovered from the lungs of 10 CO2 stimulated and 10 non-stimulated animals were 17.45% + 1-71% and 846% \u00b1 1-24% s.e. of the mean total radioactivity transferred to the exposure chamber.",
            "These means were significantly different at the P < 0 001 level.",

            "They found that in 20 rats each exposed to the smoke from one labelled cigarette without CO2 stimulation an average of 2-2% \u00b1 0-70% s.e. of the mainstream particulate matter was deposited in the head and an average of 7-000 \u00b11.5% in the larynx, trachea and lungs.",

            "Greater deposition of smoke particulate matter in the lungs than in the head has also been seen in recent experiments (P. J. Simons, unpublished) in wN,hich rats were exposed to various dilutions of smoke in an apparatus similar to the Harrogate Smoker.",

            "It was also of interest to examine how time of death in relation to the start of treatment influenced the incidence and severity of GBM, CCM and Sq.M and to see whether there were interrelationships between these lesions.",
            "For this, attention was restricted to those animals exposed to smoke (i.e. Group 1), and a second \" blind\" examination w%as carried out by a second pathologist (F.J.C.R.).",
            "In the case of CRD the 2 pathologists used different criteria: B.R.D. classified terminal bronchopneumonia as CRD Grade 3 Xwhereas F.J.C.R. either regarded such rats as ungradable or assessed the severity of CRD on the basis of appear- ances in lung lobes or lobules not involved in the bronchopneumonic process.",

            "Pathological changes occurring in the lungs were of 2 kinds; those seen in approximately the same incidence in all groups (e.g. CRD) and those seen fre- quently in smoke exposed rats but only uncommonly or never in rats of other groups (e.g. GBM, CCM and Sq.M).",

            "However, the incidence of squamous neoplasms only was not significantly greater in Group 1 than in the control groups.",
            "One rat of Group 2 (2 mg BP in I + CB and no further treatment) had, when it died, a squamous carcinoma of the lung extending beyond the lobe of origin, but the incidence of Sq.M in this group was lower, but not significantly so, than that in untreated rats.",
            "Of 83 rats given 2 mg BP in 1 + CB once, followed by smoke exposure (Group 3), 3 developed squamous carcinomata and a further 5 had grade 1 or grade 2 Sq.M.",
            "If one assumes that the squamous lesions designated as grades 0-6 constitute a, natural biological series and that the numerical designations of grades reflect their relative severity i.e. that 1 rat with a grade 6 lesion is equivalent to 6 rats with grade 1 lesions), then the 2 groups exposed to tobacco smoke (Groups 1 and 3) do not differ significantly from each other, but together have a mean grade that is signi- ficantly higher than that in the non smoke exposed Groups 2, 4 and 5 (P < 0.001).",
            "It is noteworthy that, if attention is restricted to Sq.N, then 7 out of 489 smoke exposed rats had this lesion compared with only 1 out of 274 rats that were not exposed to smoke.",
            "These proportions do not differ statistically.",
            "Surprisingly, there was no evidence of any trend of increasing incidence of Sq.N with age so that for this lesion, unlike the others, standardization for age of death, did not make any real difference.",
            "In fact, of the 7 Sq.N observed in the 2 smoke exposed groups, 6 occurred in the 341 animals dying in the first 90 weeks of the experi- ment and only 1 in the 146 animals dying subsequently.",
            "Incidence of pulmonary adenomata",
            "Six pulmonary adenomata were observed, 4 in 489 smoke exposed rats and 2 in 274 rats in the other groups.",

            "Rats in the two groups exposed to tobacco smoke (Groups 1 and 3) developed significantly fewer mammary tumours than rats in the other groups (P < 0.001).",
            "In this respect, sham exposed rats were similar to untreated animals.",
            "One hundred and forty-eight rats developed one or more mammary tumours.",
            "Most of the tumours were benign fibro- adenomata or adenomata with or without evidence of secretory activity.",
            "Some benign intraduct papillomata were also encountered.",
            "Only 10 rats had mammary tumours which were regarded as malignant, i.e. adenocarcinomata.",
            "The numbers of rats that had malignant mammary tumours in relation to the number ex- amined postmortem were Group 1- 2/406, Group 2-2177, Group 3-0183, Group 4 2/96 and Group 5-4/101.",
            "The lower incidence in Groups 1 and 3 is partly attributable to the poorer survival of rats in these groups.",
            "After correction for survival, none of the observed values differed significantly from the expected ones.",
            "Two other differences significant at theP < 0 05 level were an excess (O= 9, E = 4.8) of chromophobe adenomata of the pituitary gland in the sham exposed group and a deficiency (O= 8, E = 16.9) of neoplasms of lymphoreticular tissues in the rats exposed only to tobacco smoke.",
            "Since 40 comparisons of \" observed \" and \" expected \" were made in this analysis (a groups X 8 sites), it is not surprising that results significant at this level were throw-n up occasionally.",
            "Insofar as the deficiency of lymphoreticular neoplasms in Group 1 was not matched by a similar deficiency in the group given BP in I + CB before smoke exposure (Group 3), and the excess of pituitary tumours seen in sham exposed rats (Group 5) was not matched by any excess incidence in the 2 smoke exposed groups, it would be advisable to regard these differences as of doubtful significance unless confirmed by further work.",

            "The results of the \" blind \" examina- tion of lung slides from rats of Group 1 is shown in Table IV.",
            "The mean grade for GBM rose rapidly after 10 weeks, GBM lesions being seen in almost all rats dying after 19 weeks.",
            "The last rat to die with no GBM lesion was at week 34.",
            "By 40 weeks, the mean grade had reached about 2 and only increased slowly thereafter.",
            "After week 101 every animal had a GBM grade of 2 or higher.",
            "The mean CCM grade rose in a fairly continuous manner throughout the experi- ment.",
            "More than half of the rats dying during each 10-week period from 50 weeks onwards showed CCM and after 70 weeks more than 90% of rats had CCM lesions.",
            "Sq.M was uncommon until about week 70, only about 1 rat in 20 that died before this time having the lesion.",
            "After that the rate jumped to 20% and remained that or more until the end of the experiment.",
            "One rat died after only 26 weeks with a grade 4 squamous lesion.",
            "Since it had no CCM and a GBM score of only 0 5, it seems unlikely that this lesion was caused by treatment.",
            "Between the 60-69 and 70-79 week death groups the proportion of rats dying with CCM jumped from 66-7 to 95.8% and of rats dying with Sq.M from 5-6 to 29*1%.",
            "One naturally wonders whether the introduction of exposure to carbon dioxide during week 69 (see p. 472) was in any way responsible for these jumps in incidence.",
            "or GBM than expected for all rats dying at that week.",
            "For each rat with Sq.M, the differences between its 0CM and GBM grades and the average grades of rats dying with Sq.M = 0 during that time period were calculated.",
            "These differences were summed over all time periods and the results displayed in Table V.",
            "There was highly significant evidence that rats with Sq.M grades 1, 2 or 3 had a greater CCM than expected.",
            "The 4 rats with squamous tumours had less CCM than expected but this was possibly an artefact caused by difficulty of determining CCM in the presence of a tumour.",
            "There was also significant evidence for rats with Sq.M having a higher GBM than expected but this difference was not so marked.",
            "It was clearest for rats with Sq.M _ 1.",
            "This could be explained to some degree by the fact that this relation- ship was more marked in rats dying early when Sq.M values were low.",
            "Later on all rats had high GBM so the relationship tended to disappear.",
            "Secondly, one wished to see whether 0CM was interrelated with GBM inde- pendently of time.",
            "The method used was similar to that for Sq.M, except that instead of computing differences in CCM or GBM of rats with Sq.M > 0 compared with rats with Sq.M = 0, we computed differences in GBM of rats from the average GBM for that week and summed by 0CM.",
            "The results displayed in Table VI indicate that there is a significant excess in GBM grade above expected as CCM increases.",
            "CCM and GBM Interrelationships between the 3 types of lesion",
            "In order to consider the interrelationships between the 3 types of lesions, it was clearly necessary to standardize for the time of death.",

            "There were 3 possibilities within any pair and the action taken was as follows: (1)",
            "If one rat scored higher than its matched pair on both conditions, score I to the +ve group;",
            "(2) If one rat scored higher than its matched pair on one condition and lower on the other, score 1 to the ve group;",
            "(3) If the 2 rats scored equally on either condition ignore the pair.",
            "By comparing the total numbers of +ve and -ve the null hypothesis that the 2 conditions were independent could be tested.",
            "Under this hypothesis the +ve should equal the -ve and a chi-square test was used to evaluate the significance of any difference between the numbers of +ve and -ve found.",
            "The results of this analysis are dis- played in Table VII and it can be seen that, though there was a tendency for a rat with higher CRD to have more CCM or Sq.M, this was not statistically significant.",
            "One section of lung from 2 smoke exposed and one sham exposed rats that died during each 10-week period of the experiment up to 130 weeks and one section from 2 smoke exposed and one sham exposed rats that died between 130 and 160 weeks, were stained with (a) haematoxylin and eosin (H. and E.), (b) Perl's reagent for ferrous iron, (c) periodic acid-Schiff reagent (PAS) for mucopoly- saccharides, and (d) Schmorl's reagent for lipofuscin.",

            "DISCUSSION",
            "The incidence of pulmonary neoplasms was not significantly increased in the 408 rats exposed to the smoke from 10 ciga- rettes per week from the age of 10 weeks.",
            "Premature death may have reduced the chances of animals living long enough to develop pulmonary neoplasms.",
            "Nevertheless, 103 rats survived for 100 weeks or longer and this was sufficient for a positive effect to be seen if smoke in the doses received by the animals had been more than weakly carcinogenic for rat lung.",
            "Dose of smoke 1.00 2 13",
            "It is arguable that a significant incidence of pulmonary neoplasms might have been seen if animals had been Not Not significant significant exposed to more smoke.",
            "Theoretically this might be achieved t in GBMl in 3 ways: (i) by increasing the number of to determine the days per week on which rats were exposed ment in GBM was to smoke from 5 to 7; (ii) by increasing the s : number of cigarettes rats were exposed to on each day; (iii) by introducing prior and concomitant exposure to carbon dioxide into the exposure regimen from the start of the experiment.",
            "Preliminary experiments with the Har- rogate Smoker that lasted a few weeks suggested that rats might tolerate exposure to the smoke of 3 or even 4 ciga- rettes during an 8 h day.",
            "However, our experience in the present experiment suggests that exposure even to only 2 cigarettes during 8 h each day reduced survival as compared with sham exposed rats (see Table I).",
            "Exposure to more than 2 cigarettes per 8 h day is likely therefore to have reduced survival further.",
            "On the other hand, it might be possible to increase daily exposure to smoke without increasing the death rate by extending the period of each day during which rats are exposed.",
            "Also, a 7 day per week exposure schedule apart from increasing the total weekly dose of smoke might in practice be associated with better survival.",
            "Deaths were most apt to occur on resumption of smoking exposure on Mondays after the 2 days break at weekends in the present experiment.",
            "Effective exposure of the lungs of rats to smoke during the first 69 weeks of the experiment would almost certainly have been increased by incorporating carbon dioxide into the exposure regimen.",
            "How- ever, if this had been done at the start of the experiment, when the animals were small and unused to smoke, more early deaths might have occurred.",
            "Clearly there is a need for more experience and information on these aspects of the techniques for exposing rats to smoke.",
            "Pathological changes associated with expo- sure to smoke",
            "The most interesting findings in the present experiment were the statistically significant associations between exposure to smoke, the occurrence of GBM lesions and the increased incidence and severity of 2 kinds of metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium, CCM and Sq.M (Table II andIV).",
            "In the light of the reported effects of inhalation exposure to smoke in other species, none of these findings was particularly surprising.",
            "On the other hand, as far as we know, the interrelationships between the various changes have not previously been investigated quantitatively.",
            "Other 8tudies in rats",
            "As mentioned in the introductory paragraphs, Mori (1964) saw squamous metaplasia in the lungs of rats exposed to smoke.",
            "He also remarked on the presence of \" carbon particles\" and of foci of \"hyperplasia of alveolar cells '.",
            "It is possible that Mori's \"carbon particles were the GBM seen by us and that the alveolar hyperplasia he saw was the same lesion as that referred to as CCM in the present report.",
            "Mellors (1958), referring to the results of exposing rats to cigarette smoke, wrote \" After cigarette smoke exposure . . . alveolar septa phagocytes increase in number, some enter the alveolar spaces, and all become laden with fluorescent smoke products\".",
            "Studies in other species Mahrburg (1958) and Otto (1963) described what were probably GBM and CCM lesions in mice exposed to cigarette smoke.",
            "Otto (1963) like Essenberg (1952), Essenberg, Horowitz and Gaffney (1955)  and Muhlbock (1955) before him, also saw an excess of pulmonary adenomata in mice in response to smoke exposure.",
            "We did not see a comparable excess of adeno- matous neoplasms in rats exposed to smoke.",
            "Otto (1963) reported the occur- rence of 2 squamous carcinomata in mice exposed to tobacco smoke.",
            "The results reported by us in rats would appear to be as equivocal as Otto's in respect of the induction of this kind of neoplasm of the lung by smoke.",
            "Dontenwill (1970) and Dontenwill et al. (1973) reported the occurrence of papillo- mata, carcinomata and precancerous changes in the laryngeal epithelium of hamsters exposed to smoke.",
            "Changes in the lungs were less prominent but included \" macrophages with brownish epithelial inclusions \" and \" adenomatoid lesions \".",
            "Dontenwill also saw brown macrophages in untreated hamsters and hamsters exposed only to the vapour phase of smoke and this led him to conclude they should not be called \"smoke cells \".",
            "On the other hand, he saw a much higher incidence of both brown macrophages and adenomatoid lesions in smoke exposed hamsters than in untreated hamsters or in hamsters given other treatments without smoke.",
            "The larynxes of our smoke exposed rats appeared normal on macroscopic exami- nation and, apart from slight epithelial hyperplasia and slight inflammatory in- filtration of the sub-epithelial tissues, no pathological changes were seen in any of the animals from which sections of the larynx were prepared.",
            "Auerbach et al. (1970) and Hammond  et al. (1970) reported the occurrence of invasive and non-invasive bronchioloalveolar tumours in the lung parenchyma of 34 out of 86 dogs exposed to smoke via a tracheostomy.",

            "McCarthy, Gibbons and Reed (1964) however, found that the endotracheal introduction of mucin led to the development of Perl- positive brown-pigmented alveolar macro- phages and suggested plasma transferrin as the source of the iron.",

            "The precise nature of CCM may be debated.",
            "Because of the tendency for the change to occur in alveoli close to the terminal bronchioles or arising out of the respiratory bronchioles, the change has been referred to by some workers as \" bronchiolization \" and thought of as a downward growth of bronchiolar epithe- lium into the affected alveoli.",
            "Electron microscopic studies have shown that, in at least some instances, the appearances of CCM are accounted for by an overgrowth in Type II alveolar lining cells at the expense of Type I cells.",
            "The fact that in rats in the present experiment CCM was sometimes located at points at some distance from terminal bronchioles (e.g. in alveoli just under the pleura) and the observation that metaplastic epithelium was sometimes ciliated and sometimes not, suggest that CCM should not be regarded as a single entity.",
            "As can be seen in the photomicrographs, the appearance of CCM can closely resemble that of a well differentiated adenoma.",
            "It is possible that CCM in rats as a result of treatment with tobacco smoke may be the pathological equivalent of the bronchiolo-alveolar tumours seen by Auerbach et al. (1970) in smoke exposed dogs.",
            "Significance of squamous metaplacsia of alveolar epithelium (Sq.M)",
            "For many tissue sites in the body, a metaplastic change from columnar to squamous, although reversible, is regarded generally by pathologists as a step in the direction of cancer.",
            "Thus, squamous mnetaplasia in the uterine cervix or bron- chial epithelium is regarded as suspicious in this context.",
            "Auerbach et al. (1967Auerbach et al. ( , 1970) ) reported the occurrence of Sq.M in the epithelium of the bronchi of smoke exposed dogs.",
            "A curious feature of the experiment reported in the present paper was the almost complete absence of Sq.M in the epithe- lium of the main airways.",
            "Instead, the metaplastic changes of this kind were confined to the alveoli.",
            "One may specu- late as to whether the difference in location is attributable to the rat as a species or to the method of exposure.",
            "A feature of the lesion in the lungs of the rats in the experiments described in the present paper is that most of the squamous neoplasms themselves consisted of well differentiated squamous tissue without cellular atypia or irregularity.",
            "It is perhaps not sur- prising therefore that metaplastic lesions showing cellular atypia were not seen.",
            "CONCLUSIONS",
            "The experiments described show that, with the occasional administration of tetracycline, it is possible to expose rats over long periods to cigarette smoke without serious interference by sponta- neous respiratory disease.",
            "They also show that if rats are exposed to sufficient smoke for long enough then 2 kinds of lesion, viz.",
            "aggregates of pigment laden macrophages and columnar or cuboidal metaplasia of alveolar epithelium, are found in virtually every rat at death.",
            "In addition, lesions of a third kind, namely, squamous metaplasia of alveolar epithelium, are found in some 30-40% of smoke exposed rats.",
            "The 2 kinds of metaplastic lesion may be useful as indices of biological activity.",
            "However, differences between rats in breathing patterns are associated with differences in amounts of smoke taken into the lungs.",
            "Several technical diffi- culties would therefore have to be over- come, particularly in relation to dosi- metry, before a rat inhalation model could be used reliably for bioassay pur- poses.",
            "The importance of this is under- lined by the observation (Davis et al.,  1975b) that the incidence of both types of metaplasia in rats exposed to smoke condensate or fractions of condensate by intratracheal instillation is associated strongly with the physical mass of the material instilled, and only to a lesser extent with the relative tumorigenicity for mouse skin of the material instilled.",

            "Environmental exposures can have adverse effects on a woman\u2019s reproductive health.",
            "Female firefighters have a variety of environmental and occupational exposures that can negatively impact their reproductive health by increasing their risk of miscarriage and pre-term birth, as well as increasing their use of fertility drugs.",
            "Anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) is secreted by the granulosa cells of follicles and plays a role in follicular development.",

            "After this, as a woman ages, her AMH steadily declines to mirror the decline in number of oocytes.",
            "AMH is used as a clinical marker of ovarian reserve and is often used as a marker of responsiveness to fertility treatment.",
            "However, AMH is a novel biological marker, so few studies have measured AMH on a population level.",
            "AMH may be useful in measuring the effects of exposures that target the ovary, and reduction in AMH levels have been associated with inhaled environmental exposures including smoking, burning fuel indoors for cooking or heating, and the indoor spraying of pesticides for malaria control, and may be useful in measuring the effect of exposures that target the ovary.",
            "Prior research in mice has shown that benzo[a]pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and PM2.5 exposure were associated with decreased AMH.",

            "Firefighters are exposed to a number of occupational hazards that can poorly impact their health.",
            "Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether AMH levels were lower in female firefighters compared to civilian non-firefighting women and to investigate whether among female firefighters, there was a dose-dependent relationship between years of firefighting and AMH levels.",
            "2. Materials and Methods",
            "2.1. Study Design and Recruitment",
            "Firefighter participants were primarily recruited from The Health and Wellness of Women Firefighters Study (HWWFS), an ongoing cohort study of female firefighters over the age of 18 in the United States and Canada.",
            "The purpose of the HWWFS is to investigate the work environment, health, and perceived experiences of women firefighters in the fire service.",
            "The HWWFS recruited initial participants through multiple affinity group email lists that have been previously used, as well as snowball sampling, which allows current participants to recruit additional participants.",
            "In addition, a small number of firefighters expressed interest in participating in our study after learning about it through an occupational health conference on women in the fire service and were invited to participate.",
            "Firefighters were asked to recruit one or more friends or relatives to serve as the comparison group.",
            "Participants received a USD 5 gift card incentive for their participation.",
            "All protocols and communications with research participants were pre-approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Arizona (Protocol #2007816290, Approved 29 June 2020).",
            "All participants were asked to respond to an online survey regarding their occupational and health history.",
            "Women were excluded from the analyses if they had a history of chemotherapy or radiation, were current cigarette smokers, or had an oophorectomy (Figure 1; n = 19), as these have been shown to affect AMH levels.",
            "We also excluded participants (n = 81) who did not provide a dried blood spot sample, had missing information on firefighting status, and one duplicate response.",
            "Lastly, we excluded participants who did not supply enough blood for measurement (n = 13).",
            "Participants with history of certain autoimmune diseases (polyglandular syndrome, lymphocytic oophoritis, Addison\u2019s disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, or Celiac disease) were also excluded (n = 3) as these conditions can diminish ovarian reserve.",
            "2.2. Measures",
            "2.2.1. Exposure",
            "The primary exposure of interest was history of firefighting based on self-report.",
            "Among current and past firefighters, we also investigated occupational exposures.",
            "Years in the fire service and the number of live fires responded to in a typical month were treated as continuous variables.",
            "Poor fit of personal protective equipment (PPE) was a binary variable defined as a Likert Scale Score less than 3 on a scale of 1 = \u201cDoes not fit\u201d to 5 = \u201cFits very well\u201d for any PPE category (Firefighting turnout coat/pants; Firefighting boots; Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA); Firefighting helmet; Firefighting hood (standard); Firefighting hood (vapor); Firefighting gloves; Work gloves; Eye/face protection other than SCBA face piece).",

            "The collection of the DBS required the participants to prick their fingers using lancets and provide five DBS for measurement.",
            "After collection, the dried blood spots were returned to the University of Arizona and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until all samples were collected.",
            "Once all samples were collected, they were sent to Ansh Labs/Motive Biosciences Inc. (Webster, TX, USA) to assay AMH using the picoAMH ELISA.",
            "Motive Biosciences reported a coefficient of variation of 9.4\u20139.5% for this analysis.",
            "Participants were given the option to receive the results of their AMH assay.",
            "AMH (ng/mL) was log-transformed for all analyses to account for its non-normal distribution.",
            "Log-transformed AMH (ng/mL) was analyzed as a continuous variable.",
            "AMH values below the limit of detection (LOD) (0.03 ng/mL) were recoded as 0.03/sqrt(2).",
            "AMH values above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) (>17.3 ng/mL) were recoded as 17.3 ng/mL.",

            "Information on other reproductive conditions was also collected, such as endometriosis (Yes, laparoscopically confirmed; Yes, not laparoscopically confirmed; No), history of hormonal contraceptive use (ever and current), and current contraceptive method (Surgery (sterilization), birth control pill (oral contraceptives), male condom, other hormonal methods (implant, injectable, contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring), intrauterine device (IUD), periodic abstinence, other, none of the above).",
            "Hormonal contraceptive use was analyzed categorically (birth control pill; other hormonal methods; or neither).",
            "Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on self-reported height and weight and converted to kg/m2.",
            "BMI was reported as a continuous variable and categorized (BMI < 18.5; 18.5 \u2264 BMI < 25; 25 \u2264 BMI < 30; BMI \u2265 30).",
            "History of other autoimmune diseases was self-reported as a categorical variable.",
            "Perceived stress was measured using the 10 Question Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), with a higher score indicating a higher perceived stress level.",
            "Participants also reported the number of known pregnancies they have had, including both miscarriages and births, as well as the number of biological children they have.",
            "Two participants reported having 14 biological children despite only having four pregnancies, so we chose to omit these two responses from the number of biological children.",
            "2.3. Statistical Methods",
            "T-tests were performed using the Satterthwaite method to produce p-values for continuous variables in in Table 1 and Chi-Squared tests were performed for categorical variables.",
            "Frequencies < 5 were suppressed in Table 1 and Table 2 to ensure participant privacy.",
            "Linear regression models were utilized to estimate the association between firefighting status, firefighting exposures, and continuous, log transformed AMH.",
            "All models were adjusted for age and age2, to account for a non-linear association between age and AMH, and BMI.",
            "These confounding factors were determined based on a priori associations in the published literature.",
            "Percent changes in AMH between exposure groups were calculated from the estimated regression coefficients (\u03b2) as ([exp(\u03b2) \u2212 1] \u00d7100) and presented with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (Table 3).",
            "We also investigated effect modification by age, by stratifying results by age group (<32, 32\u201337, and 38+) and conducted likelihood ratio tests comparing a model with an interaction term between age categories and exposure and a model without.",
            "We restricted our analyses to non-smokers, as lowered AMH has been associated with smoking.",
            "As women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are known to have higher age-standardized AMH levels, in sensitivity analyses we excluded participants with probable PCOS (n = 20), defined as either having self-reported PCOS and/or an AMH value above 10 ng/mL.",
            "3. Results",
            "We included 106 firefighters and 58 non-firefighters in our main analysis (Figure 1).",
            "Firefighters and non-firefighters had mean ages of 38 and 35 years, respectively (p-value: 0.02) (Table 1).",
            "In total, 44.8% of firefighters had a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m2 and 15.2% had a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2, while 26.3% of non-firefighters had a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m2 and 19.3% had a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2.",
            "Firefighters indicated a higher level of perceived stress compared to non-firefighters (p-value: 0.04).",
            "Firefighters reported having fewer pregnancies and biological children than non-firefighters; however, these findings were not statistically significantly different.",
            "Participants were overwhelmingly white (95.7%), which is congruent with demographics of past studies on this population and the fire service in general.",
            "More firefighters reported very strenuous exercise habits than non-firefighters, while more non-firefighters reported sedentary habits (p-value: 0.001).",
            "Our findings suggest that a larger proportion of firefighters reported an early age at menarche (age < 13), history of infertility, and PCOS than non-firefighters; however, these results were not statistically significantly different between groups.",
            "Among participants who were firefighters, most were currently working in that occupation at the time of the study (91.5%) (Table 2).",
            "The average length of years in the fire service was 13.3, ranging from 2 to 34 years, and the average number of calls responded to in a typical month was 62, with 2 of those calls being live fires.",
            "Within the fire service, participants mainly worked as firefighters, drivers, or operators with the next most common ranks being firefighter/paramedic and company officer (Lieutenant/Captain).",
            "Over a third of firefighters participated in wildland firefighting, either part-time or full-time.",
            "Over half of firefighters reported poor overall fit of at least part of their PPE, with approximately one quarter of firefighters reporting poor fit of their SCBA.",
            "Overall, firefighters had a lower mean AMH compared to non-firefighters in crude models and this association remained statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounding factors (\u221233.4%\u2206 (95% CI: \u221255.0, \u22121.4)) (Table 3).",
            "Results from sensitivity analyses excluding participants with probable PCOS generally supported the primary analysis (Table S1).",
            "For analyses investigating occupational factors among firefighters, we observed a 54.6% lower AMH for every 5 years worked in the fire service (95% CI: \u221263.4, \u221243.7) (Table 4).",
            "However, this attenuated after adjustment for potential confounding factors, age, and BMI (0.70%\u2206; 95% CI: \u221225.11, 35.43).",
            "We observed no change in AMH for number of live fires responded to in a typical month, for poor fit of at least one form of the PPE, for poor fit of their SCBA, or for wildland firefighting.",
            "We observed similar patterns in sensitivity analyses excluding participants with diagnosed or suspected PCOS (Table S2).",
            "Results stratified by age group showed that firefighters 38 years or older had a 63.5% lower AMH than non-firefighters in that age group (95% CI: \u221283.8, \u221217.9) (Table S3).",
            "However, there was no statistically significant difference in firefighter status and AMH between age groups (interaction p-value = 0.71) (Table S3).",
            "4. Discussion",
            "Women firefighters may be at greater risk for adverse reproductive outcomes compared to a civilian population; however, there has been limited research on this topic.",
            "We observed that female firefighters had lower levels of AMH compared to civilian women, a marker of ovarian reserve and reproductive function.",
            "These findings, along with prior research, suggest that more research on the reproductive health and fertility of female firefighters is warranted.",
            "In our main analyses, we observed that firefighters had a 33% lower mean AMH level compared to non-firefighters after adjustment for confounders.",
            "These findings support evidence from previous studies that examined the effect of other environmental exposures on AMH levels.",
            "A prior cross-sectional analysis found that current smokers had a 44% lower AMH (95% CI: \u221268, \u22122) compared with never smokers.",
            "In a 2016 analysis of the Sister Study, women who smoked 20 cigarettes per day had lower AMH compared to non-smokers (\u221256%, 95% CI: \u221280, \u22123).",
            "Given these and other findings on the association between smoking and time of menopause, we restricted our analyses to non-smokers.",
            "The Sister Study also observed that women who reported burning wood indoors had a 36% lower AMH (95% CI: \u221256, \u22128) compared to those who did not; and women who reported indoor use of artificial fire logs had a 46% lower AMH (95% CI: \u221267, \u221210).",
            "In an analysis of AMH levels of South African women, researchers found that women exposed to pyrethroids from indoor pesticide spraying for malaria control had a 25% lower AMH (95% CI: \u221239, \u22128) than those who were not exposed.",
            "Given the potentially large clinical magnitude, the similarity with other findings, and the large uncertainty in the estimated effects, our results should be replicated using larger sample sizes.",
            "We examined the relationship between AMH and continuous years in the fire service among firefighters to determine if there is an inverse dose\u2013response relationship between number of years in the fire service and AMH levels.",
            "We hypothesized that women who have been firefighters longer would have had more exposure to inhaled environmental exposures, decreasing their AMH.",
            "When we examined this relationship, we observed a statistically significant decrease in AMH for every five years of service, but this attenuated after adjusting for age and BMI.",
            "This is most likely driven by the high correlation between years in the fire service and age.",
            "We observed no association between number of live fires in a typical month, poor fit of PPE, poor fit of SCBA, or wildland firefighting and AMH levels.",
            "We had hypothesized that we would observe a decrease in AMH among firefighters who reported poor fit of the PPE and SCBA, because of the possibility for increased exposure to inhalants.",
            "Over half of firefighters reported poor fit of at least one item of their PPE, and almost a quarter of firefighters reported poor fit of their SCBA.",
            "Previous research demonstrated that both male and females reported poor fit of their gear, but female firefighters may be more likely to select larger sized gear to better compensate for fit in the bust and hip, and these larger uniforms may lead to injury.",
            "Further research is needed on the association between fit of PPE and AMH among female firefighters.",
            "The large confidence intervals presented are indicative of the small sample size, further supporting the need for research on this population with a larger sample size to allow for increased precision.",
            "In addition to environmental exposures, there may be other exposures related to firefighting that may influence AMH levels.",
            "Prior research has found that psychological stress was negatively associated with serum AMH in infertile women.",
            "Firefighters are subject to repeated exposure to trauma and higher risk of depression than the general population.",
            "Future studies should examine the relationship between stress and AMH, as well as other occupational factors, such as shift work.",
            "Future studies investigating stress may also be enhanced by measuring stress hormones.",
            "Inhalation and dermal exposure to smoke and PAH may reduce AMH, but the potential mechanism by which firefighting influences AMH is not fully understood.",
            "The mechanism likely involves multiple pathways that target follicular development possibly related to smoke inhalation and stress.",
            "More research is needed to investigate the pathway between firefighting and reduced AMH.",
            "This study has many strengths including its novel focus on occupational exposures among female firefighters and the utilization of AMH as a biological marker on a population level.",
            "To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to use this biomarker in occupational health research.",
            "However, there are important limitations that must be recognized.",
            "One of the biggest limitations of this study is its comparatively small sample size.",
            "Future studies should focus on recruiting firefighters at a local and national level via social media to increase participation, as recruiting through social media has previously been successful, and special attention should be paid to recruiting a representative comparison population.",
            "Participants from this study were recruited from a number of sources but women who are interested in contributing to reproductive health research because of their own adverse experiences may have been more likely to contribute.",
            "Additionally, there may be measurement error of AMH levels due to sample collection which involved participants collecting their own samples at home and returning in the mail, Prior research has suggested that AMH collected via DBS is stable across the menstrual cycle and up to two weeks at room temperature; however, degradation and other unknown factors may have affected the quality of the biomarkers.",
            "For example, there was variation in time outside of the storage freezer across samples and some samples were sent to us without the required desiccant packet, which was added before storage.",
            "We would expect any misclassification of AMH to be nondifferential with respect to the exposure.",
            "In addition, all measures except AMH were self-reported, so their accuracy should be taken into consideration.",
            "However, we would expect that our primary exposure, history of working as a firefighter, will have been recalled accurately.",
            "Future studies should also differentiate between volunteer and career firefighters, as their level of exposures may differ and affect their risk of reproductive health outcomes.",
            "Additionally, we did not collect detailed occupational information from non-firefighter participants.",
            "It is possible that occupational status of non-firefighters may also influence their AMH levels.",
            "However, we would expect this to attenuate any observed associations.",
            "Future studies should collect detailed information on occupation.",
            "There may be other covariates, such as diet and exercise which may serve as potential confounders.",
            "However, there is limited and conflicting existing literature on whether diet or physical activity influence AMH levels among the general population.",
            "We collected information on history of infertility and utilization of fertility treatments, but we did not collect information on what influenced participants to pursue fertility treatment or not.",
            "There are many factors a person may consider when deciding whether or not to utilize fertility treatments including financial, health status, and lifestyle.",
            "Given our small sample size, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions about the differences in reported infertility and utilization of fertility treatments in our study population.",
            "Future studies should collect more information about fertility treatments.",
            "Lastly, we removed participants with autoimmune conditions that are known to influence AMH, but some conditions may be undiagnosed.",
            "However, we would expect the influence to be minimal and the prevalence of undiagnosed individuals to be similar between groups.",
            "5. Conclusions",
            "There is increasing interest into the reproductive health of female firefighters.",
            "Our results suggest that there may be an association between exposures related to working as a firefighter and a biological marker of reproductive health, AMH.",
            "Future research should include a larger sample of female firefighters and non-firefighters as well as longitudinal analysis to further investigate these findings."

            "The work process was as follows: The workers sprayed cobalt blue dye on bare plates (round, diameter 15-25 cm) and later removed superfluous dye from parts of the plate in order to form a picture in white and various blue colors.",
            "In both factories, an exhaust cupboard was built into the workplace of each worker.",

            "The amount of paint used did not exceed 3 g a person per day.",

            "It is not known whether the cobalt-aluminate spinel dye can penetrate the skin.",
            "Another study indicated that surface contamination might be a possible source of oral exposure (1 1).",
            "This may have been an alternative route of exposure, especially before 1982 when the plates were held in one hand during the spraying process.",
            "The forearm became almost as blue as the plates.",
            "Throughout the century there was a cloakroom and a canteen for the workers, who were not allowed to smoke or drink coffee at the workplace.",
            "These rules were, however, frequently violated.",
            "All the workers were doing the same tasks with the same tools but personal habits, including productivity, may have caused different exposure levels (11).",

            "A woman with employment periods in both the exposed and the unexposed (to cobalt) departments would be classified according to the first exposed employment period, and a woman with employment in both factory 1 and factory 2 was classified according to the first of these.",

            "For factory 2, no statistics were available for comparison.",
            "Therefore, we checked the completeness of the files indirectly by comparing the observed number of deaths in the cohort with the expected number based on mortality rates for all Danish women.",
            "The overall mortality for all three groups corresponded well with the expected (table 2), and the cohort data were therefore unlikely to have an unbalanced deficit of registrations.",
            "During the follow-up period, 127 cancer cases were diagnosed in the cohort (table 3).",
            "The overall cancer incidence was slightly elevated among the exposed women (observed 67, expected 55.80, SIR 1.20, 95% CI 0.94-1.52), and close to unity in the reference group (observed 60, expected 60.62).",

            ".",
            "In the 1960s breweries in Canada, Belgium, and the United States added cobalt acetate(II), cobalt(I1) chloride or cobalt sulfate to beer to reduce the foam, and occasionally deaths were observed from this cobalt exposure in heavy drinkers.",
            "Up to 50% of the deceased heavy beer drinkers died from doses much lower (up to 1.5 pg . ml-I beer) than the doses of cobalt(I1) chloride hexahydrate used for treating anemia (oral doses of 20-300 mg a day).",
            "It may thus be important to be specific about the chemical structure of the cobalt and confounding exposures.",
            "One implication of the change in factory 1 from cobalt-aluminate spinel to cobalt silicate in 1972 is therefore that the measurements of air and urine excretion are Table 4.",

            "Eight days after administration, 56% of the absorbed cobalt had been eliminated via the urine and 1 1 % via the feces.",

            "This may explain the high number of emigrated workers.",
            "It is comtnon that personnel files are selected in such a way that the records for persons known to be permanently ill are not included in new versions of the register, or they are even removed from existing files (20).",

            "None of the lung cancer cases had worked with this new dye only.",

        "paper_as_candidate_pool": [
            "Background",
            "An increasing number of studies have shown that several ubiquitous environmental contaminants possess thyroid hormone\u2013disrupting capacities.",
            "Prenatal exposure to some of them, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), has also been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in infants.",
            "Objectives",
            "In this study we examined the relationship between exposure to potential thyroid hormone\u2013disrupting toxicants and thyroid hormone status in pregnant Inuit women from Nunavik and their infants within the first year of life.",
            "Methods",
            "We measured thyroid hormone parameters [thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), total triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)] and concentrations of several contaminants [PCB-153, hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (HO-PCBs), pentachlorophenol (PCP) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB)] in maternal plasma at delivery (n = 120), in umbilical cord plasma (n = 95), and in infant plasma at 7 months postpartum (n = 130).",
            "Results",
            "In pregnant women, we found a positive association between HO-PCBs and T3 concentrations (\u03b2 = 0.57, p = 0.02).",
            "In umbilical cord blood, PCB-153 concentrations were negatively associated with TBG levels (\u03b2 = \u22120.26, p = 0.01).",
            "In a subsample analysis, a negative relationship was also found between maternal PCP levels and cord fT4 concentrations in neonates (\u03b2 = \u22120.59, p = 0.02).",
            "No association was observed between contaminants and thyroid hormones at 7 months of age.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Overall, there is little evidence that the environmental contaminants analyzed in this study affect thyroid hormone status in Inuit mothers and their infants.",
            "The possibility that PCP may decrease thyroxine levels in neonates requires further investigation.",
            "Tyroid hormones (TH) play several essential roles for brain maturation in humans.",
            "Adequate levels are necessary at specific times in certain regions of the brain for the normal development of the nervous system during fetal and neonatal periods.",
            "Maternal TH are the only source of TH for the developing brain of the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy, at the end of which the fetal hypothalamic\u2013pituitary system initiates its own TH synthesis and secretion.",
            "Studies have demonstrated that maternal TH can regulate gene expression in the fetal cortex, but their action on the developing brain remains unclear.",
            "Any alteration of maternal and/or fetal TH availability during critical periods of TH-dependent action may have a detrimental impact on the developing fetal brain, as previously demonstrated in animal and human studies.",
            "Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a group of persistent and lipophilic organochlorine compounds (OCs), has been associated with neurodevelopmental deficits in childhood in most cohort studies focusing on developmental neurotoxicity of PCBs.",
            "Animals studies have reported detrimental effects of in utero exposure to PCBs on cognitive and motor functions as well as on the auditory system.",
            "At the biochemical level, several PCB congeners disrupt the thyroid function, principally by lowering plasma thyroxine (T4) and greatly depressing T4 concentrations in brain tissue in rats exposed prenatally.",
            "Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) has been used as a fungicide and is also a by-product of the manufacturing of chlorinated solvents and metallurgical processes.",
            "HCB is found worldwide because of its long-range atmospheric transport, is very persistent, and tends to accumulate in adipose tissues.",
            "Exposure to HCB in rats can produce several effects including reduced T4 plasma levels and hypothyroidism.",
            "HCB has been shown to interfere with T4 uptake into the cerebrospinal fluid in rats.",
            "Transport of T4 across the blood\u2013brain barrier by transthyretin (TTR) is one mechanism by which TH reaches the developing fetal brain and also facilitates maternal transfer across the placenta.",
            "Some chlorinated phenolic compounds (CPC) such as the hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (HO-PCBs) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) possess a greater in vitro binding affinity for TTR than the natural ligand T4. Furthermore, HO-PCBs and PCP can strongly inhibit TH sulfation, which along with desulfation appear to be very important pathways regulating circulating TH concentrations in the fetus.",
            "Results from epidemiologic studies among pregnant women are scarce, but suggest potential effects of OCs on thyroid economy.",
            "In contrast, assessments of the relation between environmental contaminants and the thyroid status of newborns have resulted in equivocal findings, possibly because of differences in the biological matrices for exposure determination (blood, plasma, placenta, or breast milk), the contaminants measured, and the congener grouping as well as the timing of postnatal TH dosage.",
            "With regard to CPCs, only two studies have investigated their effects in newborns and found opposite results.",
            "Because the potential effects of thyroid-disrupting contaminants on maternal and neonatal thyroid status are not yet clear, we undertook a study to determine the relationship of background exposure to OCs and CPCs with TH status in pregnant women and their infants within the first year of the infant\u2019s life.",
            "This study addresses this research question among the Inuit population of Nunavik because these communities are among the most heavily exposed to these contaminants on earth, mainly through sea mammal consumption.",

            "All pregnant Inuit women from the three largest communities of the Hudson Bay coast of Nunavik were invited to participate in a study that aimed to document the effects of prenatal exposure to environmental contaminants on infant development.",
            "From November 1995 to March 2001, a research assistant contacted each potential participant after her first prenatal visit with a midwife or a nurse.",
            "All pregnant women gave informed consent for themselves and for their infants before participating in the study.",
            "The study protocol was approved by the Nunavik Nutrition and Health Committee and by ethics committees at Laval University (Qu\u00e9bec City, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada) and Wayne State University (Detroit, Michigan).",
            "One prenatal and two postnatal (at 1 and 6 months) interviews were conducted to obtain sociodemographic and personal information from the mothers.",
            "The participation rate for this study was 69%.",
            "Among the 248 participating mother\u2013infant dyads, 17.8% were excluded due to the adoption of the newborn, fetal or postnatal mortality, and loss to follow-up.",
            "Biological data on TH and OC concentrations were available for 204 pregnant women.",
            "Because TH levels slowly return to non-pregnancy levels after delivery and to ensure that measured levels of TH were not related to postpartum thyroid dysfunction, which occurs between 2 and 12 months postpartum, mothers from whom the blood sample was drawn 31 days after delivery were excluded from the statistical analysis (n = 71).",
            "Pregnant women who declared using medication for thyroid diseases were also excluded (n = 4).",
            "Biological data on TH and OC concentrations were available for 108 infants at birth and 175 infants at 7 months of age.",
            "Neonates born prematurely and/or with low birth weight were also excluded because transient neonatal hypothyroxinemia may be induced by prematurity (< 37 weeks gestation, n = 6) and low birth weight (< 2,500 g, n = 1).",

            "Plasma samples were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until time of analysis.",

            "Overall, the results show that plasma concentration of OCs and CPCs were not significant predictors of TSH and TH concentrations in this population of pregnant women and their offspring.",
            "However, maternal levels of PCP were negatively associated with fT4 concen- trations in umbilical cord blood of neonates, suggesting that this compound may reduce the transfer of maternal T4 across the placenta to the developing fetus.",
            "As reported in most studies [reviewed by ], an association between PCB-153 and TH concentrations was not found in Inuit neonates at birth.",
            "Similarly, no association was seen in these infants at the 7-months follow-up.",
            "Also, these data did not corroborate the relationship between PCB congeners and TSH or TH levels seen in the CHAMACOS (Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas) study, in any of the exposure matrices (maternal, cord, or infant plasma).",
            "ese associations were observed even though the maternal PCB-153 concentrations were almost 20 times lower than those in the present study.",
            "Difference in the profile of other PCB congeners in that population may provide one explanation for the discrepancy in results between the CHAMACOS study and the present study.",
            "Another possible important difference between both populations is the iodine intake.",
            "Indeed, iodine, which is essential for thyroid function, is found in high concentration in some seafood products.",
            "erefore, exposure to iodine and OCs co-occurs in individuals such as the Nunavik Inuit, who consume a large amount of marine products.",
            "Therefore, not taking into account urinary iodine concentrations in epidemiologic studies aiming to investigate this research question may partly explain the inconsistent results.",
            "The absence of an association between HCB and umbilical cord fT4 concentrations in this study are not consistent with a previous finding of significant positive associations in another sample of Inuit neonates and in newborns from the Lower North Shore of the St. Lawrence River.",
            "The lower statistical power of the present study as well as a difference in adjustment of confounders may account for the differential results.",
            "However, the absence of relationship between HCB and fT4 found in the present study are in agreement with two other epidemiologic studies among neonates.",
            "The absence of an association between PCB-153 and thyroid parameters in pregnant Inuit women was similar to that reported in the second Faroe Islands cohort.",
            "However, two other epidemiologic studies among pregnant women found a significant negative association of PCBs with T3 and/or tT4 status whereas, among Mexican-American pregnant women, three PCB congeners (44, 52, and 183) were negatively related to fT4 concentrations.",
            "It is possible that the effects observed in these three studies were mostly attributable to the exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, which are usually higher in urban settings than in isolated populations mostly exposed to environmental contaminants through fish and marine mammal consumption.",
            "As previously mentioned, high dietary iodine intake in fish-eating populations may also explain the lack of association between PCB-153 and thyroid hormone status in mothers.",

            "However, the authors were not able to determine whether effects on TH concentrations were related to PCBs or HCB plasma concentrations because these exposures were highly correlated.",
            "In the present study we also documented concentrations of HO-PCBs and PCP because several in vitro studies have revealed their potency in competitively inhibiting T4 binding to TTR.",
            "This T4-binding protein is implicated in the delivery of maternal T4 to the fetus across the placenta as well as the transport of T4 from blood into cerebrospinal fluid during brain maturation.",
            "However, experiments with TTR-null mice have shown that TTR is not essential for T4 distribution in brain.",
            "Nevertheless, as would be predicted from toxicologic data, a negative association was found between maternal PCP plasma concentrations and umbilical cord fT4 levels, but not with umbilical cord PCP, which has two times the binding affinity of the natural ligand T4 for TTR.",
            "Moreover, it was the predominant CPC in the Inuit population, and concentrations were mostly higher in umbilical cord plasma than in maternal plasma.",
            "Taken together, these findings seem to indicate that PCP may impede the transfer of maternal T4 to the fetus across the placental barrier to a certain extent by inhibiting maternal T4 binding to TTR.",
            "is mechanism may also have favored the transport of maternal PCP to the fetal circulation, which may explain the higher concentration of this compound in cord blood compared with maternal blood.",
            "The relation between maternal PCP and neonate fT4 concentrations was no longer evident at the later age, because there was no association between maternal or cord PCP and fT4 levels when the infants were 7 months of age (data not shown).",
            "The rapid maturation of the hypothalamus\u2013pituitary\u2013thyroid axis after the severing of the umbilical cord, which leads to the complete independence of the newborn from a maternal source of fT4, may explain such findings.",
            "However, these results should be interpreted with caution because no association was found with cord blood PCP concentrations even though they were highly correlated with maternal PCP levels (r = 0.85).",
            "Also, plasma",
            "Se concentrations of mothers and newborns included in the subsample analysis were lower than in the sample used for OCs (n = 80).",
            "Two other epidemiologic studies have looked at the association between CPC and TH concentrations in neonates.",
            "In another sample of Inuit newborns, found a negative correlation between the sum of PCP and 14 HO-PCBs with cord fT4, whereas reported a positive correlation between 6 HO-PCBs and neonatal blood-spot fT4 obtained on a filter paper.",
            "Other studies are needed to ascertain the potential effects of CPCs on neonatal TH concentrations, because the small sample size in the present study limits its conclusions.",
            "The increase of T3 with concentrations of HO-PCBs in pregnant women may be attributable to selective or combined inhibition of sulfotransferase and type I deiodinase (D1) activities, as these metabolites have been shown to competitively inhibit D1 and diiodothyronine sulfotransferases actions.",
            "Indeed, in adults, sulfotransferases irreversibly inactivate TH actions and facilitate D1 deiodination for complete degradation in the liver.",
            "Interestingly, in fetuses sulfated T4 and T3 are elevated compared with adult concentrations and have been proposed to serve as a reservoir of inactive TH for subsequent activation by sulfotransferases at specific developmental stages.",
            "is difference in TH metabolism between fetuses and adults, especially for sulfotransferase and deiodinase activities, may explain the absence of HO-PCB effects on cord T3 compared with maternal T3.",
            "These findings suggest that the synthesis or metabolism of transport proteins may be affected by environmental contaminants.",
            "Indeed, the negative association between PCB-153 and serum TBG concentration could by mediated by a diminution of TBG synthesis by the liver.",
            "Interestingly, we already reported a similar association in a population of neonates from the Lower North Shore of the St. Lawrence River.",
            "Because commercial fT4 immunoassays overestimate the fT4 levels at high TBG concentration and underestimate it at low TBG concentrations, these results may indicate that contaminants affecting TBG concentrations introduce bias in the assessment of the effects of thyroid toxicants on fT4 levels.",
            "Most toxicologic studies have focused on the competitive binding assessment of environmental contaminants with T4, without evaluating their ability to modify transport protein synthesis.",
            "Consequently, the results cannot be corroborated on biological mechanisms because toxicologic data are unavailable.",
            "Nevertheless, such an effect remains plausible.",
            "By analogy, have recently shown that polybrominated diphenyl ether congener 47 has the capacity to decrease TTR mRNA expression in the liver by an unidentified mechanism.",
            "An assessment of transport protein biosynthesis modification by environmental contaminants is needed to clarify this question.",
            "Conclusion",
            "In summary, in this study we did not find similar effects of potential thyroid toxicants on TH homeostasis in mother and infant.",
            "Differential TH and contaminant metabolizing capacity between fetuses and adults may account for this discrepancy.",
            "There were also no associations between concentrations of PCB-153 and TH levels in Nunavik Inuit mothers and infants.",
            "However, a significant inverse relationship was found between maternal PCP levels and fT4 umbilical cord concentrations.",
            "This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis regarding the capacity of CPCs to competitively inhibit T4 binding to TTR in humans.",
            "However, this result must be interpreted with caution because it was found in a subsample of the neonate population and consequently needs to be corroborated in larger studies.",
            "Nevertheless, epidemiologic studies of pregnant women suffering from hypothyroxinemia (low fT4) have shown that reduced transfer of maternal fT4 during fetal brain maturation can negatively affect the neurocognitive function in infants.",
            "Results from the neurodevelopment assessment of the participating infants in this cohort will allow us to determine whether a reduction of fT4 concentrations during fetal development, perhaps mediated by PCP, may induce deficits similar to those observed in the offspring of hypothyroxinemic pregnant women."

            "The neonatal developing brain is particularly sensitive to the effects of lead poisoning (5-7).",
            "Acute, high-dose lead administration in the neonate produces a classic clinicopathologic complex in human and experimental animals.",
            "Acute cerebral and cerebellar edema with hemorrhage are features of acute high-dose administration with the appropriate clinical manifestations of acute encephalo- pathy and seizures.",
            "The neuropathologic findings, while variable, are considered secondary to a proximate micro- vascular permeability change leading to red cell leakage, sub- acute endothelial proliferation, endothelial cell necrosis, microthrombosis, and perivascular periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)positive exudation (8)(9)(10)(11).",
            "While all the steps in the pathogenesis of acute Pb2+ encephalopathy are still unclear, a likely hypothesis is based upon the encephalopathy being secondary to a Pb2+induced vasculopathy.",
            "A direct toxic effect of Pb2+ on neu- rons is still equivocal.",
            "The cause of the apparent preferential sensitivity of the neonatal brain compared to adult is still unanswered but may be a reflection of the primitive, non- coupled development between the neonatal endothelial cell and astrocyte composing the blood-brain barrier, known to be developmentally immature during early brain development.",
            "In this hypothesis, it is proposed that the mature astro- cyte would provide a detoxification sink for removal of endothelial lead, thereby preventing excessive endothelial Pb2+ uptake, mitochondrial damage, and initiation of endo- thelial necrosis.",
            "The neuroclinical and pathologic changes associated with low-level, chronic lead exposure are well documented.",
            "There is a high incidence of irritability, hyperactivity, retardation of normal development, seizures, and psychomotor disturbance.",
            "Lead exposure is associated with hyperactivity, in turn a known risk factor for antisocial and aggressive behavior.",
            "Unfortunately, clear-cut neuropathologic findings associated with low-level lead exposure in humans are ill- described, and animal models have revealed confusing results.",
            "The neuropathologic changes, if true, have been detailed through morphometric analysis and have revealed alterations in dendritic arborization and density of synaptic complexes in the cerebral cortex (12,13), a decrease in hippo- campal pyramidal neuron spine density (14), reduction in dentate granule neuron dendritic field (15), decreased mossy fiber terminal proliferation in hippocampus (16,17), and abnor- mal dendritic branching of cerebellar Purkinje cells (18).",
            "In this latter study, the authors precluded the role of under- nutrition in contribufing to the dendritic abnormality and also demonstrated occurrence of these changes at blood levels insufficient to produce overt clinical toxicity.",
            "The described reduction in hippocampal development characterized by dysplasia in axonal and dendritic development of the hippocampal dentate granule cells would suggest a serious disturbance of normal hippocampal functioning.",
            "The reported behavioral changes in postnatally lead-exposed animals includes recur- rent seizures (19), impairment in motor coordination (20), and increased aggressiveness (21).",
            "The clinical syndrome caused by organolead, e.g., triethyl lead (TEL), the principal neurotoxic metabolite of tetraethyl lead, evolves through three phases: an initial phase of lethagy followed by tremors, hyperexcitability, hypermotility, and aggression leading finally to convulsions, ataxia, paralysis, and death (22).",
            "As with inorganic lead, acute and chronic syndromes may be identified.",
            "A single high dose (20 mg/kg TEL) produces a mixture of chromatolytic and necrotic neuronal changes, especially in the hippocampus and associated regions of the limbic system.",
            "Chronic, sublethal dosing also selectively produces a sporadic loss of neurons in the anterior pyriform cortex and hippocampus and effects on myelination in the developing brain (23,24).",
            "Of note is the relative sensitivity of the young adult animal to induction of this pathology compared to resistance of the suckling neonate.",
            "This age difference in dose response is in contrast to the inorganic lead model.",
            "Organolead toxicity produces a restricted pattern of neural damage involving primarily the limbic forebrain and frontal cortex (25,26).",
            "Trialkyl leads produce a variety of neuro- behavioral effects that resemble those induced by experimental damage to the limbic forebrain.",
            "The limbic system is thought to participate in the modulation of behavioral reac- tivity, motivation, learning, and memory (27).",
            "As previously mentioned, the neurotoxicity induced by the organoleads resembles the pattern of neurobehavioral deficits observed following limbic system damage.",

            "Recent observations sug- gest that the organoleads might produce some of their behav- ioral effects by disrupting benzodiazepine processes in the limbic forebrain known to modulate reactivity to aversive environmental stimuli (4).",
            "Our in vitro synaptosomal studies (28,29) have revealed a relative preferential sensitivity of -y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake to triethyl lead due to inhibition of GABA binding to the uptake site in synaptic membranes.",
            "Comparative Studies of Brain Neurochemistry: Lead and Organolead",
            "While the involvement of various neurotransmitter systems (e.g., cholinergic, noradrenergic, GABAergic, and dopa- minergic) have been proposed (30,31), most attention has been devoted to examining the interaction of the inorganic or organolead species with glutamate and GABA.",
            "Early studies by Bondy et al. (32) compared the effect of organic and inorganic lead on high-affinity neurotransmitter transport in adult mouse brain homogenates.",
            "The uptake and release of dopamine was especially affected by organolead at 10-8 M; inorganic Pb2+ was several orders of magnitude less toxic.",
            "However, the IDW for glutamate, dopamine, and GABA was found at approximately 10-6 M, suggesting a selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to lead.",
            "Such selective vulnerability is also suggested by the nature of the neurological deficit characterized as fine tremor, hyperactivity, and irritability, stigmata of dopaminergic function.",
            "The uptake studies were performed following 5 min incubation, thereby avoiding the problem of depleted ATP caused by uncoupling of synaptosomal oxidative phosphorylation (28,33).",
            "It is likely, therefore, that the selective inhibition of uptake of dopamine > GABA > glutamate is a reflec- tion of organolead interaction with specific uptake protein(s) within the membrane or with the immediate membrane envi- ronment as recently suggested for the GABA uptake site in the synaptic membrane (29).",
            "The lack of interaction with inorganic Pb2+ would appear to preclude a role for inor- ganic lead-induced deficits in neurotransmitter movement at low blood level concentrations in an understanding of the pathogenesis of lead toxicity.",
            "Attempts have been made to link the neurobehavioral and physiological effects of low-dose, chronic Pb2+ exposure to dopaminergic activity (34)(35)(36).",
            "Particularly relevant in this respect is the observation by (37), who demonstrated that low-dose Pb2+ exposure of the developing rat central nervous system caused a permanent increase in lithium-induced polydipsia (LIP).",
            "Subsequent studies showed that the LIP response was dependent on an intact nigrostriatal dopamine system (38).",
            "It is possible that the nigrostriatal pathway, although an integral part of the neural circuit mediating LIP, may not be the proximate site of Pb2+ interaction.",
            "For in- stance, the angiotensin-2 receptors present in the third ven- tricle (and hypothalamus) may be the primary locus of Pb2+ interaction.",
            "The limbic system serves as an interface between the hypothalamus and neocortex, and an early onset developmental abnormality in dopaminergic neuron matura- tion may account for the apparent limbic system-mediated behavioral abnormalities.",
            "The effects of lead on mitochondrial energy metabolism are potentially important in the pathogenesis of rat and human lead encephalopathy.",
            "Studies with inorganic Pb2+ have revealed effects on mitochondrial partal reactions significantly different from organolead.",
            "In vivo (39) and in vitro (40) effects of inorganic Pb2+ on immature rat brain mitochondrial res- piration are comparable.",
            "With all substrates, low Pb2+ con- centrations produced an increase in respiration.",
            "Higher concentrations produced an inhibition of respiration, inhibi- tion of ADP-dependent (stage 3) respiration, decrease in respiratory control ratio (41), and apparent dependence on extramitochondrial [PO3-] and [Mg2+].",
            "Such effects, in vitro, were evident at approximately 1 to 5 AtM lead con- centrations.",
            "The Pb2+-induced increase in respiration was shown to be associated with inward transport of Pb2+ by beef-heart mitochondria (42), an energy-dependent process with characteristics in common with mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation (43).",
            "Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake into mito- chondria is competitively inhibited by Pb2+ at a lower con- centration than the inhibition of respiration (44).",
            "The possibility that disturbances of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis may serve as a common pathway for neuronal injury allows for speculation on the possible mechanism underlying the acute cerebellar encephalopathy associated with Pb2+ exposure in immature rats and humans.",
            "The de- scribed effects on mitochondria will lead to a net decrease of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, increased mitochondrial Ca2+ effiux, increased mobilization of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum, and interference with the ATP-driven Ca2+- ATPase (45) located in the plasmalemma.",
            "It is possible, therefore, that the acute endothelial injury recognized as an early event in acute cerebellar Pb2+ encephalopathy is dependent on the abnormal mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ with a resultant increase of free cytosolic Ca2+.",
            "This scenario does not preclude the idea that Pb2+ may also act as a calcium-mimetic agent, somewhat similar to Hg2+ (46).",
            "In either event, elevated intracellular Ca2+ appears to play an important role in the mechanism of cell death in certain pathologic conditions (47)(48)(49).",
            "The organolead compounds are also well-documented tox- ins of energy metabolism in isolated mitochondria (50)(51)(52)(53)(54).",
            "While a potential relationship exists between the organolead- induced lesion in energy transduction and synaptic function, especially neurotransmitter reuptake and release, our studies (28) have not demonstrated such coupling for GABA uptake.",
            "Moreover, (33) confirmed the Cl--dependent uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by triethyl lead (28) and increased cytosolic free Ca2+ in cerebro-cortical synaptosomes.",
            "Such Ca2+ was derived from the intraterminal mitochondria subsequent to the uncoupling of mitochondrial ATP synthesis from oxidation.",
            "In summary, the neurotoxicity of organolead suggests a more acute mechanism underlying the patho- genesis of cellular injury.",
            "In particular, the dependence on Cland the changes in membrane depolarization coupled with the failure of bioenergetic potential and increased intra- cellular Ca2+ strongly suggest a mechanism of neuronal death analogous to the mechanisms of excitotoxic cell injury (55).",
            "Recent findings indicate that inorganic Pb2+ can substi- tute for Ca2+ with certain intracellular Ca2+-binding proteins (Table 3).",
            "Such observations suggest a variety of hypotheses for understanding the molecular basis of its toxic action, especially in reference to both the acute and low- level, chronic exposure models of neurotoxicity.",
            "Pb2+ inter- acts with calmoduiin with an affinity at least equal to that for Ca2+ (56).",
            "Lead may substitute for Ca2+ in a variety of Ca2+-dependent processes.",
            "Many of these processes are related to Ca2+ as a cytoplasmic second messenger, there- Table 3. Inorganic Pb2+ may replace Ca2l in select intracellular mechanisms (the Ca2+-mimetic effect of Pb2+).",

            "We have discussed the role of lead/calcium in mitochondrial bioenergetics, but of immediate interest to this discus- sion is the recent recognition that low concentrations of Pb2+ may stimulate brain protein kinase C (57).",
            "Protein kinase C is a Ca2+-and phospholipid-dependent enzyme known to mediate cellular proliferation and differentiation via phosphorylation of regulatory proteins (58).",
            "Our interest in this reaction is twofold: first, the remarkable heavy metal specificity to Pb2+ and sensitivity at 10-10 M when con- trasted to CaCl2.",
            "Second, the effective intracellular con- centration of 10-10 M would be reached following blood concentrations of between 5 and 10 ,ug/100 mL, representing approximately 10-6 M. Hence, the unique and marked sensitivity of protein kinase C to Pb2+ represents a poten- tial interaction at low, nonsymptomatic, chronic Pb2+ con- centrations, especially in the developing nervous system.",

            "Prolonga- tion of neuronal survival in culture is dependent on chronic depolarization usually maintained by high extracellular K+ (61-63).",
            "How depolarization affects neuronal survival and differentiation is unclear but increased [K+]e is known to activate voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (64), and Ca2+ entry has been implicated in the developmental effects of depolarization on neuronal survival and differentiation.",
            "Pb2+ uptake may occur via calcium channels (65).",
            "Simons and Pocock (65), using chromaffin cels, demonstrated an approx- imate 5-fold stimulation of Pb2+ uptake following K+ de- polarization, which was antagonized by external Ca2+ inhib- ited by Ca2+ channel blockers and stimulated by the Ca2+ agonist BAY K8644 (Table 4).",
            "More specifically, Gabo et al. (66) studied the role of depolrization on the survival and differentiation of cerebellar granule cells in culture and found that neuronal survival was not influenced by the bioelectric activity but was critically dependent on the depolarization-induced transmembrane Ca2+ flux (Table 5).",
            "Moreover, inhibitors of calmodulin blocked the differentiating effect of K+-induced depolarization.",
            "These observations link the survival and differentiation of neurons to a constant depolarization-coupled Ca2+ flux, Table 4.",

            "itself transduced by a calmodulin-dependent event(s) to neuronal differentiation, especially neurite outgrowth, speci- fication, and stabilization of synaptic contacts.",
            "A critical deter- minant of neurite organization is microtubule assembly regu- lated by the calmodulin-Ca2+ complex (67)(68)(69).",
            "How then can we explain the apparent differences in brain injury resulting from acute contrasted to low-level, chronic inorganic Pb2+ intoxication?",
            "In the acute model we may propose that Pb2+ uptake via Ca2+ channels (voltage sensi- tive and insensitive) into immature capillary endothelial cells will trigger intracellular processes leading to defective mito- chondrial bioenergetics and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, leading to cellular (endothelial) necrosis.",
            "In contrast, low-level, chronic Pb2+ exposure is manifested by subtle defects in axodendritic architecture and neurite organization secondary to defective cytoskeletal organization.",
            "The need for continued depolarization in neuronal development is linked to stimulation of Pb2+ uptake and the resultant high-affinity binding to Ca2+ binding proteins, especially calmodulin.",
            "The abnormal and possibly prolonged activation of calmodulin-dependent processes, especially the activation of protein kinase C, will lead to distorted transmembrane signalling and defective neuronal differentiation (Table 6).",

            "Workers exposed to naphthalene and its homologues were engaged as operators in the tar distillation process (group A) and as operators in the naphthalene oil distillation process (group B).",
            "Information about some characteristics of the attendants (age, length of employment, smoking habits) were obtained from self-completed questionnaires (table 1).",
            "Unfortunately, better age selection was impossible because of the small number of workers employed in a particular job.",
            "The reference group (C) comprised 25 men and 11 women who lived in the same area as the workers, but who were not occupationally exposed.",

            "A carbon disulfide extract of air and an ethyl acetate extract of urine were used.",

            "Results",
            "The GC-MS analysis of the compounds adsorbed on active carbon revealed the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly naphthalene and methylated naphthalenes, in the breathing-zone air of the coke plant workers.",
            "A representative chromatogram is shown in figure 1.",
            "The hydrocarbons were identified as being naphthalene, methyl-and dimethylnaphthalene isomers, and trimethylnaphthalene, biphenyl, and benzo[b]thiophene.",
            "These compounds are included in the high-temperature naphthalene fraction of tar.",
            "In figure 1 naphthols are not seen because these compounds were adsorbed on silica gel as separate samples.",
            "Figure 2 illustrates a chromatogram obtained for samples prepared from the urine of workers engaged as operators of the naphthalene oil distillation process and exposed to naphthalene and its homologues.",
            "Three oxygenated naphthalene metabolites isolated from urine were identified as 1-naphthol, 2-naphthol, and 1,4naphthoquinone.",
            "In the urine of the exposed workers, 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxypheny1)ethanone and 1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one were identified.",
            "The two last-mentioned compounds were also found in the urine of the unexposed subjects, possibly because of the normal metabolic process, as well as because of environmental exposure.",
            "The naphthalene and 1-and 2-naphthol concentrations that were above the analytical detection limits for the air and urine samples were found to be distributed log-normally.",
            "Table 2 presents the concentrations of naphthalene in the breathing-zone air and those of 1 -and 2-naphthols in the urine collected from the workers directly after the end of the workshift.",
            "The urinary metabolite levels are expressed as observed or corrected for creatinine concentration or corrected for a specific gravity of urine equal to 1.024.",
            "Urine samples with creatinine concentrations below 2.6 pmoltl or above 26 pmoltl and with the specific gravity values below 1.010 and above 1.030 were removed from the analysis.",
            "The presence of the 1and 2-naphthols in the urine of workers is a result of the exposure to naphthalene, as well as to low amounts of naphthols found in the breathing-zone air.",
            "Concentrations of the 1-and 2-naphthols in air were about 40 to 60 times lower than the concentrations of naphthalene.",
            "Group B comprises workers for which 1-and 2-naphthols were found simultaneously.",
            "The percentage of 1naphthol in the mixture of naphthols (1-and 2-naphthols) differed for subsequent workers, covering the  range of 22.5-90.7% with the mean value of 64.8 (SD 61.3)%.",
            "Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between the concentrations of 1-and Znaphthols in the urine of the exposed workers (groups A and B) and the reference group (C).",
            "The correlations between the time-weighted average naphthalene exposure and the 1-and %-naphthols in the end-shift urine were examined by regression analysis.",
            "After logarithmic transformation, they had a linear form.",

            "The correlation coefficients for the dependence between the naphthol concentrations in urine and the naphthalene concentrations in the breathing-zone air were statistically significant at P < 0.001.",
            "However, they were relatively low, varying within the range of 0.64-0.75 for 1-naphthol and 0.70-0.82 for 2-naphthol.",
            "The correction of the metabolite level against creatinine or the specific gravity of urine did not increase the correlation coefficients (table 3, figure 3).",
            "A strong correlation (r = 0.76) was found between the summary concentration of naphthols in urine and air (see figure 4 C).",

            "The threshold limit value (TLV) has been set at 10 ppm (52 mg/m3) (20).",
            "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (21) considers more than 500 ppm of naphthalene in air to be immediately dangerous to life or health.",
            "Bjeirseth et a1 (22) have reported vapor levels of 1.1 to 11 pg/m3 in a coke plant.",
            "Higher levels would be anticipated in naphthalene-producing industries and naphthalene-using industries such as wood preserving, coal-tar production, and the production of dyes, inks and similar compounds (1 3).",
            "Adsorbed naphthalene was determined by the method recommended by NIOSH (23), which calls for desorption of the charcoal with a carbon disulfide solution and quantification gas chromatographically.",
            "Naphthalene shows poor desorption efficiency at low loading.",
            "For higher efficiency NIOSH (23) recommends a minimum sampling volume of 100 1.",
            "In spite of the low desorption from charcoal, this method is the favored means of sampling naphthalene from air for analysis.",
            "The biological monitoring of naphthalene provides a better estimation of the adsorbed substances than measurements of the corresponding contaminates in air because the skin can be the main route of exposure (16).",
            "Naphthalene metabolism is complex and leads to the formation of a wide assortment of hydroxylated derivatives, quinones, and conjugates of glucuronic acid, glutathione, and sulfate (24).",
            "Immunological techniques are being developed for the identification of naphthalene mercapturic acid derivatives in urine (25) and naphthalene hemoglobin adducts in blood (26).",
            "Traditionally, the most common method used for the biological monitoring of naphthalene exposure has been based on measuring a metabolite of naphthalene, usually urinary I-naphthol.",
            "Some caution must be exercised in using 1-naphthol as a biomarker of naphthalene exposure in the general population because this metabolite is also excreted after exposure to the common insecticide carbaryl (27).",
            "Investigations by Connor et a1 (28) have shown that smoking can contribute to the excretion of 1naphthol in urine.",
            "Recent studies have demonstrated that the maximum concentration of 1-naphthol in the urine of operators working with the naphthalene oil distillation process appears 1 h after the end of a shift (15).",
            "The 1naphthol concentration was the highest in the morning before the workday.",
            "Measurements taken at this time of day probably reflect the exposure on the previous day (16).",
            "The present study attempted to evaluate the relation between naphthalene exposure and various recently developed biomarkers so that a biological exposure index corresponding to naphthalene exposure can be estimated.",
            "Our results show that most naphthalene is metabolized to 1-and 2-naphthol and 1,4-naphthoquinone (figure 2).",
            "Small amounts of 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol are excreted in the urine after the dermal application of naphthalene (4).",
            "In an earlier study it has been shown that there is a good statistical correlation between 1-naphthol excretion and naphthalene exposure in the concelltration range of 0.2-6 mg/m3.",
            "This urinary metabolite can indicate exposure to both naphthalene and low concentrations of 1-naphthol during the naphthalene oil distillation process (15).",
            "Our study confirms a previous assumption that there is a correlation between the presence of naphthalene in air and the urinary excretion of 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol, which are two major oxygenated metabolites of naphthalene.",
            "Significant correlations between I-naph-tho1 or 2-naphthol and naphthalene exposure (figures 3 and 4) were found.",
            "It is important to stress that the present study was cassied out among workers in a coke plant.",
            "The workers were exposed to numerous other volatile compounds in addition to naphthalene (figure 1).",
            "Several aromatic hydrocarbons in tar and naphthalene oil are known to have either synergistic or antagonistic effects on coexposure to naphthalene.",
            "The GC-MS analysis of breathing-zone air showed that the coke plant workers employed in the naphthalene oil distillation process are simultaneously exposed to naphthalene, 1 -and 2-methylnaphthalenes, dimethylnaphthalene isomers, trimethylnaphthalene (figure 1) and other compounds (Bieniek & Kurkiewicz, unpublished results).",
            "In conclusion, our results show the existence of low exposure to naphthalene, which is however qualitatively diversified in coke plants.",

            "The soil samples were collected randomly within the Muledane open dump, Thohoyandou, Limpopo province, South Africa.",
            "Control samples were collected about 200 m away from the open dump.",

            "The results were compared statistically.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Our results revealed that the discarding of wastes into the open dump is a potential source of soil contamination in the immediate vicinity and beyond, via dispersal.",

            "Sustained monitoring of these contaminants is recommended, in addition to upgrading the facility to a landfill.",
            "Background",
            "The dumping of waste on soils has been found to increase their phthalate esters and metals concentrations.",
            "Soil contaminants may be divided into two groups: organic contaminants, which contain carbon, and inorganic contaminants, which do not contain carbon.",
            "The organic contaminants of greatest concern are industrial in origin, and include agricultural pesticides and non-pesticide compounds like phthalate esters; whereas most important inorganic contaminants are metals, originating from industrial processes.",
            "The disposal of waste poses major environmental and public health problems in cities across the world.",
            "This has become a source of concern for rural and urban planners.",
            "With increasing populations, urbanization and spatial growth in South Africa, most open dumps are now close to residential areas.",
            "The Muledane open dump in Thohoyandou is now in the heart of Muledane housing estate.",
            "Its location presents serious threats to, amongst other things, the quality of ground and surface water via contaminant leaching and runoffs.",
            "It has been documented that organisms inhabiting contaminated soils take up pollutants, which can bioaccumulate in the complex food chain.",
            "Despite this, open dumps remain the preferred management method for the disposal of municipal solid waste in many developing countries.",
            "Lack of space for dumping solid waste has become a problem for many urban managers, who are concerned about the increasing costs of waste disposal and the possible hazards to water supply and air quality.",
            "The dialkyl or alkyl aryl esters of 1, 2-benzenedicarboxylic acid \u2013 commonly called phthalate esters \u2013 have a myriad of commercial uses, and are considered ubiquitous environmental contaminants.",
            "Globally, over 8 billion tonnes of phthalate esters are used each year primarily as additives to poly (vinyl) chloride (PVC) plastics, industrial solvents and components of many consumer products.",
            "Phthalates have been implicated as possible carcinogenic and teratogenic agents for humans.",
            "However, it is the possible action of phthalates as endocrine disrupters in humans that has caused the most serious concern.",
            "The toxic effects to humans and wildlife of metals such as cadmium and lead are well known.",
            "Even in small amounts humans do not require this category of metals.",
            "Similarly, elevated levels of essential metals like zinc, manganese and iron have been found to be toxic.",
            "Calcium, on the other hand, enhances the toxicity and bioavailability of metals like cadmium and zinc.",
            "The objective of this study was to evaluate the levels of some phthalate esters (dimethyl phthalate, (DMP), diethyl phthalate, (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), diethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP)) and metals (lead, cadmium, manganese, zinc, iron, calcium) in the Muledane open dump soils in relation to control soil samples.",
            "This is expected to provide baseline data that will assist the municipal and provincial authorities in adopting and enforcing a sustainable waste disposal and management system especially in South Africa's emerging urban settlements.",
            "Results and Discussion",
            "The mean soil pH values are 6.55 \u00b1 0.44 and 6.10 \u00b1 0.72 (Table 1) for the open dump and control samples respectively.",
            "These values fall within the range of 6.00\u20137.00 expected for most tropical soils.",
            "The open dump soil's mean pH value of 6.55 \u00b1 0.44 is however lower than the values 7.40 \u2013 10.4 previously reported for some Lagos dumpsites.",
            "Soil pH is a very important factor in controlling the mobility and availability of metals.",
            "High pH reduces the plant availability of most metals.",
            "With a tcal value of 1.18 compared to the ttab value of 2.31, the soil pH values are non-significantly different at 95% confidence level (Table 1).",
            "The mean percentage moisture content shown in Table 1 reveals values ranging from 9.29 \u00b1 1.51 to 10.89 \u00b1 2.83.",
            "These relatively low values are expected of tropical soil sampled before the onset of heavy tropical rains.",
            "However, the open dump and control soil samples exhibit non-significant differences at 95% confidence level, an indication of some degree of similarity in soil texture.",
            "The phthalate esters were eluted from the gas chromatographic column in the order: DMP, DEP, DBP, and DEHP.",
            "The following retention times (min) were obtained: DMP, 2.25 \u00b1 002; DEP, 3.03 \u00b1 0.03; DBP, 5.73 \u00b1 0.03; DEHP, 0.98 \u00b1 0.05.",
            "The method detection limit (MDL) and instrument detection limit (IDL) are as follows (ng/kg): DMP, 40.17 and 20.46; DEP, 48.89 and 20.46; DBP, 87.52 and 3.80; DEHP, 14.61 and 1.09 respectively for MDL and IDL.",
            "The percentage recoveries from spiking experiments are: DMP, 89.08 \u00b1 0.51; DEP, 89.95 \u00b1 0.34; DBP, 88.72 \u00b1 0.55; DEHP, 89.04 \u00b1 0.48.",
            "The unrestricted dumping of domestic and medical waste materials made of plastic is the likely source of phthalate esters in the soil samples.",
            "Table 2 provides a list of phthalate esters separated and detected in the soil samples as well as the phthalate pollution index (PPI).",
            "Similarly, the t-test, statistical analyses of phthalate esters concentration in the open dump and control soil samples are shown in Table 3.",
            "The DMP, DEP, DBP and DEHP levels (mg/kg) in the open dump samples are 0.31 \u00b1 0.12, 0.21 \u00b1 0.05, 0.30 \u00b1 0.07 and 0.031 \u00b1 0.01, respectively.",
            "However, the control soil samples have values (mg/kg) of 0.20 \u00b1 0.12, 0.18 \u00b1 0.02, 0.23 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.02 \u00b1 0.01 respectively for DMP, DEP, DBP and DEHP.",
            "Biosolids from five treatment plants in greater Vancouver, British Columbia, reveal DMP, DEP, DBP and DEHP values (mg/kg) of 0.13 \u00b1 0.34, 0.15 \u00b1 0.14, 0.15 \u00b1 0.15 and 2.70 \u00b1 2.70 respectively.",
            "These values \u2013 except for DEHP \u2013 are found to be lower than the levels reported for the Muledane open dump soil samples (Table 2).",
            "Nevertheless, contaminated soils in Ontario, Canada, as reported have DMP, DEP and DBP levels of < 15 mg/kg, and DEHP burden of < 250 mg/kg.",
            "A statistical comparison of DMP, DEP, DBP and DEHP concentrations in the respective soil samples reveal non-significant differences at p < 0.05.",
            "A similar trend has been observed before, and may be taken as an indication of low levels of organic contaminant pollution in the open dump.",
            "Some degree of plastic recycling activities in the vicinity of the open dump may be responsible for this.",
            "Of concern, however, is the detection of DEHP in the soil samples, ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 mg/kg in the open dump soils, and 0.02 to 0.03 mg/kg in the control soil samples.",
            "DEHP is regarded as having the most deleterious endocrine disrupting capability, resulting in the European Union's (EU) having restricted its use.",
            "The maximum admissible concentration (MAC) for the other low molecular weight phthalates, such as DMP, DEP and DBP, has, however, been established by most countries.",
            "The phthalate pollution index (PPI) for the soil samples is relatively low at 0.12 \u2013 0.20 (open dump) and 0.09 \u2013 0.14 (control).",
            "It is instructive to note, however, that the PPI is higher for the open dump soil samples.",
            "Although non-significant levels are recorded between open dump and control samples, regular monitoring is imperative, due to the expected increase in urbanization and industrialization of Thohoyandou in the years ahead.",
            "The metal recovery studies to assure quality gave the following the percentage recoveries: Pb, 90.21 \u00b1 0.004; Cd, 95.40 \u00b1 0.005; Mn, 89.94 \u00b1 0.003, Zn, 93.14 \u00b1 0.002, Fe, 91.64 \u00b1 0.004; Ca, 94.71 \u00b1 0.003.",
            "The burden of metals (Table 4) in the soil samples collected from the open dump is generally higher than those of samples collected from the control site.",
            "This trend has been observed before in open dump soils.",
            "The mean lead, cadmium, manganese, zinc, iron and calcium levels for the control site are (in mg/kg): 0.04 \u00b1 0.01, 0.004 \u00b1 0.001, 3.94 \u00b1 3.33, 0.11 \u00b1 0.05, 11.69 \u00b1 6.19 and 0.04 \u00b1 0.03 respectively.",
            "Whereas the values for the open dump samples are (mg/kg): 0.07 \u00b1 0.04, 0.003 \u00b1 0.001, 5.02 \u00b1 1.92, 0.31 \u00b1 0.12, 11.62 \u00b1 9.48 and 0.21 \u00b1 0.13 for lead, cadmium, manganese, zinc, iron and calcium respectively.",
            "There exist statistically significant differences (95% confidence level) in the concentrations of zinc in the soil samples (Table 5).",
            "This may be taken as an indication of zinc pollution in the open dump.",
            "Waste materials in the open dump containing metals are likely sources of the additional burden when compared to the control levels.",
            "The metal concentration levels obtained here were generally lower than the average world values reported earlier.",
            "This may not be unconnected with the fact that the Thulamela municipality is still evolving economically.",
            "The concerns regarding zinc are its toxicity to aquatic species, its ability to bioaccumulate, and the interrelationship of zinc with cadmium and lead.",
            "Similarly, calcium, iron and zinc play major roles in interfering with cadmium adsorption in the human intestine.",
            "Soil losses of soluble calcium salts gradually lead to decalcification of the soil and thus to lower pH.",
            "This process may be accelerated under wet conditions.",
            "Nevertheless, the levels of lead, cadmium, manganese and iron are non-significantly different at 95% confidence level.",
            "It is noteworthy that the burden of lead and cadmium in the open dump is relatively high enough to raise public health concerns.",
            "These metals are not required even in small amounts by living organisms.",
            "The metal pollution index (MPI) shown in Table 4 reveals values ranging from 0.13\u20130.45 for open dump soil samples, and 0.08\u201321 for the control samples.",
            "These values are relatively high and could be a cause of future concern when related to pollution indexes reported earlier in literature.",
            "The paucity of data on the levels of organic and inorganic pollutants and limit values in the country necessitates reference to values in other countries and organizations.",
            "Consequently, results from this study may constitute baseline data to fill this gap.",
            "Conclusion",
            "The study showed that the dumping of wastes in the open dump has the potential to pollute the environment, especially via dispersal.",
            "This is revealed by the statistically non-significant differences in the levels of phthalate esters and metals (except for zinc), in the open dump and control soil samples.",
            "We can conclude, however, that the phthalate esters and metals may not presently constitute a serious pollution problem.",
            "Nevertheless, the presence of the phthalates and metals as contaminants at these relatively low levels is of concern from the point of view of bioaccumulation.",
            "The increased levels of metals and phthalate esters in the soil pose risks to public health, plants and animals, with serious implications for the development of housing, industrial estates and agriculture.",
            "There is need for the Thulamela municipal government to evolve a sustained pollutants monitoring program.",
            "Similarly, the open dump should be upgraded to a landfill to cope with the economic growth in the locality.",

            "Soil samples were collected randomly from the Muledane open dump, located approximately 4.7 km from the central business district (CBD) of Thohoyandou, in the far northern Venda region, of the Limpopo province, South Africa.",
            "It is on the Southern side of the Soutpansberg Mountain and falls within the tropical belt of South Africa.",

            "The sampling was carried out between March and May, 2005.",
            "The soil samples collected were air-dried for six days, sieved through 0.45 \u03bcm mesh sieve and stored for analysis.",
            "The wastes in the open dump were predominantly domestic, agricultural, and industrial waste materials trucked down to the location.",
            "The site started as an uncontrolled open dump in 1989 and was upgraded in 2003 to an appreciably organized open dump by the Thulamela municipality.",
            "The open dump is now in the vicinity of the Muledane residential housing estate and poses a potential health threat to the residents.",
            "The choice of the determined potential contaminants \u2013 phthalate esters and metals (lead, cadmium, manganese, zinc, iron and calcium) \u2013 was informed by the nature of wastes in the site.",

            "Prospective studies found that low dietary intake of folate and high alcohol consumption were associated with promoter hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation in CRC tissue from 122 and 609 patients respectively.",
            "Such modulations are considered to lead to inactivation of tumour suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes.",
            "A causal relationship between folate, alcohol and methylation changes was supported by animal studies.,",
            "A subset of CRC patients are characterised by methylation abnormalities in a large number of genes (CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)).",
            "MTHFR encodes the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, which enables the utilisation of methyl groups for DNA synthesis.",
            "A high risk of CIMP-CRC was observed among MTHFR A1298C variant allele carriers with low intake of folate and methionine and high alcohol intake (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3\u20133.4), which was in contrast to variant allele carriers with high intake of folate and methionine and low alcohol intake (OR: 1.0, 95% CI: 0.5\u20131.8) in a case\u2013control study of 916 cases and 1972 controls (P-interaction 0.03) (reference: homozygous wildtype genotype).",
            "This result may suggest that the risk associated with carrying the MTHFR A1298C variant allele can be overcome by a high intake of folate and methionine and low alcohol intake.",
            "A recent meta-analysis found inverse association between blood selenium level and CRC in men.",
            "Although no human studies on selenium and epigenetic in relation to CRC were found, a causal relationship may be suggested by animal and colon cancer cell studies finding that selenium deficiency leads to DNA methylation abnormalities and that selenium supplementation suppressed aberrant DNA methylation.",
            "However, genetic variations in genes encoding selenoproteins were not associated with CRC risk and blood selenium level in a prospective nested case\u2013control study of 804 colorectal cancer cases and 805 matched controls and no interaction was found between selenium intake and genetic polymorphisms in selenoproteins in relation to risk of CRC in a large case\u2013control study including 2309 CRC cases.",
            "Discussion",
            "Candidate gene analyses of functional genetic polymorphisms, i.e. with known functional effects on the gene product such as enzymatic activity, allow interpretation of negative results as well as positive.",
            "Hence, the analysis may exclude the involvement of a gene in a process.",
            "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may be hampered by lack of knowledge on the functionality of the identified loci, heterogeneity in exposure among populations and difficulties in assessing environmental exposure.",
            "Genetic variants in different genes having similar phenotypic effects may act in the same functional pathway.",
            "Therefore, methods for pathway analyses to increase harvest are under development.,",
            "Such strategy will increase the fraction explained by the genetic heritability of various diseases.",
            "Potential sources of errors in assessment of diet in observational studies results from (i) inaccurate diet assessment, (ii) the fact that changes in diet occur over time, while diet assessment is usually only assessed once and (iii) co-variation in diet with other CRC risk factors.",
            "Co-linearity between red meat intake and other potential risk factors such as Western lifestyle, high intake of refined sugars and alcohol, low intake of fibre, fruits, vegetables, low physical activity and high smoking prevalence have been emphasised and may hamper the interpretation of the results.",
            "Prospective studies have the advantage that information on diet and lifestyle factors is collected for all participants at enrolment, which minimises the risk of differential misclassification between cases and controls.",
            "In particular, recall bias regarding food intake may hamper case\u2013control studies.",
            "Also, the intake of the diet under investigation should be sufficiently distributed in the population to allow evaluation of various intakes.",
            "The Danish \u2018Diet, health and cancer\u2019 cohort seems to provide a platform for studying the potential carcinogenic effect of red and processed meat because many Danes have a high meat intake.",
            "The impact of the combined effects of diet and genetic susceptibility may thus be evaluated.",
            "For example, the NFKB1 -94ins/del del-allele was associated with risk of CRC among Swedes [odds ratio (OR) 3.81, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.17\u201318.43, P < 0.0001 for heterozygous del-carriers and OR: 4.65, 95% CI: 2.43\u20138.89, P < 0.0001 for homozygous del-carriers], whereas no association was found among Chinese.",
            "An explanation for this apparent discrepancy may be suggested by the interaction between meat and NFKB1 -94ins/del polymorphism found in the Danish cohort.",
            "Among NFKB1 -94ins/del variant allele carriers, risk of CRC depends on meat intake.",
            "Thus, for intakes below 91.4 g red meat per day (the lowest tertile), OR was 1.19 (95% CI: 0.75\u20131.91), 1.79 (95% CI: 1.06\u20132.74) for intakes between 91.4 and 130.2 g per day, and 1.44 (95% CI: 0.89\u20132.34) for intakes above 130.2 g red meat per day (the highest tertile) respectively.",
            "Hence, the difference between the findings in the Danish and Swedish on one hand and the Chinese on the other may be related to differences in meat intake.",
            "In most other prospective studies, the study members had meat intakes, which correspond to the lowest tertile in the above-mentioned Danish study, and gene\u2013meat interactions may thus be below detection level.",
            "Therefore, to allow comparison between populations, risk should ideally be reported per unit of exposure, e.g. per 100 g meat intake per day.",
            "When these criteria are met, studies on diet\u2013gene interactions may provide valuable insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the various dietary items in colorectal carcinogenesis.",
            "During the last years, it has become increasingly apparent that sporadic CRC encompasses a heterogeneous complex of diseases.",
            "Hence, multiple diet\u2013gene interactions may contribute to CRC risk.",
            "To conclude, prospective studies suggest that dietary meat interact with NAT1, NAT2, ABCB1, NFKB1, but not HMOX1, ABCC2 or ABCG2, cruciferous vegetables with GSTM1, GSTT1, and CCND1, calcium with VDR, vitamin C, vitamin E and carotene with MGTM, fibre with IL10, alcohol with PPARG, folate and alcohol with DNA methylation in relation to CRC.",
            "These interactions have to be replicated in other prospective studies before conclusions regarding biological mechanisms can be drawn.",
            "Further progress will involve the combined efforts of epidemiologists, molecular geneticists, statisticians and clinicians.",
            "Studies of diet\u2013gene interactions necessitate large and well-designed cohorts such as population-based cohorts, prospectively recorded data, sufficient distribution of the intake of the examined diet in the cohort, the analyses of genetic variations in functional pathways, and, moreover, the comparison of cohorts with similar exposures.",
            "Such studies may provide valuable insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the various dietary items in colorectal carcinogenesis with the goal of reducing the prevalence of CRC.",

            "In six other studies, elevated lung cancer risks were found overall or among subcohorts; however, few of these excesses were statistically significant due to moderate excess risks and/or small numbers of cases (7)(8)(9)(11)(12)(13).",
            "Because of the uncertainty in the literature regarding the association between VCM exposure and lung cancer and because of the diversity of occupational chemical exposures experienced by the lung cancer cases in our previous study (1), we decided to evaluate our cohort further to determine whether or not lung cancer was associated with VCM or with other chemical exposures.",
            "Thus, the following research had three objectives: (1) by using a retrospective cohort design, to determine if our previously published excess lung cancer risk among employees exposed to VCM at this synthetic plastics plant also existed for the total plant popula- tion (2) by using a case-comparand study, to de- termine whether an excess lung cancer risk of a particular histologic type was in force at the plant and (3) by using a serially additive expected dose model, to test whether one or more particular chemicals used at the plant were associated with either the excess risk of all or of a specific histologic type of lung cancer.",
            "Methods and Results",
            "Retrospective Cohort Study",
            "The population at risk for the retrospective cohort study consisted of the 4806 males ever employed at this plant from its opening in 1942 until December 31, 1973.",
            "In the absence of individual data on race, everyone was assumed to be white because the company indicated that less than 2% of the population had been nonwhite.",
            "Date of birth and detailed work histories at this plant of all jobs and dates worked by each individual were coded.",
            "By follow-up of all study members from the first date hired at the plant through December 31, 1973, it was determined that 4174 were alive and 559 had died.",
            "The 73 (1.5%) persons lost to follow-up were considered alive throughout the study.",
            "The 16 (3%) deceased persons for whom no death certificates could be located were assumed dead, cause of death unknown.",
            "A modified life table analysis (NIOSH) was used to obtain person years at risk of dying by five year age and calendar time periods.",
            "United States white male death rates specific for five year age and calendar intervals were used to calculate the expected deaths and standardized mortality ratios (SMR's).",
            "SMR's were tested for statistical significance using the Poisson distribution (onesided).",
            "The cohort was young; by December 31, 1973, only 30% of the cohort, if alive, would have been over 54 years of age.",
            "However, 63% of the cohort had been hired before 1954 and thus had the oppor- tunity to achieve 20 years' latency.",
            "Two separate analyses of the cohort were made.",
            "Initially, all members were considered at risk from their first date of employment at the plant.",
            "This analysis yielded 556 observed and 550 expected deaths (Table 1).",
            "Risk of death due to malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system (SMR = 209) and respiratory system (SMR = 149) were both significantly elevated.",
            "A second \"over ten- year latency\" analysis was carried out by beginning person-years at risk only after an individual had achieved the tenth anniversary of his first date of employment at the plant.",
            "Results similar to those in the first cohort analysis were found but with slightly higher SMR's.",
            "Respiratory system cancer had an SMR of 156 based on 39 observed cases.",
            "Because our previously published analysis (1) of just the presumably VCM-exposed workers at this plant 160",
            "Case-Comparand Study",
            "The second objective of this study was to deter- mine whether an excess risk existed for a particular histologic type of lung cancer.",
            "Because no historical data exist on histology-specific lung cancer inci- dence or mortality rates and because histologic classification is somewhat variable between pathologists and over time, a case-comparand design was chosen to accomplish the second objective.",
            "Medical records and pathology reports were obtained on all deceased members of the cohort whose death certificates mentioned cancer or respiratory disease.",
            "For 45 cohort members, primary or un- specified lung cancer was reported on at least one of these three records.",
            "A few persons who died after December 31, 1973, the cohort ending date, were included.",
            "Of the 45 cases, 42 were born in Kentucky or an adjacent state.",
            "Histologic material was re- quested.",
            "The worker case group consisted of the 27 of the 45 deceased individuals for whom histologic specimens were available.",
            "As a comparison group, the lung cancer cases (comparands) most closely preceding and succeed- ing the chemical plant worker case in the chronologically ordered hospital pathology logs were selected that matched in age at diagnosis, sex, race, and county of residence.",
            "For four cases, only one matched comparand could be found.",
            "Histologic material was reviewed by a panel of pathologists unaware of the employment histories (case versus comparand status) of the deceased.",
            "The histologic type distributions, according to the Environmental Health Perspectives Veterans' Administration classification scheme (14), were compared between the cases and comparands.",
            "The results of the majority opinion of the pathology panel are listed in Table 2.",
            "The panel found a significantly (p < 0.05, chi-square) higher percentage of large cell undifferentiated (type 4) cancers among the worker cases than among the community comparands (30% vs. 10%).",
            "By using the SMR for respiratory system cancer of 149 in the retrospective cohort study and the observed and expected histologic distribution of lung cancer deaths based on the case-comparand study, Table 3 demonstrates the calculation of histology specific lung cancer SMR's (column C).",
            "If the 27 cases for which histologic specimens were available are considered representative of all 45 lung cancer cases, it appears the excess lung cancer risk appears limited to types 3 and 4, adenocarcinoma and large cell undifferentiated, with the greater risk due to the latter.",
            "Approximately 13.5 of the 14.8 excess lung cancers among the plant workers would be due to adenocarcinoma and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma.",
            "It appears that there is a histology-specific excess lung cancer risk among workers at this plant and that this differential distribution of cell types is not an artifact of the geographic region nor of the pathologist's techniques.",
            "The fact that this risk occurs for adenocarcinomas and for large cell undifferentiated lung cancers makes it very unlikely that it is due to cigarette smoking.",
            "Serially Additive Expected Dose Model",
            "The third objective was to test whether any presumed occupational chemical exposures were associated with the excess lung cancer risk at the plant.",
            "It was decided to analyze the previously mentioned cohort data in a serially additive ex- pected dose (SAED) model ( 10), obtaining for each lung cancer case the observed and expected doses of each chemical, conditional on certain characteristics.",
            "The purpose of the SAED model is to compare the observed exposure of each case in a study with the exposures of fellow workers close to the case in year of birth, and in age at commencement of work at the company.",
            "If the total work force in the plant under study is referred to as the cohort, then each case can be thought of as belonging to a subcohort of workers with approximately the same year of birth and age at commencement of work in the plant.",
            "In each year that a case worked at the plant, his exposure can be compared with that of the other members of his subcohort who were working in that year.",
            "Company personnel compiled estimated exposures on a scale of 0 to 5 (5 being the highest exposure) for each of 19 chemicals (Table 4).",
            "Each job was as- signed an exposure rank for each calendar year of the study (Table 5).",
            "These exposure data were then linked with work histories identifying the jobs each worker had in the plant and the calendar time involved.",
            "The analytical method is based on esti- mating exposure dose by multiplying the exposure level by the number of days worked at that level.",
            "These \"doses\" are accumulated over a calendar year for a case to yield the observed dose and for cSpecific cell types do not add up to total because of \"other\" type lung cancer among comparands.",
            "October 1981 his subcohort to yield an expected dose for each year that a case works.",
            "The methodology has pre- viously been described in detail elsewhere (10).",
            "In addition to testing the total-dose hypothesis, the SAED analysis facilitates examination of the observed and expected doses for each year of exposure before death.",
            "Exposures to 19 chemicals were assessed; seven of the chemicals were, however, excluded from the formal analysis because so few persons were exposed to them at levels 3, 4 and 5 (Table 6).",
            "The SAED model analysis resulted in the ob- served minus expected cumulative dose differences per case in Table 7.",
            "The differences for PVC dust are striking in comparison with the other expo- sures.",
            "For the large cell undifferentiated cancer and adenocarcinomas combined and for large cell undifferentiated cancer by itself, the differences in exposure to PVC dust are three to four times as large as those estimated for vinylidene chloride, the Environmental Health Perspectives next most evident chemical.",
            "The significance levels of the larger of these differences are found in Table 8 for the total cumulative doses and also for cumula- tive doses until 10 years before death.",
            "Statistical significance was observed only for exposure to PVC dust.",
            "Latency analysis for PVC dust (Fig. 1) shows a peak for the difference between observed minus expected dose during the period 5 to 16 years before death.",
            "As the diagnosis of the disease of interest becomes more narrowly defined as a patho- logically homogeneous entity, the dose difference per case increases, yet the implied latent period stays constant.",
            "Discussion",
            "The first objective of this study was to determine if the excess lung cancer risk among employees exposed to VCM also existed for the total plant population, including those persons not exposed to VCM.",
            "The retrospective cohort mortality study showed that respiratory system cancers occurred approximately 50% more frequently among the em- ployees of the entire plant than would have been expected based on age, sex, race, and calendar year specific United States death rates.",
            "A similar excess had been previously shown to exist among the subcohort of employees exposed to VCM (1).",
            "Thus, the excess lung cancer risk at the plant appeared to be independent of VCM exposure unless one hy- pothesized that it was due to extremely low levels Table 8.",
            "Probability value of paired t-tests of cumulative differences between observed and expected doses for lung cancer cases.",
            "10  aTwelve chemicals were tested for each lung cancer group, thus, under an assumption of independence of tests, one would exrect one test to be significant at the 0.08 level.",

            "October 1981 of VCM that could have permeated throughout the plant.",
            "Potentially confounding variables are age, sex, calendar year, race/ethnicity, migration, urban res- idence, cigarette smoking and socioeconomic status (SES).",
            "In the retrospective cohort study, age and calendar year cannot confound because they are adjusted in the results.",
            "All persons in the study are male and 98% are presumed white.",
            "White male specific rates were used for comparison to control those potential confounders by subject category re- striction.",
            "Ethnicity and migration (both inter-and intracountry) effects are considered minimal for all three study designs because 42 of the 45 cases were born in Kentucky or an adjacent state.",
            "Urban resi- dence is mainly associated with an excess of epidermoid and small cell undifferentiated lung can- cer (15) rather than the histologic types of lung cancer found in excess in this study.",
            "Excess lung cancer risk is associated with low socioeconomic status (16, 17), measured either by education (relative risk of 1.2 for persons with fewer than eight years of school) or by occupation (relative risk of 1.3 for laborers).",
            "Since the cohort consists of a mixture of socioeconomic status levels, there is probably insignificant confounding due to SES at the plant considered as a whole.",
            "Furthermore, recent infor- mation indicates that these risk gradients may be partially due to smoking patterns (18,19), which would affect epidermoid and small cell undifferentiated lung cancers.",
            "The second objective of this research was to determine whether an excess lung cancer risk of a particular histologic type existed.",
            "The case-comparand study showed that there was an excess of adenocarcinomas and large cell undifferentiated lung cancers among the cases occurring among plant employees compared to other lung cancer cases from the same community.",
            "Because the pathologists reviewed both sets of slides without knowing which were those of plant employees, it is unlikely diagnostic biases occurred.",
            "Histologic specimens were more difficult to find among the cases which died earlier and which were older on the date of death.",
            "However, community comparands were matched with the cases on age and date of diagnosis and had to have specimens available themselves; hence a biased ascertainment by histology between cases and comparands would be unlikely.",
            "The choice of community comparands makes it unlikely that a community wide pollutant was responsible for the excess risk at the plant for types 3 and 4 lung cancer.",
            "Consequently, it can be inferred from Table 3 that the excess lung cancer risk in the cohort was limited to adenocarcinoma and large cell undifferentiated cancer.",
            "Adenocarci- nomas, accounting for a minor proportion of this excess risk, have been shown to be weakly, if at all, related to cigarette smoking (14,(20)(21)(22)",
            "Large cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung is the only major histologic type that has appeared to be unrelated to cigarette smoking.",
            "Thus, cigarette smoking was probably not a major confound- ing variable.",
            "However, the role of smoking as a promoter or cocarcinogen cannot be ruled out.",
            "Nev- ertheless, the conclusion of this phase of the inves- tigation was that an excess risk occurred among plant employees for types 3 and 4 lung cancer, especially type 4.",
            "The third objective was to test whether one or more particular chemicals used at the plant were responsible for either the excess risk of all lung cancer or of the types 3 and 4 or just type 4 lung cancer.",
            "The SAED model was specifically devel- oped for this objective.",
            "The major hypothesis was tested for each chemi- cal in the SAED model by using the one-sided t-test of the observed minus expected cumulative doses over all years before death and ten or more years before death (Table 8).",
            "PVC dust was the only chemical that was statistically significant.",
            "These results suggest that an excess of types 3 and 4 lung cancer exists at this plant and is related to PVC dust exposure.",
            "The suggestion of PVC dust being a lung carcin- ogen is biologically plausible.",
            "Almost all PVC parti- cles produced by the emulsion system, one of the systems at this plant, are in the respirable range (23).",
            "These particles could settle in the lungs and conceivably by themselves cause lung cancer.",
            "In fact, one case of supposedly PVC dust-induced pneu- moconiosis has been found in a worker (24), and pulmonary granulomas (25,26) have been induced in animals exposed to PVC dust.",
            "In a large proportional mortality study of 4341 deaths that occurred among PVC fabricators, persons expected to be exposed to VCM and PVC dust demonstrated a slight (PMR = 117) excess lung cancer risk (27).",
            "VCM gas is easily inhaled, and possibly would be in contact with tissue only a short time before being either exhaled or absorbed into the bloodstream.",
            "However, VCM becomes entrapped in the PVC dust and can be released slowly over time.",
            "Thus, PVC dust particles in the lung may slowly release VCM to small adjacent areas of the tissue, prolonging the contact time of that chemical to tissue.",
            "If this latter hypothesis is true, then it begs the question of why almost all of the liver angiosarcoma cases occurred among polymer reactor cleaners who received extremely high VCM doses while the lung cancer cases occurred frequently among the less heavily exposed workers.",
            "In fact, there was no relationship between VCM and lung cancer in this analysis; yet, one would expect the lung to be the major route of entry for VCM regardless of the cancer site.",
            "bE = (45 A) -(45 B x 100/149)."

            "The uptake of VC by rats in vivo was inhibited by prior administration of ethanol (5), and in hepatocyte suspensions of rat liver, 4 mM ethanol inhibited VC metabolism 50% (6).",

            "Food and water were withdrawn during VC inhalation and animals were held in compartmented stainless-steel holding-cages which were rotated in the chamber.",
            "Temperature in the 60 ft3 chamber ranged from 70 to 75\u00b0F, air flow was 15 ft3/min and humidity -50%.",
            "The chamber effluent was mixed with natural gas and incinerated at 600-700\u00b0C; the incinerator effluent was cooled and scrubbed of HCI with water.",
            "VC (purity 99.9%, Matheson Gas Products) was metered into filtered air prior to entering the chamber.",

            "After 18 months the difference between exposed and control rats was about 9%.",
            "There was a more pronounced effect on the survival of exposed animals.",
            "At 18 months, survival was 40% in VC exposed and 18% in VC-ethanol exposed animals in contrast to groups inhaling filtered air in which 70% of the animals ingesting a normal diet and 73% receiving 5% ethanol survived at 18 months.",
            "The decreased survival in VC-exposed groups was due to the development of pathological lesions induced by VC or VC-ethanol rather than to nonspecific causes such as murine pneumonia.",
            "Angiosarcomas and hepatocellular carcinomas were seen in the liver of rats inhaling VC (Table 2).",
            "In some cases, more than one angiosarcoma or carci- noma developed in an animal; the incidence re- ported in Table 2 represents the type of lesion per rat rather than the total number of liver lesions.",
            "The first deaths from angiosarcoma occurred in a VC-ethanol animal at 9 months and at 12 months in a rat exposed to VC alone.",
            "The incidence of angiosarcoma of the liver was increased from 23% (VC alone) to 50% in VC-ethanol exposed rats.",
            "Ethanol had a similar effect on the induction of hepatocellular carcinoma by VC; 44% developed the neoplasm from VC inhalation, and 60% developed the carcinoma from treatment with both agents.",
            "Angiosarcoma of the liver was not found in either filtered air group; however, hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in 10% of the ethanol-ingesting and in 1% of untreated animals.",

            "The incidence of pituitary adenomas in untreated animals suggests that these rats were unusually susceptible to this lesion.",
            "It appeared that VC had no influence on the development of pancreatic adenomas which consisted mostly of beta cells.",
            "The total number of endocrine tumors in each group indicates a strong effect of ethanol on the endocrine system.",

            "The Sprague-Dawley rats used by Maltoni and Lefemine in 1974 (4) were more resistant to the effects of VC on the liver than the animals used in this VC-ethanol study.",
            "Following a year-long exposure to 500 ppm VC 4 hr/day, 5 days/week and observation from first VC exposure for 135 weeks, only 7 of 59 rats (12%) were reported to have angiosarcoma in the liver (4).",
            "Angiosarcomas de- veloped in other sites such as in subcutaneous tissue, the abdominal cavity, neck, lung and uterus.",
            "Hepatocellular carcinomas were not reported.",
            "Zymbal gland carcinomas were seen in 8% of Maltoni's VC exposed animals; none were seen in this study.",
            "Ethanol has been reported to potentiate the toxicity of other halogenated hydrocarbons.",
            "In whole animals, a variety of alcohols increased the hepatotoxicity of carbon tetrachloride (CC14) when ingested 16 to 18 hr prior to inhalation of CC14 (7).",
            "Following acute exposures, CC14 toxicity was en- hanced by ethanol as judged by the elevation of serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase levels.",
            "In similar studies, trichloroethylene (TCE) or 1,1,1- trichloroethane hepatotoxicity was potentiated by ethanol, but only at high concentrations of inhaled TCE or 1,1,1-trichloroethane (8).",
            "Ethanol potentiation of VC carcinogenesis in the liver is probably due to an effect on VC metabolism.",
            "Inhibition of VC uptake (5) and metabolism (6) by ethanol suggests there is a shared step in the oxidation of the two toxic agents.",
            "The most likely candidates for competition are acetaldehyde and chloroacetaldehyde.",

            "Results of the present study also are consistent with other earlier studies in Seattle showing that hospitalizations for asthma as well as increases in asthma symptoms and increased use of rescue medications are associated with fine particles in Seattle.",
            "Our data suggest that exposure to PM10 may play an important role in asthma exacerbation.",
            "This significant association between FENO and PM10 was not surprising, especially for subjects with asthma that have narrowed airways, as the thoracic coarse particles deposit preferentially in the larger bronchial airways and these airways may be the ones with the greatest inflammation potential.",
            "The observed association is supported by studies that have linked PM10 to pulmonary inflammation in animal models and the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase in human bronchial epithelial cells.",

            "In contrast, no increase in FENO was seen in adult subjects with asthma after exposure to concentrated coarse particles or ultrafine particles.",
            "Several controlled ozone exposure studies have assessed FENO in atopic subjects with asthma and healthy subjects, but none has found an association.",
            "We found that FENO was associated with PM air pollution in study participants with asthma but not those with COPD.",
            "It is interesting that five of the seven subjects with asthma were using inhaled corticosteroids, which has been associated with mitigation of eNO in air pollution studies and clinical settings.",

            "Exhaled NO in stable COPD has been found to be lower than in nonsmoking asthmatics, but patients with unstable COPD have higher NO levels than ex-smokers with COPD.",
            "BC may more closely identify the sources of PM than standard measures of mass concentration.",
            "The contribution of BC to total PM varies geographically and temporally due to the distribution of the combustion sources that produce BC.",

            "Recent source apportionment studies in Seattle found that burning vegetation and mobile sources are major contributors to PM2.5 and that burning vegetation is the dominant contributor to variations in the day-to-day BC in the winter.",
            "Burning vegetation, and to a lesser extent, mobile sources, may therefore be responsible for the observed increases in FENO associated with BC.",
            "It is somewhat surprising that we did not find an association between standard spirometry measures and association with PM2.5, PM10, and BC.",
            "An earlier study completed in Seattle during the wood-burning season showed that spirometry, specifically FVC and FEV1, decreased in association with increases in particulate matter air pollution in children with asthma.",

            "This is in contrast to studies that have reported increases in blood pressure and pulse rate with exposure to PM.",
            "Our study results are consistent with those of a larger panel study in Seattle, but that study did see minor decreases in pulse rate in healthy subjects.",
            "Yet another study did find some changes in ectopic beats in subjects with COPD.",
            "To our knowledge the present study is the first air pollution study simultaneously exploring FENO, spirometry, and cardiac outcomes.",
            "It appears that FENO is more sensitive to changes in PM2.5, PM10, and BC than the other outcomes.",
            "This finding emphasizes the importance of including noninvasive, sensitive measures of health outcomes in panel studies.",
            "The intensive monitoring of health effects and PM metrics in this study of susceptible individuals provides better estimates of actual exposures than epidemiologic data based on PM2.5 at a central site.",
            "There are, however, several limitations to this study.",
            "Relatively small numbers of subjects in each patient group (asthma, COPD, and those diagnosed with asthma and COPD) were monitored due to time constraints and technician availability.",
            "The same constraints also limited our ability to collect replicate NO measurements at a single time point.",
            "Subjects with COPD have difficulty performing spirometry.",
            "Also, relatively low ambient PM concentrations were experienced during the study period.",
            "That there were weaker associations between FENO and personal PM or BC may be explained by small sample air volumes, especially for the 4 L/minute personal PM10 samples, and the higher relative measurement error for these samples.",
            "In conclusion, these data implicate combustion-derived PM, as measured by light absorption coefficient primarily from wood burning, as being associated with airway inflammation in adult subjects with asthma.",
            "Further, these data support the fact that FENO is a relatively simple, noninvasive measure to explore the mechanisms responsible for respiratory effects in air pollution epidemiologic field studies.",

            "Ingredients in manual metal arc welding fumes from stainless steel may not be mutagenic in man.",
            "The workroom exposure to mutagenic agent(s) may be too low, or there may be an insufficient distribution of mutagen(s) to t h e lymphocytes, eg, d u e to retention in the lungs (2,13,16) or to metabolic inactivation of mutagen(s) or t o a mopping u p of chromium by the red blood cells (6, 17).",
            "I n addition, mutagenic agent(s) may reach t h e lymphocytes but for some reason do not generate cytogenetic damage in this type of cell, or cytogenetically damaged lymphocytes may be efficiently eliminated from the blood stream.",
            "The lack of cytogenetic damage in lymphocytes could, however, still b e in accordance with a mutagenic/ carcinogenic effect in the lungs or other organs.",

            "Bonser, Clayson, Jull and Pyrah examined the carcinogenic action of 2-naphthylamine (I) and the hydrochloride of one of its metabolites, namely, 2-amino-1-naphthol (II), by means of the implantation of paraffin wax pellets containing the chemicals into the lumen of the mouse bladder.",
            "On the basis of experiments on forty-two mice they concluded that whereas the parent amine, 2-naphthylamine, was not active under these conditions the metabolite, 2-amino- 1-naphthol was carcinogenic.",
            "The carcinogenicity of 2-amino-l-naphthol and the absence of such activity with 2-naphthylamine led Clayson (1953) to suggest that aromatic amines and",
            "certain other compounds were carcinogenic because of their conversion in the animal body to ortho hydroxy-amines.",
            "As a first step in testing this hypothesis it was necessary to show that ortho hydroxy-amines are in fact carcinogenic.",
            "It has recently been shown that 4-aminodiphenyl (para-xenylamine, VII)    carcinogen (Melick, Escue, Naryka, Mezera and Wheeler, 1955): it rapidly induces tumours in the dog (Walpole, Williams and Roberts, 1954: Deichmann,  Coplan, Woods, Anderson, Heslin and Radomski, 1956): and it is relatively slow acting in the rat (Walpole, Williams and Roberts, 1952).",
            "In the dog 4-amino- diphenyl is excreted into the urine as 4-amino-3-diphenylyl hydrogen sulphate (IX), (Bradshaw and Clayson, 1955), and Bradshaw (unpublished observation)  has shown that free 3-hydroxy-4-aminodiphenyl (VIII) is present in low concentra- tion in the urine of dogs receiving the chemical.",
            "Kirby and Peacock (1949)   found that the erstwhile food colorant 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol (Oil orange E) (V) induced-hepatomas in 7 of 24 mice surviving to a significant age and it was suggested (Clayson, 1953) that the activity of this compound might be due to its rcduction in the body to 1-amino-2-naphthol (VI).",
            "The purpose of the present experiments was to confirm the results previously obtained with 2-amino-1-naphthol and 2-naphthylamine and to see if they can be extended to 4-aminodiphenyl and 3-hydroxy-4-aminodiphenyl, and to 1- phenylazo-2-naphthol and 1-amino-2-naphthol.",

            "605 mice survived longer than 25 weeks and of these 45 (7'4 per cent) were killed on account of failing health between 25 and 30 weeks, 38 (6'3 per cent) between 31 and 35 weeks, 44 (7'3 per cent) between 36 and 40 weeks, while 478 (79 per cent) were killed at 40 weeks.",

            "From Table IV it will be seen that whereas the compound prepared by Method A (9/40-22.5 per cent) and by Method B (7/43-16.3 per cent) induced significantly more tumours than did the controls, the compound prepared by Method C (4/35--115 per cent) did not.",
            "It is possible that this paradoxical result may be explained by the small numbers involved in these experiments, as the deficiency in the group treated with 2-amino-1-naphthol prepared by Method C is of two tumours only.",

            "Alternative]y, application of the X2 test to the incidence of tumours with 2-amino-1-naphthol hydrochloride shows that such a distribution between the three groups might well occur by chance in experiments of this nature (X2 1-7, n = 2, P-0.45).",
            "Alteration of the 2- amino-l-naphthol molecule by substitution on the oxygen atom as in 2-amino-1- naphthyl hydrogen sulphate (III) (2/38-5.3 per cent) or on both oxygen and nitrogen atoms as in 2-dimethyl-amino-l-methoxynaphthalene hydrochloride (IV) (2/33-6.1 per cent) suppressed the carcinogenic activity.",

            "A preliminary group of twenty mice implanted with pellets containing 4'-nitro-4-amino-3-hydroxydiphenyl hydrochloride (X) yielded three well established and invasive carcinomas (15 per cent).",
            "Thus, this compound is apparently carcinogenic.",
            "DISCUSSION.",
            "The present experiments confirm the value of the technique of the implantation of paraffin wax pellets containing suspected substances into the lumen of the bladder of the mouse as a test for carcinogenic activity.",
            "The chemicals tested fall into three groups; (i) the four ortho hydroxy-amines, 2-amino-1-naphthol hydro- chloride (II), 1-amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride (VI), 3-hydroxy-4-aminodiphenyl sulphate (VIII) and probably 4'-nitro-3-hydroxy-4-aminodiphenyl hydrochloride (X) and also the food colorant 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol (V) are carcinogenic; (ii) 2-amino-1-naphthyl hydrogen sulphate (III), 2-dimethylamino-1-methoxynaph- thalene hydrochloride (IV), and 4-amino-3-diphenylyl sodium sulphate (IX) are inactive, while (iii) 2-naphthylamine (I) and possibly 4-aminodiphenyl (VII) occupy an intermediate position.",
            "The occurrence of tumours with paraffin wax alone may be due to the presence of a foreign body in the mouse bladder or to a low degree of carcinogenic activity in the wax used.",
            "The latter seems possible as Pullinger (personal communication)   has implanted pellets of another batch of wax with and without added material into the bladders of mice and has only obtained one papilloma in 37 mice surviving 25-106 weeks.",
            "As in the present experiments the incidence of tumours with the paraffin wax was 3.5 per cent, and with the ortho hydroxyamines was only 15-30 per cent, groups of not less than thirty mice were necessary to give a significant yield of tumours.",
            "Groups of 200-250 mice would be necessary to establish the significance of the results with 2-naphthylamine and 4-aminodiphenyl, with which the tumour incidence was only about 8 per cent.",
            "The tumours obtained with 2-naphthylamine are not likely to be due to an impurity in the chemical as the incidence of tumours on implantation with 2-naph- thylamine purified by distillation and recrystallisation (Bonser, 1943) and by gradient sublimation (Henson et al., 1954) are similar.",
            "Bonser, Clayson, Jull, and  Pyrah (1956) showed that when 2-naphthylamine was allowed to stand in oily solution it slowly developed the ability to induce sarcomas when injected sub- cutaneously into mice.",
            "It is probable that a similar mechanism would account for the 2-naphthylamine tumours in the present experiments.",
            "Demonstration of the carcinogenic activity of the ortho hydroxy-amines 2-amino-l-naphthol, 1-amino-2-naphthol and 3-hydroxy-4-aminodiphenyl under the conditions of bladder implantation strongly supports the hypothesis that aromatic amines induce cancer by virtue of their transformation in the body to ortho hydroxy-amines.",
            "This activity may be due to (i) direct reaction of the ortho hydroxy-amines with the tissue constituents, (ii) conversion of the ortho-hydroxy- amines to the \"true carcinogens \" by the enzymes of the tissues, or (iii) conversion of the ortho hydroxy-amines to the \"true carcinogens\" chemically in the pellet or urine.",
            "Even ifthe latter mechanismis operative it is likely that the tracesoffree ortho hydroxy-amines now known to be present in the urine of animals treated with the aromatic amines, will undergo similar conversions.",
            "The explanation of the lack of activity of the tin complex of 2-amino-1-naphthol and the full activity of the similar complex of 1-amino-2-naphthol requires explanation.",
            "It has been shown that 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol (V) as well as 1-amino-2- naphthol hydrochloride is carcinogenic to the mouse bladder.",
            "It is possible that reduction of 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol takes place in the bladder epithelium.",
            "Ross  and Warwick (1955) have shown that a series of azo compounds are reduced by the xanthine-oxidase-xanthine system and this and similar enxymes are present in many tissues.",
            "The local biological activity of 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol has also been demonstrated by Green (personal communication) who has shown it to be a very active tumour inhibitor in rats, when applied by subcutaneous injection.",
            "It was originally suggested that 2-amino-1-naphthyl hydrogen sulphate might be broken down in the bladder to the ortho hydroxy-amine (Bonser et al., 1952).",
            "The lack of carcinogenic activity with the sulphate esters contraindicates this possibility, as does the observation of Boyland, Manson, Sims and Williams (1956) that some ortho aminophenyl hydrogen sulphates are not hydrolysed by known mammalian sulphatases.",
            "They suggest that free ortho hydroxy-amines are produced in the urine by the enzymic hydrolysis of the corresponding ortho aminophenyl glucuronides or phosphates.",
            "The results obtained by the bladder implantation method require confirmation by other methods.",
            "Conventional techniques such as painting and feeding are not likely to be reliable because of the easy oxidation of these compounds, and because an optimum concentration is required at the site of tumour induction.",
            "Subcu- taneous injection of 2-amino-l-naphthol hydrochloride (Bonser et al., 1952) produced a small yield of local sarcomas while Hueper (1938) obtained retro- thelial sarcomas in mice by intraperitoneal injection of the crude chemical.",
            "Recently Miller and Miller (1955) attempted to induce tumours in rats by feeding 4-acetamidodiphenyl, 3-hydroxy-4-acetamidodiphenyl and 3-hydroxy-4-amino- diphenyl to rats.",
            "They obtained a number of fibroadenomas of the breast during a period of twelve months, at which time they terminated the experiment.",
            "Similar lesions were also present in the controls.",
            "It is unfortunate that the experiment was terminated at so early a stage as Walpole et al.",
            "(1952) did not obtain tumours with 4-aminodiphenyl in rats until 570 days.",
            "The present results of testing ortho hydroxy-amines support the hypothesis that aromatic amines are carcinogenic by virtue of their conversion to ortho hydroxy-amines in the animal body.",
            "It follows therefore that compounds which may give rise to ortho hydroxy-amines tn vivo should be regarded as potentially hazardous and that they should not be allowed to come into contact with human beinags either in the course of their work or as additives to foodstuffs. SUMMARY",
            "1. Pellets of paraffin wax implanted into the lumen of the bladder of fifty- seven mice induced two carcinomas.",
            "2. Pellets of paraffin wax containing 2-amino-1-naphthol hydrochloride, 1-amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride, 3-hydroxy-4-aminodiphenyl sulphate and 1 -phenylazo-2-naphthol have been shown to be carcinogenic on implantation into the mouse bladder.",

            "On the contrary, significantly increased CYP concentrations in catechol + ascorbate and hydroquinone + ascorbate-treated microsomes suggested a CYP activation that increased its binding of carbon monoxide.",
            "A small, but significant protection of CYP against HQ and BQ by x-tocopherol indicated a possible role of SQ in their toxicity.",
            "The data indicate that the quinones damage CYP via their oxidative forms, i.e., that HQ is rather toxic via its SQ or BQ product, while reac- tive oxygen species or lipid peroxidation might have additional, but less important, toxic effects.",

            "The present results confirm previous indirect evidence (1) that BQ and SQ are responsible for the CYP destruction caused by HQ and BQ and show that neither OH radicals nor lipid peroxidation play a significant role in the quinone toxicity.",

            "There was no positivity for PV T-Ag in urothelial carcinomas from 20 non-transplant patients.",
            "Since 1990, 10 transplant recipients in our unit have developed urothelial carcinoma, and tumour tissue was available in eight recipients.",
            "Two patients were transplanted since the first case of PV nephropathy (PVN) was diagnosed in our unit in 2000 and both showed PV reactivation post-transplantation.",
            "In one of these patients, there was strong nuclear staining for PV T-Ag in tumour cells, with no staining of non-neoplastic urothelium.",

            "Its presence in all tumour cells in one patient transplanted in the PVN era might suggest a possible role in tumorigenesis in that case.",
            "Renal transplant recipients carry a three- to four-fold increased risk of urothelial carcinoma when compared with the general population, the cause of which is unknown.",
            "Infection with oncogenic viruses is one possible explanation, and BK virus (BKV) is a potential candidate virus.",
            "BKV, a polyoma virus (PV), was first identified in 1971, in a renal transplant recipient with ureteric stenosis.",
            "It infects 90% of the population during childhood and subsequently remains latent in the epithelium of the urinary tract.",
            "Urinary reactivation of the virus is seen in approximately 30% of renal transplant recipients receiving modern immunosuppressive protocols.",
            "Persistent high levels of urothelial reactivation are associated with an increased risk of infection of the renal tubules within the graft, resulting in PV nephropathy (PVN) that occurs in 3\u20135% of renal transplant recipients.",
            "This is a relatively recent phenomenon that was first described in 1995.",
            "The first patient with PVN in our unit in Oxford was diagnosed in 2000.",
            "Current potent immunosuppressive regimens, the combination of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in particular, have been implicated in the emergence of this complication.",
            "The polyoma viruses, including BKV, have transforming activity, although a role in human neoplasia is yet to be demonstrated.",

            "Typical intranuclear inclusions were not seen on H&E sections and there was no lymphocytic response to the PV-positive tumour cells, even following reduced immunosuppression for 6 weeks after diagnosis and before cystectomy.",
            "Patient 7 is a 40-year-old woman, who received a renal transplant in 2001.",
            "Her initial immunosuppression was ciclosporin, azathioprine and prednisolone.",
            "However, she suffered three early rejections: a Banff 97 type IA rejection at day 7 post-transplantation, treated with 3 days of pulse methylprednisolone; a Banff 97 type III rejection at 13 days post-transplantation, treated with antithymocyte globulin and a Banff 97 type IB rejection, diagnosed at 27 days post-transplantation.",
            "The latter was treated with a second 3-day course of pulse methylprednisolone, followed by switch of ciclosporin and azathioprine to tacrolimus and MMF.",
            "No urine cytology to detect PV reactivation was performed, but PVN was diagnosed retrospectively using IH for PV T-Ag in a renal biopsy performed for graft dysfunction at 2 years post-transplantation (Figure 2).",

            "reported a significant association between urine cytology suggestive of PV infection and subsequent diagnosis of bladder carcinoma.",
            "However, this study did not confirm PV positivity with IH and the urinary findings may have been secondary to early urothelial carcinoma.",
            "The distinction of BKV infection from urothelial malignancy can be very difficult on cytomorphology alone, as illustrated by a recent study and by case 8 in our series.",
            "In a case\u2013control study, found no association between prevalence or titres of anti-BKV antibodies and diagnosis of bladder cancer.",
            "A recent tissue-based study detected BKV DNA by PCR in only 5.5% of urothelial carcinomas, all of which were negative on IH for BKV T-Ag. Similarly, we found no evidence of PV T-Ag in urothelial carcinoma from 20 immunocompetent patients.",

            "The association of PV-positive urothelial carcinoma and PVN in these patients suggests that persistent or high levels of post-transplant urinary reactivation of BKV may have a pathogenic role in the development of urothelial carcinoma.",
            "Alternatively, it is possible that tumour cells are more susceptible to BKV infection than normal urothelium, as infection occurs primarily in proliferating cells, and that positivity is a consequence rather than cause of neoplastic transformation.",

            "Long-term follow-up of these patients is required to demonstrate an association between viral reactivation and subsequent tumour development, and thus confirm the potential oncogenic role of BKV."

            "In ACFs observed 115 days after the administration of 50 mg kg-' 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), crypt multip- licity [number of aberrant crypts (AC) per focus] was positively correlated (P<0.0001) with the reduction of goblet cells, and with luminal and nuclear alterations in the cells surrounding the lumen of the ACs.",
            "We studied mucin production in the unsectioned colon, demonstrating that ACFs producing sulphomucins (like the normal distal rat colon) were progressively reduced when ACF multiplicity increased, whereas ACFs containing sialomucins (correlated with an increased risk of colon cancer) or both sulphomucins and sialomucins increased with crypt multiplicity.",
            "We also studied ACFs in the colon and the occurrence of intestinal tumours in rats treated with azoxymethane (AOM; 64 mg kg-').",
            "A significant association was found (P = 0.04) between tumours and the presence of 'large' ACFs (AC/ACF> 14 crypts) and a borderline significant association (P = 0.057) between the presence of tumours and sialomucin-producing ACFs.",
            "We found no association between the number of ACFs, ACF multiplicity and the presence of tumours.",
            "Data from experimental animals and humans indicate that colon carcinogenesis is a multistep process in which subsequent preneoplastic lesions accumulate in some mucosa cells, leading finally to neoplastic transformation (Day, 1984; Mor- son et al., 1992).",
            "Recently, it has been reported that in the colon of rodents treated with specific colon carcinogens, single aberrant crypts (AC) or foci of aberrant crypts (ACFs) can be visualised at low magnification in the unsectioned colon stained with methylene blue (Bird, 1987).",
            "ACFs have also been described in the resected colonic mucosa of humans at high risk for colon cancer (Pretlow et al., 1991; Roncucci et al., 1991a), where they were interpreted as preneoplastic lesions.",
            "The study of preneoplastic lesions is very important since it allows investigations of the stepwise process leading to cancer.",
            "Moreover, preneoplastic lesions can be usesd as end points in studies of experiments carcinogenesis and as early risk indicators for humans.",
            "However, since the first descrip- tion of ACFs in the literature (Bird, 1987), some researchers have wondered whether ACFs may truly be considered preneoplastic lesions and they have tried to identify dysplastic characteristics (such as nuclear alterations and abnormal luminal structure) or molecular abnormalities (such as activa- tion of some oncogenes) in ACFs (McLellan et al., 1991a,b;  Roncucci et al., 1991b; Stopera and Bird, 1992; Stopera et  al., 1992; Vivona et al., 1993).",
            "The results of these studies indicate that some ACFs are indeed dysplastic lesions.",
            "How- ever, only a limited number of ACFs have been evaluated in the previous studies, and it is not yet clear whether all the ACFs that are observed in the methylene blue-stained colon possess dysplastic features.",
            "Nor is it clear whether ACFs can be considered a reliable end point in experimental colon carcinogenesis (Hardman et al., 1991; Bird and Pretlow,  1992; Dolara and Caderni, 1992).",
            "In fact, to use ACFs as predictor of cancer frequency in treated animals, different methods have been adopted to define the characteristics of ACFs to be correlated with carcinogenesis.",
            "In some studies the total number of ACFs or ACF crypt multiplicity have been used; in some others the numbers of 'large' ACFs were considered (Corpet et al.,  1990; Pretlow et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992; Magnuson et  al., 1993).",
            "Although in most studies large ACFs are con- sidered an indication of rapid growth, no consensus has thus far been reached on the most appropriate method of relating ACFs to carcinogenesis.",
            "To characterise further the pathology of ACFs and its correlation with carcinogenesis, we decided to study ACFs in the unsectioned colon of rats at different times after 1,2dimethylhydrazine (DMH) or azoxymethane (AOM) admin- istration.",
            "Accordingly, we determined in ACFs induced by these two carcinogens the number, multiplicity and some morphological alterations such as an abnormal luminal pat- tern, the reduction in goblet cells and the nuclear alteration in the cells surrounding the aberrant crypts.",
            "We were also interested in studying mucin production in ACFs observed in unsectioned colons.",
            "Previous investigations performed in his- tological sections have shown that apparently normal colonic mucosa from patients with colon cancer and dysplastic foci observed in the distal colon of carcinogen-treated rats (Filipe  and Branfoot, 1974; Filipe, 1975; Wargovich et al., 1983;  Sandforth et al., 1988) produce predominantly sialomucins instead of sulphomucins as the normal mucosa.",

            "Induction of ACFs by DMH and AOM",
            "ACFs were induced with two different experimental pro- tocols.",
            "In the first we used 8to 9-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (Morini, Italy).",
            "Animals were fed a diet based on the AIN 76 diet (American Institute of Nutri- tion, 1977), modified to contain a relatively high amount of fat (23% corn oil), 23% sucrose and 23% starch as source of carbohydrates (Caderni et al., 1991).",
            "The rats were treated twice p.o., 4 days apart, either with saline or with DMH (Sigma Chimica, Milan, Italy) at a dose of 25 mg kg-' body weight (total dose 50 mg kg-').",
            "Forty and 115 days after the first treatment with DMH the animals were sacrificed by decapitation under a light ether anaesthesia.",
            "Each group was composed of 16 saline-treated and 16 DMH-treated rats.",
            "In the second protocol we used male Sprague-Dawley rats (4-5 weeks old), fed a diet of the same composition as described above.",
            "One week after the beginning of the experi- mental diet rats were treated s.c. with AOM (Sigma Chimica) at a weekly dose of 8 mg kg-' body weight for 8 weeks (total dose 64 mg kg-').",
            "We had 60 AOM-treated and 15 saline- treated rats.",
            "Between 158 and 162 days after the first dose of AOM the animals were sacrificed by decapitation and ACFs and intestinal tumours were studied.",
            "Cancer histological types were evaluated on the basis of histotype, grading and pattern of growth according to Morson et al. (1992).",
            "In all the experiments rats were maintained at a constant environmental temperature of 22\u00b0C, with a 12 h light-dark cycle, according to internationally accepted ethical guidelines for the treatment of experimental animals (European Community, 1986).",
            "Determination of the number, multiplicity and morphological alterations of ACFs",
            "To visualise the ACFs induced by DMH or AOM treatments, we stained the unsectioned colon with methylene blue according to Bird (1987).",
            "For each rat we determined the number of ACFs in the entire colon and their multiplicity by counting the number of ACs forming each focus (AC/ ACF).",
            "Moreover, in the colon of the rats sacrificed 115 days after DMH, 20 ACFs were randomly chosen from each rat and evaluated for the following architectural and cytological characteristics: pattern of luminal outline of the ACs (referred to as 'luminal alteration'), nuclear alteration with appearance of pseudostratification of the nuclei in the cells surrounding the lumen (referred to as 'nuclear alteration') and reduction in the number of goblet cells.",
            "This evaluation was carried out on unsectioned colons stained with methylene blue (magnification 40 -100 x).",
            "To evaluate the luminal alteration of the ACs, each AC was graded as mildly altered if the luminal outline was enlarged and round, moderately altered if elliptical or severely altered if slit-like, irregular and cribriform.",
            "In the cytological analysis of the nuclear alteration each AC was graded as mildly, moderately or severely altered depending on whether the nuclei, which in normal cells constitute a single layer close to the bases of the cells, seemed to occupy less than 35%, 35-50% or more than 50% of the cell space (epithelium) respectively.",
            "In the analysis of the reduction of goblet cells each AC was graded as mildly, moderately or severely altered depending on whether the reduction in the number of goblet cells was, respectively, less than 10%, 10-50% or more than 50% compared with those surrounding the normal crypts.",
            "To each grade of morphological alteration we arbitrarily attributed the value of 1, 2 or 3 (for mild, moderate and severe altera- tion respectively).",
            "Finally, the overall grade of ACF altera- tion was calculated by summing these values for each AC forming the focus and then dividing this value by the number of ACs in that focus.",
            "Determination of mucus production in the ACFs",
            "After the determination of the number of multiplicity of the ACFs using the methylene blue staining method, the colons were kept in buffered formalin and later processed with the high-iron diamine Alcian blue (HID-AB) procedure for the analysis of mucus production (Filipe, 1975).",
            "Briefly, the entire colon was rinsed for 5 min in distilled water and then transferred into a Petri dish containing a freshly prepared solution, referred to as diamine solution, obtained by dissolv- ing simultaneously 120 mg of N-N'-dimethyl-m-phenylene diamine and 20mg of N-N'-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine (Sigma Chimica) in 50 ml of distilled water and then adding 1.4 ml of 60% ferric chloride.",
            "The Petri dish was covered with aluminium foil for protection against the light and the colon was stained by the diamine solution for 18 h at room temperature.",
            "The colon was then rinsed three times in dis- tilled water and stained for 30 min with a solution of 1%",
            "Alcian blue (Sigma Chimica) in 3% acetic acid.",
            "The colon was then rinsed three times with 80% ethanol followed by distilled water and observed under the microscope with the mucosal side up at a magnification of 40 x.",
            "As a result of this procedure the cells surrounding the opening of the crypts in the distal part of the colon were stained dark brown, indicating a predominance of sulphomucin secretion.",
            "Moving from the distal to the proximal part of the colon the cells surrounding the opening of the crypts became increasingly blue, indicating a predominance of sialomucin secretion.",
            "This shift from sulphomucin to sialomucin production along the length of the rat colon, going towards the proximal part, has been previously described in histological sections (Filipe, 1975).",
            "We examined only the distal part of the rat colons since the distal colon shows a pattern of mucus production similar to that of the normal human colorectal mucosa in which sulphomucin secretion predominates and since precancerous alterations in the human and distal rat colon are accom- panied by a shift from sulphomucin to sialomucin secretion (Filipe and Branfoot, 1974; Filipe, 1975).",
            "The examination of DMH-treated rats showed that after the HID-AB procedure the ACFs were stained either dark brown, like the normal surrounding crypts (in which sulphomucin production predominates), or blue (in which sialomucin production predominates; Figure la), or both brown and blue together (in which sulphomucins and sialomucins were present together; Figure lb).",
            "The dark-brown ACFs were easily dis- tinguished from the normal crypts, being larger and with a thicker epithelial lining; the blue and blue-brown ACFs, besides the morphological characteristics pertaining to these lesions (Bird, 1987), were easily identified against the back- ground of normal brown crypts (Figure la andb).",
            "The number of ACFs and their multiplicity (AC/ACF) scored with the methylene blue and with HID-AB technique were significantly correlated (r= 0.88 and 0.96 for the number of ACFs and AC/ACF respectively).",
            "Statistical analysis of the data Differences between means were evaluated using Student's t-test for unpaired samples; the correlations between the alterations of the morphological parameters and the multiplicity of ACFs were analysed by a linear regression model using Statgraphics Statistical Package (Statistical Graphic Corporation, Rockville, MD, USA).",
            "To establish whether an ACF parameter would relate to tumour incidence in carcinogen-treated rats, we evaluated the probability of bearing a tumour as a function of each of the different parameters of ACFs analysed, by means of a logistic regression model in which the binary response was bearing or not bearing a tumour.",
            "For each parameter, the regression coefficient is an estimate of this association.",
            "The odds ratio (OR) of each parameter is calculated as eregresson coeffcient = OR; the corresponding 95% confidejce limits (CLs) are obtained from the model fitting.",
            "The association is considered statis- tically significant when the 95% CLs do not include the value of 1 (Rothman, 1986).",
            "The association between the distribution of mucin production and bearing or not bearing a tumour was evaluated according to the generalised estimating equation (GEE) (Liang and Zeger, 1986), which is based on a logistic regres- sion model.",
            "From this analysis we calculated odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% CLs as described above.",
            "The application of GEE is appropriate when there is a correlation among observations.",
            "In fact, within the same rat, three measurements were determined: the number of sulphomucin-producing ACFs, the number of ACFs produc- ing sulphoand sialomucins and the number of ACFs pro- ducing sialomucins.",
            "These measurements are correlated with each other (r = 0.45), in the same rat (cluster).",
            "Therefore, the dependence among observations from the same cluster (rat) must be accounted for in assessing the relationship between the different risk factors and tumour outcome.",

            "We studied ACFs in the colons of rats treated twice, 4 days apart, with 25 mg kg-' DMH or saline and sacrificed 40 and 115 days after DMH administration.",
            "The colon was first stained with methylene blue as described and the number of multiplicity of ACFs were determined.",
            "The results indicated that the number of ACFs was similar in the rats sacrificed 40 or 115 days after DMH administration (82.5 \u00b1 13.8 and 85.2 + 10.2, means \u00b1 s.e.).",
            "As expected, the results also indicated that the multiplicity of ACFs (number of ACs/ ACF) was lower in rats sacrificed 40 days after DMH (1.78\u00b10.05) than in rats sacrificed 115 days after (2.92\u00b1 0.17, means \u00b1 s.e., P < 0.001).",
            "No ACFs were found in the colon of saline-treated rats.",
            "We then evaluated 20 ACFs randomly chosen in each rat sacrificed 115 days after DMH (total number of ACFs analysed = 313 -312) for the following morphological char- acteristics: nuclear alteration in the cells surrounding the lumen of the ACs, luminal alteration and reduction in the number of goblet cells as described in Materials and methods.",
            "This evaluation was carried out by observing these parameters in the unsectioned colon, since with this topo- graphical approach it was possible to study more lesions than in histological sections.",
            "Each AC or ACF was graded as having mild, moderate or severe alterations as described in the Materials and methods section.",
            "The results indicated (Table I) that most ACs had mild or moderate alterations and only a few showed severe nuclear alteration and goblet cell reduction.",
            "We also determined the grades of morphological alterations in ACFs as a function of their multiplicity (AC/ACF).",
            "The results indicated (Figure 2a-c) that crypt multiplicity was positively correlated with the severity of all the morphological altera- tions analysed (luminal alteration, goblet cell reduction and nuclear alteration in the cells surrounding the lumen of the crypt).",
            "We also studied the type of mucus produced by the ACFs.",
            "The distal colon of each rat treated with DMH and sacrificed 40 and 115 days later was therefore stained with the HID-AB technique and the number and multipliciiy of the ACFs and type of mucus secreted were recorded.",
            "The results relative to the rats sacrificed 115 days after DMH (Table II) indicated that some of the ACFs still retained the sulphomucin secre- tion typical of the normal mucosa but that most ACFs secreted both sulphoand sialomucins.",
            "A smaller fraction of ACFs secreted only sialomucins.",
            "Similarly, 40 days after the carcinogen treatment, most ACFs secreted sulphoand sialomucins (data not shown).",
            "We calculated the correlation between the type of mucin produced by the ACFs and ACF multiplicity.",
            "The results relative to ACFs observed 115 days after DMH indicated (Figure 2d) that, when ACF multiplicity increased, the percentage of ACFs producing sulphomucins decreased rapidly, while the percentage of ACFs containing both sulphomucins and sialomucins progressively increased.",
            "A few ACFs composed entirely of sialomucins were also observed in ACFs formed by few crypts, and their number slowly increased with the increase in ACF muliplicity.",
            "The ACFs observed in rats sacrificed 40 days after DMH showed a similar correlation between mucin production and crypt multiplicity (data not shown).",
            "Characterisation of ACFs determined 160 days after AOM administration in rats with and without tumours Rats were treated with 8 mg kg-' AOM weekly for 8 weeks and sacrificed 158-162 days after the first injection with AOM.",

            "The results of histopathological examination of the whole intestine (Table III) indicated that the majority of tumours (both adenocar- cinomas and adenomas) were induced in the colon, and only a few were found in the small intestine.",
            "The control rats treated with saline did not develop tumours.",
            "Since we were interested in studying the ACFs also when tumours were evident, after excision of the tumours for histopathology, the whole colon, fixed in buffered formalin, was stained with methylene blue in order to determine the number and crypt multiplicity of the ACFs.",

            "Discussion",
            "In recent years several laboratories have been using ACFs as an end point in short-term tests for predicting colon car- cinogenesis in rodents (Tudek et al., 1989; Corpet et al.,  1990; Pretlow et al., 1990; Zhang et al., 1992).",
            "ACFs are easily scored in the unsectioned colon of carcinogen-treated animals, and they develop as early as 2-4 weeks after car- cinogen administration.",
            "Moreover, the ACF assay requires a relatively small number of animals and a short experimental time as compared with long-term carcinogenesis studies.",
            "Therefore this assay has attained considerable popularity as a short-term test for the study of the modulating effects of chemicals and/or dietary factors on experimental colon car- cinogenesis.",
            "Notwithstanding the merits of the ACF assay, the relation- ship between ACFs and carcinogenesis seems to be rather complicated.",
            "It is certain that colon carcinogens induce ACFs dose dependently and that the number of ACFs is correlated with the potency of the carcinogen (Tudek et al., 1993).",
            "However, some authors (Hardman et al., 1991) have not observed an association between the incidence of colon cancer and ACF number or size, and most others do not use the same parameters to describe the association of ACFs with carcinogenesis.",
            "Some authors stress the importance of ACF multiplicity (AC/ACF) (Magnuson et al., 1993), while others favour the number of 'large' ACFs, but they calculate 'large' ACFs using different criteria (Corpet et al., 1990;  Pretlow et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992).",
            "Given the current undetermined relationship between ACFs and carcinogenesis, the validity of the ACF assay has been questioned (Hardman et al., 1991; Magnuson et al.,   1993) and the possibility has been raised that ACFs are elementary lesions, only a few of which are truly preneoplastic.",
            "Some authors have also studied genetic lesions which occur in colon adenomas and carcinomas in ACFs.",
            "Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that a small subpopulation of ACFs have increased expression and activation of the ras oncogene (Stopera and Bird, 1992; Stopera et al., 1992; Vivona et al.,  1993).",
            "Other studies have focused on ACF dysplasia, with the aim of identifying the actual dysplastic lesions within the ACF population (McLellan et al., 1991b; Roncucci et al.,  1991b).",
            "The limitation of these studies is that only a small",
            "In the present paper we try to identify and quantify a series of morphological alterations in ACFs observed in whole unsectioned colons with the same topographical approach used for the determination of ACFs with the methylene blue staining technique.",
            "We performed two sets of experiments, one in which ACFs were induced by DMH and a second one involving AOM, a metabolite of DMH cur- rently used in colon carcinogenesis studies.",
            "We observed some morphological alterations (nuclear and luminal alterations and goblet cell reduction) in a relatively large number of ACFs (about 300).",
            "Usually the evaluation of morphological alterations in a tissue is carried out on histological sections, in which various morphological aspects of dysplasia are determined (Morson  et al., 1992).",
            "In the present study, we attempted to identify morphological alterations, similar to those characterising dysplasia, in unsectioned specimens; in fact, the differential staining of ACFs with methylene blue is in itself a sign of altered cellular and tissue structures.",
            "The alterations that we observed in the ACFs are relatively modest, although they seem to be similar to the dysplastic alterations observed in histological specimens of adenomas or microadenomas.",
            "In these lesions, the cytoarchitectural alterations and dysplastic characteristics are usually more evident and severe than those observed in ACFS, due partially to a larger size of adenomas or microadenomas.",
            "In fact, if the same criteria used to graduate dysplasia in adenomas are applied to ACFs, the majority of ACFs would be graded as having mild or moderate morphological alterations.",
            "We find that luminal alteration, goblet cell reduction and nuclear alterations of the cells surrounding the lumen of the crypt are correlated with increased multiplicity of ACFs.",
            "These results suggest that the growth of at least some ACFs (as assessed by increased ACF multiplicity) is accompanied by acquisition of dysplastic features typical of precancerous lesions.",
            "We demonstrate that it is possible to study mucin production by ACFs, determining sulpho-and sialomucins in whole unsectioned distal colons stained with the HID-AB tech- nique.",
            "We can detect ACFs with the HID-AB technique as well as with methylene blue staining, as demonstrated by the highly significant correlation between the number of ACFs per colon and multiplicity using the two methods.",
            "ACFs secreting only sulphomucins are progressively reduced in number as crypt multiplicity increases.",
            "On the other hand, ACFs containing both sulpho-and sialomucins progressively increase as does crypt multiplicity.",
            "A progression from sul- phomucin to sialomucin production has been described in colon microadenomas and dysplastic foci in histological sec- tions of the colon of DMH-treated rats, and it has been suggested that this mucin alteration occurs early in colon carcinogenesis (Filipe, 1975;Wargovich et al., 1983;Sand- forth et al., 1988).",
            "Therefore, similarly to what is observed for the morphological alterations, these results suggest that most ACFs, when growing, tend to lose the characteristics of normal mucosa, gaining those of preneoplastic lesions.",
            "We attempted to study the association between carcinogenesis and ACFs by examining the different parameters of ACFs in tumour-bearing and tumour-free rats.",
            "Therefore, we evaluated the probability of bearing a tumour as a function of each of the different parameters of ACFs analysed using a logistic regression model.",
            "The results of this effort demonstrate, in agreement with previous results (Hardman et  al., 1991; Magnuson et al., 1993), that there is no association between the total number of ACFs or their multiplicity and the presence of tumour in the animal.",
            "We observed that tumour-free animals had the same number and multiplicity of ACFs as those bearing tumours.",
            "On the other hand, we found that the tumour-free rats have significantly fewer 'large' ACFs (> 14 AC/ACF) than tumour-bearing rats and that the probability of bearing a tumour in relation to the presence of large ACFs is statistically significant (P= 0.04).",
            "Our results show a borderline significant association (P = 0.057) between the presence of sialomucin-producing ACFs and the probability of bearing a tumour, sialomucins being more represented in the ACFs of tumour-bearing animals than in those of tumour-free rats.",
            "On the basis of our results, we suggest that the best parameter for studying the association between carcinogenesis and ACF is the number of 'large' ACFs and the presence of sialomucin-producing ACFs.",
            "It is not yet clear if the ACFs that have an abnormal secretion of sialomucin and large dimensions are the same as those which accumulate genetic damage relevant for cancer developement.",
            "Most previous genetic studies with this model were carried out on small populations of ACFs, and the association between size and expression of genetic damage was not studied.",
            "It would be useful if protocols could be developed to screen the ACFs in whole colon with molecular biological methods.",
            "In the meantime an improvement in the performance of the ACF assay might be possible, by classifying ACFs using these two simple morphological parameters (number of large ACFs and sialomucin production).",

            "The clearest evidence of impairment following the intoxication was observed in the Brown-Peterson task.",
            "Overall levels of performance in the serial position and paired-associate tasks were, however, also slightly impaired.",
            "A six-month follow-up showed no relative recovery.",
            "Free-recall in the serial position task conformed to the classic pattern found for normal subjects (5,9).",
            "Recall was good for the first word (primary effect) and last few words (recency effect) of each list and uniformly poor for middle-list items (the asymptote).",
            "The recency effect reflects recall from a limited capacity, highly accessible, labile short-term memory system, while the asymptote reflects recall from a longer-term memory system.",
            "Although the level of performance by the acute group was inferior, the form of the serial position curve was identical for the acute, chronic, and reference groups.",
            "It can be concluded, therefore, that neither short-term (primary) nor longer-term (secondary) memory systems were specifically implicated in the inferior recall.",
            "Similarly ,although the acute group recalled fewer paired associates, they learned the associates at the same rate as the chronic and reference groups.",
            "By contrast, in the Brown-Peterson task, the acute group showed impaired resistance to the competing influence of a distractor task.",
            "While this finding provides some support for the intoxicated workers' complaints of impaired memory, two aspects of the data implied that the more rapid loss of information from short-term memory was not the result of simple decay.",
            "First, after the initial disruption, forgetting was substantial but equivalent for the three groups.",
            "Second, there was no reduced recency effect in the serial position task.",
            "Thus other task factors were implicated in the impaired Brown-Peterson performance.",
            "These factors are considered in the following discussion.",
            "In addition to simple decay (3), vulnerability to proactive and retroactive interference (7,12) , and the alIocation of processing resources between memory and interval tasks (8), ca n also influence forgetting rates in sho rt-term memory ta sks.",
            "Interference from previous trials (proacti ve interference) is a known source of for getting in Brown-Peterson ta sks and was, therefore, specifically equated at each dela y condition .",
            "The data from the serial po sition ta sk allowed examination of proactive interference effects, but the acute group was not more susceptible to proacti ve interference.",
            "In the Brown-Peterson ta sk , interference from material processed after learn ing (retroactive interference) derives from the interval ta sk (ba ckward counting).",
            "However, because the forgetting rates of the acute, chronic, and reference groups were equivalent after the initial disruption, it can be concluded that the acute group was not more susceptible to retroactive interference .",
            "From the preceding discu ssion, it can be concluded that the specific difficulty of the intoxicated workers appears to be one of initially allocating processing reso urces to both memory and co un ting tasks -that is, the acute group was more easil y disrupted by another attention demanding ta sk .",
            "Because the processing requirements of the interva l ta sk have a substantial effe ct on forgetting rates (8), it is important to note that there was no evidence that the acute gro up foun d the counting task more difficult.",
            "In connection with the effects of interval ta sk difficult y on Brown-Peterson recall , Morris (8) ha s described several techniques for studying central processing reductions of the kind found in the present study.",
            "Depression and reduced \"freedom from distractibility\" have often been described as sympto ms of organic solvent exposure (1 , 13), and the present find ings suppo rt this possibility for the intoxicated workers.",
            "The magnitude of the memory sequelae was not correlated with the depression scores, a finding suggesting that cognitive impairment may occur independently of mood change.",
            "The possibility that preexisting group differences confounded this interpretation was considered unlikely.",
            "First, although the acute group compri sed solvent workers severely a ffected in the accident, selection was based on case histo ry and clinical criteria , not psychological cr iteria.",
            "Second, th e po ssibility that workers with initialIy \" poore r memory\" were d isproportionately represented in the ac ute group also seems unlikely given that the patterns of memory performance were identical for the acute, chronic, and reference gro ups -with the exception of the specific impairment found in the Brown-Peterson ta sk.",
            "In summary, the present study found that the memory sequelae of solvent intoxication refle cted difficulty with initiall y allocating central processing resourc es, a difficulty which was still apparent some eight months after the intoxication.",
            "The extent to which poor recalI in the paired-associate and serial position tasks was also 48 du e to a general restriction in central processing capacity, however , remains unknown .",
            "Th ese find ings go some way towards clarifying the clinical picture of solvent into xication and, becau se information retention in situations which prevent immediate rehearsal captures a common memory experience, it is sugge sted that difficulties in resource a llocation may also be the basis of memory complaints of other occupationally exposed populations.",
            "The poor prognosis for the intoxicated workers should be treated with caut ion when recovery from other solvent into xications is being estimated because the contribution of chro nic so lvent exposure to the nature of the memory sequelae could not be adequately explored in such a small population of industrially intoxicated workers .",
            "Final-Iy, it is suggested that memory tasks covering a similar range of functions should prove useful in identifying memory impairment in other occupationally exposed groups, not the least because they help to specify the nature of memory difficulties .",

            "Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a relatively uncommon but highly lethal form of skin cancer.",
            "A majority of MCC tumors carry DNA sequences derived from a newly identified virus called Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV or MCPyV), a candidate etiologic agent underlying the development of MCC.",
            "To further investigate the role of MCV infection in the development of MCC, we developed a reporter vector-based neutralization assay to quantitate MCV-specific serum antibody responses in human subjects.",
            "Our results showed that 21 MCC patients whose tumors harbored MCV DNA all displayed vigorous MCV-specific antibody responses.",
            "Although 88% (42/48) of adult subjects without MCC were MCV seropositive, the geometric mean titer of the control group was 59-fold lower than the MCC patient group (p<0.0001).",
            "Only 4% (2/48) of control subjects displayed neutralizing titers greater than the mean titer of the MCV-positive MCC patient population.",
            "MCC tumors were found not to express detectable amounts of MCV VP1 capsid protein, suggesting that the strong humoral responses observed in MCC patients were primed by an unusually immunogenic MCV infection, and not by viral antigen expressed by the MCC tumor itself.",
            "The occurrence of highly immunogenic MCV infection in MCC patients is unlikely to reflect a failure to control polyomavirus infections in general, as seroreactivity to BK polyomavirus was similar among MCC patients and control subjects.",
            "The results support the concept that MCV infection is a causative factor in the development of most cases of MCC.",
            "Although MCC tumorigenesis can evidently proceed in the face of effective MCV-specific antibody responses, a small pilot animal immunization study revealed that a candidate vaccine based on MCV virus-like particles (VLPs) elicits antibody responses that robustly neutralize MCV reporter vectors in vitro.",
            "This suggests that a VLP-based vaccine could be effective for preventing the initial establishment of MCV infection.",
            "Author Summary",
            "For more than 50 years it has been known that some polyomavirus types can induce cancer in experimental animals.",
            "However, associations between the various polyomaviruses known to chronically infect most humans and the development of cancer have been difficult to uncover.",
            "Last year, DNA from a new human polyomavirus, called Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), was found embedded in an uncommon form of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.",
            "Emerging evidence indicates that most adults display detectable immune responses to MCV, suggesting that most individuals eventually become infected with the virus.",
            "In this study, we investigate antibodies that directly bind the protein coat of MCV, thereby obstructing its ability to penetrate cultured cells.",
            "We found that the magnitude of antibody responses against MCV varies dramatically among normal adults.",
            "Interestingly, patients suffering from MCV-associated Merkel cell carcinoma display uniformly strong antibody responses against the virus.",
            "This suggests that the development of Merkel cell carcinoma is preceded by an unusually robust MCV infection.",
            "It is currently unclear whether MCV infection may also be associated with additional diseases aside from Merkel cell carcinoma.",
            "Quantitation of immune responsiveness to the virus, using techniques reported here, could help identify such links.",
            "Introduction",
            "The Polyomaviridae are a diverse family of non-enveloped DNA viruses named for some family members' ability to cause various types of tumors in experimentally challenged animals.",
            "Although BK and JC polyomaviruses (BKV and JCV) are highly prevalent in human populations, neither virus has been clearly shown to cause cancer in humans (reviewed in).",
            "A previously unidentified polyomavirus was recently found associated with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a relatively unusual form of skin cancer that tends to strike elderly or immunocompromised individuals (, reviewed in).",
            "Sequences from this new virus, called Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV or MCPyV), have been confirmed to be present in a majority of MCC tumors.",
            "The viral DNA is maintained as a circular episome during productive infection but is clonally integrated into the cellular DNA of MCV-positive MCC tumors.",
            "Integrated viral genomes carry a characteristic pattern of mutations of the large T antigen gene that produce truncating deletions of the T antigen protein.",
            "The mutations abrogate the protein's ability to drive replication of the viral DNA but preserve regions with predicted oncogenic potential.",
            "In some integrated viral genomes, deletions also occur in the late region of the virus encoding the viral capsid proteins.",
            "Taken together, the available evidence suggests that nonproductive integration of MCV genomic DNA into the host cell's DNA is an etiologic factor underlying the development of most cases of MCC.",
            "Recent serological studies using recombinant MCV capsid proteins have shown that about 50\u201380% of adults display detectable MCV-specific antibody responses.",
            "This suggests that MCV infection is common, but only rarely leads to MCC.",
            "Although a majority of adults are seropositive for MCV, our initial serological studies suggest that some individuals display stronger humoral responses to MCV than others.",
            "To more accurately quantitate MCV-specific serum antibody responses in human subjects, we developed an assay for measuring antibody-mediated neutralization of cellular transduction with an MCV-based reporter vector.",
            "The assay employs very low viral particle doses, allowing improved accuracy and reproducibility compared to previously-reported MCV serological methods.",
            "Unlike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (EIAs), which simultaneously measure both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, viral neutralization assays have the useful feature of measuring only the subset of antibodies that are likely to confer protection against infection.",
            "Neutralization assays have therefore been used for characterizing candidate vaccines.",
            "Although VLP-based vaccines against viruses such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus are highly immunogenic, it appears that VLPs based on some polyomavirus types can be poorly immunogenic in animal model systems.",
            "Using the MCV reporter vector-based neutralization assay, we show that MCV VLPs elicit robust functional antibody responses and thus could potentially be employed in vaccines aimed at preventing MCV infection.",
            "Results",
            "Development of MCV-based reporter vectors",
            "Isolation of infectious MCV virions has not yet been reported.",
            "To simulate MCV infection in vitro, we generated gene delivery vectors employing the VP1 and VP2 capsid proteins of MCV.",
            "The MCV reporter vectors were produced by transfecting human embryonic kidney-derived 293TT cells with expression plasmids carrying codon-modified versions of MCV VP1 and VP2 genes of MCV isolate 339.",
            "For initial optimization experiments, the VP1 and VP2 expression plasmids were co-transfected with a reporter plasmid encoding GFP.",
            "The transfected cells produced high yields of capsids with a VP1\u2236VP2 ratio of about 6\u22361.",
            "A fraction of the particles encapsidated the GFP reporter plasmid.",
            "The GFP transducing potential of the MCV-based reporter vector particles was titered on HeLa cells, which were found to be permissive for transduction with the GFP reporter gene.",
            "Previously-identified polyomaviruses encode a minor capsid protein, VP3, whose translation initiates from an in-frame methionine (Met) codon within the VP2 open reading frame.",
            "However, MCV lacks the conserved Met-Ala-Leu motif that forms the amino-terminus of all previously described polyomavirus VP3 proteins.",
            "We generated expression plasmids encoding possible alternative VP3 proteins initiated from MCV VP2 Met46 or Met129 codons.",
            "While inclusion of VP2 improved the infectivity of the MCV reporter vector by about five-fold, compared with using VP1 alone, inclusion of the candidate VP3 expression constructs either slightly reduced or did not affect reporter vector infectivity (data not shown).",
            "The results suggest that, in contrast to other polyomaviruses, MCV may not encode a functional VP3 protein.",
            "It has recently been shown that bacterially-expressed VP1 capsomers based on MCV isolate 350 are serologically distinct from MCV339 capsomers.",
            "Like MCV339, MCV350 was isolated from an MCC tumor.",
            "We attempted to generate reporter vectors based on the MCV350 VP1 protein.",

            "Compared to control subjects, all MCV+ MCC patients in the study displayed unusually high-titer humoral responses to MCV.",
            "In an initial EIA-based study establishing the prevalence of serological responsiveness to MCV in human subjects, we found that sera from MCV+ MCC patients contained MCV-specific antibodies at levels that appeared to saturate the EIA at the tested 1\u2236500 serum dilution.",
            "EIA-saturating responses were less common among various groups of control subjects.",
            "In the current report we extend these observations, providing accurate scalar measurements of human seroresponsiveness to MCV.",
            "The human polyomaviruses BKV and JCV are thought to establish latent infections that persist for decades.",
            "For these virus types, reactivation from latency and active shedding of virions, which can occur under conditions of immunosuppresion, is positively correlated with serum antibody responses to the viral capsid proteins.",
            "Thus, strong seroresponsiveness against MCV may record a history at some point of relatively uncontrolled MCV infection.",
            "Although it seems paradoxical that MCV infection would not be controlled by antibody responses expected to neutralize the infectivity of the virus, it is possible to imagine that MCV, like BKV and JCV, is able to establish a reservoir of latently infected cells.",
            "Such latent infections might be resistant to clearance by neutralizing antibodies and thus could serve as a durable source of immunogenic virions, even in the face of effective neutralizing antibody responses.",
            "Alternatively, a putative delayed immune response might have resulted in a high viral load that ultimately did induce high antibody levels.",
            "Since responses to BKV were similar in MCC patients and control subjects, it appears that MCC is associated with a specific failure to control MCV infection, as opposed to a more generalized failure to control all polyomavirus infections.",
            "It is important to note that about a third of control subjects we studied displayed MCV responsiveness in the same range as MCV+ MCC patients (Figure 4).",
            "In light of the rarity of MCC (roughly 1500 cases per year in the United States, reviewed in), the results imply that most individuals who mount strong serological responses against MCV will not ultimately develop MCC.",
            "This is reminiscent of data indicating that exposure to ultraviolet light correlates with (but obviously does not guarantee) the development of MCC (reviewed in).",
            "Taken together, the results suggest a model in which uncontrolled MCV infection is one of multiple carcinogenic insults underlying the development of most cases of MCC.",
            "Although MCV DNA has been detected in skin, bowel, lymph node, and respiratory tract samples the normal site or sites of productive MCV replication and the character of actively replicating MCV strains remains unclear.",

            "MCV DNA sequences have recently been detected in a fraction of non-melanoma, non-MCC skin cancers, but a causal link between MCV and these forms of cancer has not yet been clearly established.",
            "While it is formally possible that neutralization of authentic MCV in the bona fide cellular target might differ with neutralization in 293TT cells, our results suggest that the current assay provides quantitative analysis of seroreactivity to a large subset of MCV neutralizing antibodies as reflected by the high rates of seropositivity detected in both MCC patients and in the general population.",
            "This assay can reveal potential links between the immunogenic infection with the virus and a disease state, such as MCC.",
            "Compared to VLP-based EIAs, the neutralization assay presented in this work demands less operator hands-on time and provides substantially more accurate results.",
            "Thus, the neutralization assay should become a preferred technique for investigating possible correlations between highly immunogenic MCV exposure and other disease states, including non-MCC cancers.",
            "It may be possible to increase the throughput of the assay by initially identifying high-titer subjects using a single serum dilution point.",
            "For example, a cutoff of 90% neutralization at the 1,600-fold serum dilution would have correctly identified all subjects with EC50 titer values greater than 20,000.",
            "The apparent absence or very low level of VP1 protein expression we have observed in MCC tumors confirms previous suggestions that the virus does not actively replicate in MCC tumors.",
            "The finding is also consistent with the concept that the tumors are under immunological pressure favoring reduced expression of capsid proteins.",
            "This reduced expression could be due either to mutations in VP1, as appears to be the case for MCV350, or due to control of VP1 expression at transcriptional, RNA processing or translational levels.",
            "In any event, it appears to be unlikely that robust MCV capsid-specific antibody responses are directly primed by the MCC tumor, suggesting that strong seroresponsiveness to MCV indicates a prior history of active MCV infection of non-tumor or (pre-tumorous) tissues.",
            "In human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, the virally induced cellular changes that lead to development of cancer occur in the absence of a productive viral infection and in the presence of existing neutralizing antibodies.",

            "Development of MCC likewise seems to occur in the presence of effective humoral responses, but a prophylactic vaccine might nevertheless be effective for preventing the initial establishment or dissemination of MCV infection.",
            "In addition, more research might unveil MCV as a causative agent in more common public health threats, if so, a prophylactic vaccine might be beneficial.",
            "To begin to explore the idea that a VLP-based vaccine against MCV might be effective, we immunized animals with a candidate MCV vaccine composed of MCV VP1/VP2 VLPs.",

            "Results from a large randomized clinical trial, the Women's Health Initiative, indicate a poorer outlook in users of combined estrogen-progestin therapy, represented by a larger proportion of tumors with lymph-node metastases and by differentiated tumors.",
            "In contrast, observational studies have repeatedly reported less malignant clinical features as well as improved prognosis in HRT users.",
            "This finding may be due to biases such as closer medical surveillance and reduced sensitivity and specificity of mammography screening in women on HRT, and the exclusion of women with preclinical breast-cancer lesions before initiation of hormone therapy.",

            "For the association with HRT use, we calculated the two-sample Welch t statistic.",
            "For association with age, we used the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.",
            "Larger absolute values of either statistic correspond to a stronger association with HRT status and age, respectively.",
            "Positive values of the statistic indicate that a gene is over-expressed in HRT users, and vice versa.",
            "The cut-off for deciding that a gene gi is significantly differentially expressed is not based on the usual p values.",
            "Instead, we select genes based on their local false discovery rate (FDR) as described in.",
            "The quantity fdri associated with gene gi specifies the proportion of false-positive results that can be expected among genes that have the same test statistic ti.",
            "Equivalently, we can interpret 1 minus fdri as the probability that gene gi is truly associated with the clinical variable of interest.",
            "The genes under study were assumed to be a mixture of differentially and non-differentially expressed genes, where the distribution of t statistics for non-differentially expressed genes can be inferred from random permutations of the data.",
            "Initially, all genes with local FDR <0.2 were selected as candidate genes for discriminating between HRT users and non-users.",
            "This liberal cut-off point was chosen because the aim of the present study was not to identify specific genes, but rather patterns of expression.",
            "A high cut-off level for gene selection would be more likely to identify genes strongly linked to exposure to HRT, but not comprehensive biologically relevant patterns.",
            "Preliminary analysis of the clinical data indicated that HRT use was associated with age, and thus that age is a possible confounding factor for the relationship between gene expression and HRT use (Table 1).",
            "We therefore removed HRT-associated genes that were significantly correlated with age in the reference group of ER-positive non-HRT users (n = 50).",
            "The significance cut-off point was again based on the local FDR estimate, here for the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.",
            "Genes with local FDR <0.4 for age were excluded from the list of HRT candidate genes.",
            "The 72 patients with ER-positive tumors in the study cohort were hierarchically clustered based on the age-adjusted HRT candidate gene list.",
            "We used average linkage and Euclidean distances; each gene was robustly standardized by subtracting the median and dividing by the interquartile range of expression prior to clustering.",
            "We used consensus clustering to assess the stability of the resulting grouping of samples and found it to be robust (see additional file 1).",
            "We used Kaplan-Meier estimates with the log-rank test for establishing the univariate association between cluster membership and recurrence-free survival.",
            "We modeled multivariate survival using the Cox proportional hazards model.",
            "Hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were computed from the Wald test statistics; the p value for each variable is based on the likelihood ratio test comparing the full model and the model without the tested variable, using the asymptotic \u03c72 distribution of the likelihood ratio.",
            "The multivariate models were adjusted for age, Elston grade, tumor size, lymph node status, PR status, and HRT use.",
            "For validation, we used a simple supervised clustering scheme, in which groups identified in the study cohort through hierarchical clustering were characterized via their centroids (i.e. by averaging gene expression for each group).",
            "All patients in the validation cohort were assigned to the centroid with the smallest Euclidean distance for the same robustly standardized genes.",
            "For comparison with MCF-7 cells, we chose genes that were found to be responsive to both estrogen and tamoxifen, based on the experimental data described previously and deposited in the Stanford Microarray Database.",
            "Cells were treated with either 10 nM 17\u03b2-estradiol and harvested at 4, 8, and 24 hours following treatment, or with 1 and 6 \u03bcM of tamoxifen and harvested after 48 hours.",
            "Genes chosen showed a consistent minimum fold change for estradiol exposure and an inverse fold change for tamoxifen exposure, when compared with untreated control groups (see additional file 1).",
            "Response to hormone treatment and sensitivity to tamoxifen is a standard criterion for defining ER-regulated genes, and while it will not capture all anti-estrogen-responsive genes, we were specifically interested in genes that can be expected to be regulated by the presence of both HRT and tamoxifen.",
            "For genes that fulfilled this criterion and were associated with HRT use, we computed fold changes between HRT users and non-users, and compared them with the fold changes found in the experimental data.",
            "Results",
            "Non-HRT users were older than HRT users at time of diagnosis (p = 0.001; Table 1), but no difference in average tumor size (p = 0.39) or proportion of patients with lymph-node metastasis (p = 1.0) was evident.",
            "Significantly more ER negative tumors were seen in HRT users (31% versus 11%, p = 0.02).",
            "No difference in progesterone-receptor status, recurrence-free survival (defined as lack of distant metastases or death within 5 years of diagnosis) or Elston grade was seen between users and non-users of HRT (Table 1).",
            "Comparisons using only patients with ER-positive tumors yielded similar results.",
            "A preliminary study of the distribution of t statistics comparing gene expression between HRT users and non-users for all 88 patients indicated that the observed differences are almost exclusively due to the differences observed in the ER-positive tumors, whereas the ER-negative tumors contribute little or no information on differential expression (see supplementary Figure 1 and the associated discussion in additional file 1).",
            "As the difference in expression profiles between HRT-users and non-users was confined to ER-positive tumors, we limited all further analysis to this group (n = 72).",
            "Among the 72 patients with ER-positive tumors, 22 were HRT users and 3 (14%) experienced recurrence or death due to breast cancer within 5 years of diagnosis.",
            "Recurrence among non-users was seen in 14 patients (28%; p = 0.24).",
            "We observed 331 genes to be differentially expressed between HRT users and non-users, with a local FDR \u2264 0.2, of which 54% were down-regulated in HRT users.",
            "We also found 580 genes that were correlated with age in non-users of HRT with a local FDR \u2264 0.4.",
            "We removed the 55 genes that were on both lists, which yielded an age-adjusted HRT associated gene list of 276 genes (The annotated list of genes can be found in additional file 2).",
            "Molecular classification of patients based on HRT- associated genes",
            "The 72 ER-positive cancers were grouped using hierarchical clustering on the expression profiles of the 276 genes (Figure 1).",
            "Each column corresponds to a patient labeled according to HRT use, recurrence or death within 5 years, Elston grade 3, lymph node metastasis, and ER protein levels.",
            "Two distinct clusters emerged.",
            "Obviously, these clusters differed significantly in the proportion of patients receiving HRT (100% in the HRT-associated cluster versus 13% in the non-HRT-associated cluster, p < 10E-9).",
            "There was, however, no significant difference with regard to type and duration of HRT use between the groups.",
            "In the HRT-associated cluster, 11 (77%) out of 13 patients used combined therapy with estrogen and progesterone, and the average duration of HRT use was 6.2 years.",
            "The corresponding figures in the non-HRT associated cluster were 4 (50%) out of 8 HRT users (p = 0.34) and 8.8 years (p = 0.42), respectively.",
            "The clusters differed significantly with regard to ER protein levels (p = 0.02), but not Elston grade (p = 0.67) or lymph node status (p = 1.00).",
            "All patients in the HRT-associated cluster were recurrence free 5 years after diagnosis and thus, had a significantly better recurrence-free survival (p = 0.03), even after adjusting for Elston grade, tumour size, lymph node status, PR status, HRT use, and age in the multivariate model (p = 0.001, see supplementary Table 1 in additional file 1).",
            "Validation of molecular classification",
            "In the validation cohort, the clustering split the 131 tumors into two groups of 68 non-HRT-like and 63 HRT-like expression profiles (Figure 2).",
            "Each column corresponds to a patient labeled according to recurrence or death within 5 years, Elston grade 3, lymph-node metastasis, and ER protein levels.",
            "As no HRT information was available for the validation cohort, the data could only be used to confirm the prognostic potential of the clustering.",
            "Tumors with HRT-associated profiles had better recurrence-free survival (p = 0.02), lower Elston grade (p = 0.02), lower protein levels of ER (p = 0.02), and were more often node-negative.",
            "When only patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen (n = 51) were included, we found patients in the HRT-associated cluster to have a significantly better survival (p = 0.04), even after adjusting for the effects of Elston grade, lymph node status, PR status, tumor size, and age at time of diagnosis in the multivariate model (p = 0.001, see supplementary Table 1 in additional file 1).",
            "For patients not receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy (n = 80), the the survival difference between the clusters was still significant (p = 0.03), even after adjustment for potential confounders (p = 0.02), but the relationship between the clusters was reversed; patients in the HRT-associated cluster did worse, indicating that tamoxifen influenced the apparent beneficial prognostic effect of HRT-associated gene expression.",
            "This effect was not seen in the study cohort, probably explained by the small number of patients (n = 7; 8%) left without adjuvant hormonal therapy.",
            "Figure 3 shows the survival (Kaplan-Meier curves, i.e. no adjustment) of the patient cohorts with the respective gene expression signatures.",
            "While patients with the HRT-like signature did better in the overall validation cohort (Figure 3b), the main benefit was experienced by those receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy (Figure 3d), whereas the small benefit for those treated only with surgery and radiation therapy was convincingly non-significant (Figure 3c).",
            "Comparison of expression-fold changes with cell-line results",
            "Of the 276 genes associated with HRT use, 84 unique genes corresponding to 96 probe sets were found to be estrogen- and tamoxifen-responsive in the experimental data described in (see additional file 3).",
            "In order to compare the regulatory effect of HRT in breast cancer, and estrogen and tamoxifen in cell lines, we grouped genes into those that are down-regulated (n = 54) and up-regulated (n = 30) in HRT users.",
            "Figure 4 summarizes the fold changes induced in these two groups of genes by estrogen and tamoxifen.",
            "Fold changes are shown on a log2 scale, so the dashed line at zero corresponds to no differential expression, whereas positive values indicate upregulation in treated cells and negative values indicate downregulation in treated cells compared with untreated controls.",
            "Figures 4a and 4b indicate a negative correlation between the effects of HRT and estrogen; the genes that are downregulated by HRT are predominantly upregulated by estrogen, and vice versa.",
            "In contrast, we saw positive correlation between the effects of HRT and low doses of tamoxifen (Figure 4c); Figure 4d shows a similar, although weaker relationship for high doses of tamoxifen.",
            "Discussion",
            "We have shown that a gene expression profile in ER-positive HRT users, based on 276 genes, is significantly associated with better survival, despite being linked to lower levels of the ER protein.",
            "HRT use by itself could not be used as a predictor of outcome.",
            "The gene-expression profile remained significantly associated with survival even after adjusting for Elston grade, lymph-node status, PR status, tumor size, treatment, HRT use, and age.",
            "The association between expression profile and survival was validated in a separate cohort of adjuvantly treated patients with breast cancer.",
            "On a more speculative note, a comparison with cell line data indicated that long-term use of HRT may exert a tamoxifen-like effect on ER-positive breast-cancer cells.",
            "The majority of HRT users exhibiting an HRT-like gene expression pattern used a combined estrogen+progesteron regimen, however, owing to lack of power, we are unable to attach any significance to this finding.",
            "Our results indicate that HRT use appears to alter only the expression profiles of ER-positive breast cancers.",
            "This finding is consistent with known biological and clinical observations, given that only ER-positive cells are expected to preferentially respond to estrogen exposure.",
            "In agreement with our findings, the Tamoxifen Chemoprevention Trial showed reduction of breast-cancer risk only for ER-positive tumors, further supporting the fundamental specificity of the in vivo ligand-estrogen receptor effects.",
            "In the validation cohort, the superior outcome of the HRT-associated cluster was apparent only in those patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen, suggesting that we can identify patients who preferentially benefit from tamoxifen therapy.",
            "This observation is made more noteworthy by the fact that these patients had lower ER protein levels and would normally be considered less likely to respond to tamoxifen.",
            "Thus, the expression pattern of a tumor may add predictive value for the response to hormonal treatment to the ER protein levels.",
            "Paradoxically, although HRT is considered an ER agonist, the expression profile induced after prolonged use of HRT was opposite to that of estradiol and consistent with tamoxifen effects (Figure 4) in MCF-7 cells.",
            "The exact ramifications of this observation are not clear, but it is known that very high doses of estradiol (e.g. diethylstilbestrol) induce clinical tumor regression, similar to anti-estrogens.",
            "Intriguingly, recent experimental evidence suggests that estradiol induces apoptosis in breast-cancer cells that have developed resistance to tamoxifen therapy.",
            "The idea that tamoxifen therapy following estradiol stimulation may have a similar effect as estrogen following tamoxifen on cell death is interesting from a therapeutic point of view, but requires further investigation.",
            "Earlier studies have found HRT-use to be associated with lower mortality, which has in part been ascribed to the so called \"healthy drug-user effect\", i.e. that women using HRT are healthier than average to begin with.",
            "Previous studies of the influence of HRT on breast-cancer characteristics and prognosis have yielded somewhat conflicting results.",
            "Observational studies indicate less aggressive tumor characteristics in HRT users, while the only randomized study published to date shows that tumors of HRT users are larger and more likely to have spread outside the mammary gland.",
            "Favorable tumor characteristics are expected if we assume that HRT users are under closer surveillance and thus would be diagnosed earlier in the tumor progression than non-users.",
            "Similarly, improved breast-cancer survival, shown in some studies, is also anticipated, although the specific contribution from surveillance and actual biological effects of HRT, respectively, are not readily disentangled.",
            "Jernstrom et al, however, showed that survival was better even after adjusting for stage, which supports the notion that HRT associated tumors are biologically different.",
            "In line with our findings, no significant difference in recurrence or survival was seen in a case-control study when comparing 142 patients with breast cancer using HRT at time of diagnosis with 284 age-matched patients not using HRT.",
            "ER levels were, however, both qualitatively and quantitatively decreased in HRT users.",
            "This finding was replicated in postmenopausal monkeys (Cynomolgus macaques), where nearly 3 years of exposure to HRT, including estradiol and progesterone, gave significantly lower levels of ER in breast tissue.",
            "Among the genes most strongly regulated in the HRT- and non-HRT associated clusters, many were involved in either DNA repair (e.g. RRM2) or cell-cycle regulation (e.g. p63).",
            "Regulated by p53, RRM2 is essential for DNA synthesis and repair46.",
            "As a p53 homologue, the p63 gene plays a role in tumor progression and differentiation.",
            "In our study, p63 was over-expressed in HRT associated tumors and has previously been found to be exclusively expressed on the protein level in normal breast parenchyma, partially expressed in ductal hyperplasia, rarely expressed in carcinoma in situ, and not expressed in invasive carcinomas.",
            "Whether patients with invasive tumors used HRT at time of diagnosis was not stated.",
            "The non-randomized setting of our study is a major weakness.",
            "It could be argued that the ER negativity seen in HRT users was confounded by their younger age compared with non-users or by a preferential difficulty to include small ER-positive tumors from HRT users (who may be under closer surveillance and thus diagnosed with smaller tumors).",
            "Reassuringly, the association between gene-expression profile and survival remained significant after adjustment for age, stage, and grade.",
            "However, factors related to both HRT use and tumor biology, e.g. level of endogenous estrogen and receptor proteins or body weight, would still confound our results.",
            "Postmenopausal breast-cancer risk associated with high body mass index is largely the result of increase in bioavailable estradiol.",
            "However, the increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer associated with HRT seems confined to non-obese women, thus adding complexity to the relationship between the reason for taking HRT, endogenous factors, and breast-tumor biology.",
            "Furthermore, the small sample size reduces precision, leaving subtle differences undetected.",
            "We note in closing that we have not attempted to optimize the 276-gene signature for prediction through the use of cross-validation, as for example done by Pawitan et al.",
            "The purpose of this study has been entirely exploratory, and we use prediction only incidentally to validate the superior outcome for the HRT-like expression profile;; the tumor subclasses may have clinical implications, but the gene signature is not intended as a clinical tool, to compare these.",
            "Despite recent advances in therapy, approximately one-quarter of all women diagnosed with breast cancer will die from the disease.",
            "Improved targeting of future therapies is thus of utmost importance.",
            "Our study provides for the first time a description of the effect on the tumor gene expression of HRT use.",
            "Conclusion",
            "HRT alters the expression profiles of ER-positive breast cancers and patients with an HRT-related expression profile had a better prognosis despite lower ER levels.",
            "The superior prognosis seen with a HRT-associated expression pattern, also validated in a separate cohort of patients with breast cancer, remained stable even after adjusting for Elston grade, lymph node status, progesterone receptor status, tumor size, treatment, and age.",
            "The favorable survival in HRT users seemed to be confined to those treated with tamoxifen.",
            "We speculatively propose that similarities in gene expression between HRT-exposed tumors and tamoxifen-treated breast cancer cells may indicate the mechanism by which the HRT profile is related to survival."

            "Chronic inflammation from recurring trauma is an underlying pathophysiological basis of numerous diseases.",
            "Furthermore, it may result in cell death, scarring, fibrosis, and loss of tissue function.",
            "In states of inflammation, subsequent increases in oxidative stress and cellular division may lead to the accelerated erosion of telomeres, crucial genomic structures which protect chromosomes from decay.",
            "However, the association between plasma inflammatory marker concentrations and telomere length has been inconsistent in previous studies.",
            "Objective",
            "The purpose of this study was to determine the longitudinal association between telomere length and plasma inflammatory biomarker concentrations including: CRP, SAA, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, VEGF, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10.",
            "Methods",
            "The longitudinal study population consisted of 87 subjects.",
            "The follow-up period was approximately 2 years.",
            "Plasma inflammatory biomarker concentrations were assessed using highly sensitive electrochemiluminescent assays.",
            "Leukocyte relative telomere length was assessed using Real-Time qPCR.",

            "Introduction",
            "Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures which act as vanguards against chromosomal decay.",
            "The repetitive (TTAGGG)n sequences of telomeres are located at the distal ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and span 8\u201312 kb at birth.",
            "Erosion of telomeres below critical lengths may lead to aberrant recombination, chromosomal fusion, and even subsequent neoplasia.",
            "Indeed, numerous epidemiological investigations have implicated diminished telomere length with increased risk of adverse health outcomes.",
            "For instance, previous studies have reported that shorter telomeres were significantly associated with increased overall cancer risk, in addition to decreased survival rate amongst diagnosed cases.",
            "Furthermore, truncated telomeres have been found to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.",
            "Telomeres truncate by 30\u2013200 bp with every mitotic division as a consequence of intrinsic limitations in lagging-strand DNA synthesis.",
            "As a result, telomere length may provide a portrait of the mitotic history of a cell.",
            "Maintaining sufficient telomere length involves an interplay between factors which erode telomeres, and factors which extend them.",
            "Extension of telomeres can be accomplished via activity of the ribonucleoprotein telomerase.",
            "Although constitutively expressed in germ line tissue and omnipotent stem cells, telomerase is only basally expressed in most somatic tissue; thus resulting in gradual decay of telomeric repeats.",
            "Aside from cellular division, telomeric shortening can be further intensified by extrinsic environmental factors which induce oxidative stress under conditions of inflammation.",
            "Therefore, telomere length may also be viewed as a marker that is reflective of cellular coping; providing resilience against biochemically-induced genomic trauma.",
            "Inflammation is a complex physiological response to deleterious stimuli such as injury and infection.",
            "The inflammatory process may be acute as a result of transient stimuli, or may persist as a chronic state as a result of continual exposure.",
            "Chronic inflammation is an underlying pathophysiological basis of numerous diseases such as cancer, myocardial infarction, and lung failure.",
            "With recurrent injury to tissue, subsequent cell death, scarring, and fibrosis may lead to permanent loss of function.",
            "Chronic inflammation may result in both cellular apoptosis and necrosis; facilitating the release of potent reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxides, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide from mitochondria into the vicinity.",
            "These oxidizing agents can induce genomic trauma such as double-stranded breaks and chemical changes to the telomeric sequences of DNA.",
            "Indeed, previous studies found that exposure to airborne particulate matter is associated with increased oxidative damage to the genome, as reflected by urinary concentrations of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an oxidized nucleoside of DNA.",
            "Furthermore, oxidative stress has also been shown to produce chemical alterations to purines and pyrimidines of telomeric oligonucleotides in the form of 8-oxoguanine adducts.",
            "Should these chemical alterations occur in vivo, inhibition of the interaction between Telomeric repeat-binding factors (TRF1/TRF2) and telomeric sequences may produce instability of the shelterin loop complex; potentially leading to telomeric erosion, dysregulation of gene expression, chromosomal fusion, and disruption of cellular function.",
            "Recent studies found that prolonged exposure to particulate air pollution increases levels of acute phase proteins and vascular injury related inflammatory mediators including C-Reactive Protein (CRP), serum intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and serum vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1); important biomarkers of cancer and cardiovascular disease.",
            "Additionally, inflammation may trigger the release of interleukins (IL); a subset of cytokines which can produce highly variable physiological and immune responses in different cell types.",
            "In particular, Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine primarily produced by macrophages, that mediates inflammatory diseases by initiating and potentiating inflammatory responses and hematopoiesis.",
            "Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an equally important cytokine produced by macrophages, which acts as a chemo-attractant for neutrophils during acute inflammatory responses.",
            "Moreover, IL-8 has been shown induce rapid mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and subsequent differentiation into leukocytes.",
            "This attribute of IL-8 may have important implications with respect to telomere erosion since increased mitotic division is required to replenish mobilized HSC.",
            "Although inflammation and immune response may be responsible for both cytokine production and telomeric erosion, a number of interleukins including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 have been shown to increase telomerase activity in vitro which may maintain telomere length; illustrating the complexity of these molecular interactions.",
            "Despite numerous studies showing the association between telomere length and various chronic diseases, the intricate causal relationship between these variables has been difficult to unravel.",
            "The association between telomere length and disease may be driven by an unmeasured common cause (confounder), such as underlying chronic inflammation.",
            "Although the association between inflammatory markers and chronic health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease has been firmly established, the relationship between these markers and telomere dynamics is less defined.",
            "IL-6, CRP, and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-\u03b1) have been found in several studies to be associated with decreased telomere length   .",
            "Although well-powered, most of these studies have been of cross-sectional design.",
            "Investigation into the biological interplay between these molecular markers over time in a longitudinal setting would further add to the understanding of the etiological basis of chronic diseases.",
            "Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the longitudinal associations between telomere length and plasma inflammatory biomarker concentrations including: CRP, Serum Amyloid A (SAA), sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10.",
            "Furthermore, we explored whether these inflammatory biomarkers modify the rate of telomeric change over a 2 year follow-up period.",
            "We hypothesize that increased levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers is correlated with decreased telomere length, and intensifies the rate of erosion over the follow-up period.",
            "The prospective determination of plasma inflammatory mediators and telomere length at multiple time points is particularly important in addressing numerous gaps in current knowledge, including the dynamic relationship between inflammation, immune response, and genomic trauma.",

            "In the Nova Scotia Health Survey of 1995, those in the lowest tertile of telomere length (4.1\u20135.0 kb) had significantly higher levels of serum CRP levels compared to those in the middle (5.0\u20135.5 kb) and highest tertile of telomere length (5.5\u20138.2 kb) p-trend\u200a=\u200a0.005.",
            "Furthermore, the Cardiovascular Health Study found a similar negative association between CRP concentration and telomere length with an estimate of \u22120.059+/\u22120.003SE, p\u200a=\u200a0.02.",
            "CRP is a non-specific acute phase protein produced in the liver.",
            "CRP is typically undetected in the plasma of healthy individuals; however, its concentration dramatically rises with localized and systemic inflammation.",
            "Although expressed during inflammatory response, CRP is not informative with respect to specific locations of injury.",
            "The physiological purpose of CRP is to bind to phosphocholine expressed on the outer plasma membrane of apoptotic and necrotic cells to activate the complement system and subsequent phagocytosis.",
            "Furthermore, cells undergoing apoptosis and necrosis experience genomic degradation mediated by caspase-activated and waste-management DNA nucleases, respectively.",
            "Apoptotic and necrotic cells can also release reactive oxygen species from their mitochondria which can further induce oxidative damage to the telomeres of neighboring cells.",
            "Therefore, the negative correlation between increased plasma CRP and decreased telomere length may be attributed to the common cause of inflammation, mediated through oxidative cell damage.",
            "However, the cytotoxicity of the prominent occupational exposure (particulate matter from welding fumes) on the target tissue was not assessed due to the obvious practical limitations of population-based epidemiological studies.",
            "However, PM2.5 has been shown in observational studies to be associated with increased inflammatory response, in addition to being shown in laboratory studies to induce cytotoxic cell death   .",
            "Serum Amyloid",
            "A is also an acute phase protein which is elevated during acute and systemic inflammation.",
            "SAA is primarily produced by the liver and is associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the circulation.",
            "However, the exact in vivo functions of SAA are still not well defined.",
            "The association between SAA and telomere length may be driven the common cause of adiposity.",
            "SAA is also produced by adipocytes and is correlated with obesity and insulin resistance.",
            "Adipose cells also produce endogenous 17\u03b2-estradiols which can act as potent mitogens.",
            "Therefore, increased estradiol-induced mitotic division of HSC may result in increased telomere erosion in leukocytes.",
            "Furthermore, increased adiposity has also been linked with elevated vascular injury and inflammation, for which SAA is a marker.",
            "Inflammation from adiposity-related vascular injury may cause apoptotic or necrotic cell death, and subsequent telomere shortening by the aforementioned mechanisms.",
            "BMI is a convenient measure which is commonly used in epidemiological studies to control for confounding by adiposity.",
            "Although BMI was controlled in the analysis, it is not a perfect surrogate for degree of adiposity.",
            "The median BMI of the study population was high, but from a qualitative standpoint, it was not fully representative of adiposity due to the muscular nature of the boilermaker subjects.",
            "Therefore, there may be residual confounding by adiposity in the relationship between inflammation and telomere length.",
            "However, the estimate was quite significant even after Bonferroni-adjustment, which would suggest that the degree of residual confounding would have to be substantial in order to explain the observed association.",
            "Given the direction and magnitude of the observed association between telomere length, CRP, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1; it was more likely that vascular-injury related inflammation, for which SAA is another marker, explains more of the variability in telomere length than residual confounding by adiposity.",
            "In contrast to the vascular injury marker panel, no significant associations between inflammatory IL, chemokines, and telomere length were found in this study.",
            "Previous studies found significant relationships between these molecular markers.",
            "In particular, the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study found that cumulative inflammatory load, as indexed by the combination of high levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, was associated with increased odds for short leukocyte telomeres.",
            "Furthermore, a study of renal cancer found significant positive correlations between tumor TL and peripheral levels of IL-8 and IL-10.",
            "There may be both biological and methodological explanations for the discrepancy in findings between the studies.",
            "As previously mentioned, inflammation may be responsible for both IL production and telomeric erosion; however, interleukins including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 have been shown to increase telomerase activity, thus maintaining telomere length.",
            "Since the activity of various IL is diverse, the biological effects of each IL may counteract each other.",
            "Furthermore, differences in the underlying exposure profiles and inflammatory conditions between the subjects of various studies may induce production of different IL and/or differing amounts of IL.",
            "Indeed, the distribution of exposures and demographic characteristics such as PM2.5 exposure, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and race were substantially different across studies.",
            "Additionally, there were significant differences in study design, exposure assessment and operationalization, outcome assessment, and analysis between studies.",
            "In regards to our study, the variability in plasma IL concentrations may have been too narrow to drive variability in telomere length.",
            "In contrast, the plasma concentrations of vascular injury markers were much broader.",
            "Although the statistical power of this study was substantially increased with the use of repeated-measures, the sample size may not have been sufficient to compensate for the narrow variability of the plasma IL.",
            "Interestingly, none of the interaction terms between follow-up time and inflammatory markers examined in this study reached statistical significance.",
            "These null-findings are consistent with the hypothesis that immune response does not alter the rate of telomeric decay.",
            "However, caution should be taken when interpreting these findings, because the limited sample size and follow-up duration of this study precludes definitive evaluation of effect modification of rates.",
            "Although repeated-measures increase the power to detect subtle effects, there was a possibility that the null interactions may be non-informative.",
            "Furthermore, previous studies have shown that the rate of telomeric decay is greatest during early developmental stages of rapid growth between 0\u201310 years of age; whereas the rate of attrition significantly decreases into post-adolescence and adulthood.",
            "Indeed, only miniscule rates of attrition were observed over a 2 year period in the current study of adults.",
            "Therefore, incredibly substantial effects would be required in a short follow-up period to drive a truly significant interaction term, which would be difficult even in studies with large sample sizes with long follow-up duration.",
            "The most prominent strength of this study was its prospective design which allowed for improved assessment of the temporality between exposure, outcome, and covariates.",
            "Longitudinal analysis using mixed effects models allows for the incorporations of time-varying exposures, outcomes, and covariates; which permits exploration of the rates of change.",
            "Moreover, the longitudinal design enhances analytical control of confounding.",
            "Additionally, the study design imparts robustness against recall bias of the exposure and differential misclassification; as both the exposure and outcome were independent laboratory measurements.",
            "Moreover, the use of multiple repeated-measures throughout the follow-up period substantially increased the statistical power to detect subtle effects, beyond the apparent sample size of the study.",
            "Notably, exposure assessment was accomplished using highly sensitive electro-chemiluminescent assays on an extensive panel of eleven inflammatory markers.",
            "The Meso Scale Discovery platform offers superior dynamic detection ranges, accuracy, and reproducibility compared to traditional ELISA, which allows for more nuanced analyses of the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and telomere length.",
            "Furthermore, the outcome was assessed using qPCR which is currently the most labor- and cost-effective methods to measure telomere length in epidemiological studies.",
            "Not only does qPCR correlate well with gold-standard Southern blots, but also requires only a fraction of the genomic DNA, and is robust against detection of centromeric sequences.",
            "As with all scientific investigations, there were limitations of note.",
            "The practical restrictions of occupational epidemiology studies involving real human subjects creates complexities in the study design and analysis, which requires nuanced appreciation to evaluate.",
            "For instance, union policies and seasonal work-training schedules of the boilermaker subjects created a situation in which entry and exit from the study was staggered, therefore data was unbalanced.",
            "Fortunately, analysis of longitudinal data using versatile linear mixed models does not require balanced data under the aforementioned assumptions.",
            "There may be the possibility of bias due to unmeasured confounders.",
            "However, most notable confounders related to inflammatory markers and telomere length from prior studies were controlled for in the analysis.",
            "Although controlling for time-varying confounders in traditional models may result in selection bias, the degree of bias would depend on the true state-of-affairs between all the related variables; which is inherently unknowable.",
            "As with most occupational cohorts, the sample size of this study was limited.",
            "However, the entire source population from which the subjects were recruited was only 400 union members; therefore our current study population contains a significant proportion of the entirety.",
            "The use of multiple repeated-measures should compensate for this limitation by significantly increasing the statistical power to detect small effect sizes.",
            "There was also the possibility of healthy worker bias (selection bias) in which healthier subjects with lower inflammation, and longer telomeres tended to be recruited and/or remain in the study compared to others.",
            "Healthy worker recruitment bias would reduce generalizability of the results to the source population.",
            "Healthy worker selection bias, a form of loss of follow-up, would likely bias the estimates towards the null and underestimate the true effect.",
            "Lastly, the linear mixed models may have been over-adjusted because numerous covariates and white blood cell differentials needed to be controlled in order to minimize bias in the estimates.",
            "Although the variance may have been inflated from over-fitting, statistically significant estimates were still obtained for the analysis involving vascular injury markers and telomere length.",
            "In summary, this study provides an enticing glimpse into the relationship between systemic inflammation, immune response, and genomic degeneration.",
            "Significant negative correlations were found between telomere length and plasma concentrations of CRP and SAA.",
            "Furthermore, marginal yet insignificant negative associations were found between telomere length, and sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1.",
            "Conversely, no significant associations were found between plasma IL concentrations and telomere length.",
            "However, the limited concentration range of some of the IL in this study does not preclude their biological effects on telomere dynamics.",
            "Taken together, the findings from this study suggest that increased systemic inflammation, consistent with vascular injury, is associated with decreased leukocyte telomere length.",
            "Future prospective studies would benefit from larger sample sizes with a balanced study design in order to discern subtle effects.",
            "Additionally, extended follow-up periods with equally spaced repeated measures would be beneficial in accurately assessing effect modification by inflammatory status on the rate of telomere attrition."

            "Background",
            "Swimming pool disinfectants and disinfection by-products (DBPs) have been linked to human health effects, including asthma and bladder cancer, but no studies have provided a comprehensive identification of DBPs in the water and related that to mutagenicity.",
            "Objectives",
            "We performed a comprehensive identification of DBPs and disinfectant species in waters from public swimming pools in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that disinfect with either chlorine or bromine and we determined the mutagenicity of the waters to compare with the analytical results.",
            "Methods",
            "We used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to measure trihalomethanes in water, GC with electron capture detection for air, low- and high-resolution GC/MS to comprehensively identify DBPs, photometry to measure disinfectant species (free chlorine, monochloroamine, dichloramine, and trichloramine) in the waters, and an ion chromatography method to measure trichloramine in air.",
            "We assessed mutagenicity with the Salmonella mutagenicity assay.",
            "Results",
            "We identified > 100 DBPs, including many nitrogen-containing DBPs that were likely formed from nitrogen-containing precursors from human inputs, such as urine, sweat, and skin cells.",
            "Many DBPs were new and have not been reported previously in either swimming pool or drinking waters.",
            "Bromoform levels were greater in brominated than in chlorinated pool waters, but we also identified many brominated DBPs in the chlorinated waters.",
            "The pool waters were mutagenic at levels similar to that of drinking water (~ 1,200 revertants/L-equivalents in strain TA100\u2013S9 mix).",
            "Conclusions",
            "This study identified many new DBPs not identified previously in swimming pool or drinking water and found that swimming pool waters are as mutagenic as typical drinking waters.",
            "Disinfection by-products (DBPs) represent a ubiquitous exposure in developed countries.",
            "DBPs are formed by the reaction of disinfectants (e.g., chlorine, chloramines, ozone, or chlorine dioxide) with natural organic matter and/or bromide/iodide, and they are an unintended consequence of trying to kill pathogens in drinking water and swimming pools.",
            "More than 600 DBPs have been identified in drinking water, and many of them are mutagenic or carcinogenic.",
            "This complex mixture of DBPs includes volatile and skin-permeable DBPs, such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloketones (:).",
            "Inhalation and dermal absorption, which are the primary routes of exposure to DBPs during swimming, leads to higher blood levels of THMs than do oral exposures.",
            "Swimming pools constitute environments with high levels of DBPs in water and air due to continuous disinfection and constant organic load from bathers (e.g., urine, sweat, cosmetics, skin cells, and hair).",
            "One of the most prevalent DBPs in chlorinated swimming pools is THMs, with average concentrations ranging from 16 \u03bcg/L to 132 \u03bcg/L.",
            "Given the high nitrogen content of organic matter from bathers, nitrogenated species such as haloacetonitriles, nitrosamines, and chloramines are found in swimming pool water.",
            "Chronic exposure to DBPs through different routes has been associated with an increased risk for bladder cancer.",
            "Trichloramine and other volatile chemicals in swimming pools are respiratory irritants; pool attendance has been associated with asthma and other respiratory effects in Olympic swimmers and pool workers, and less clearly with recreational adult swimmers and children.",
            "However, the mechanisms are poorly understood, and it is not known with certainty whether trichloramine or other volatile pool DBPs are responsible.",
            "Despite the public health relevance, only a few studies, most rather recent, have investigated the chemistry and potential health effects of swimming pool water.",
            "A complete chemical characterization of DBPs in indoor swimming pools has not been reported.",
            "The only mutagenicity study of swimming pool water reported that organic extracts from three public indoor pools in Victoria, British Columbia (Canada), were mutagenic in Salmonella TA100.",
            "The authors found that acidified extracts eluted with ether were more mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation (rat liver S9) than without S9; however, nonacidified extracts eluted with acetone were mutagenic only in the absence of S9.",
            "One genotoxicity study of swimming pool water reported that the water and its fractions induced DNA damage in Hep-G2 cells (comet assay) and that most of the genotoxicity was in the lower-molecular-weight DBP fraction.",
            "Another study using the comet assay showed that pool water was more genotoxic than the source tap water and that the type of disinfectant and illumination conditions altered the genotoxicity.",
            "The present study involves an investigation in Barcelona, Spain, where we examined 49 healthy nonsmoking volunteers before and after swimming in public swimming pools treated with either chlorine or bromine to evaluate personal exposure and a range of biomarkers of genotoxicity and respiratory damage.",
            "To complement the exposure assessment, we evaluated the mutagenicity of the pool waters in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay and screened for DBPs, comprehensively identifying most DBPs detected and quantifying a few targeted DBPs and disinfectant species (THMs, chlorine, monochloramine, dichloramine, and trichloramine) in the pool waters and in the air phase above the water (THMs and trichloramine).",
            "In this article we present a comprehensive identification of DBPs and disinfectant species in the pool waters and compare the species formed in chlorinated versus brominated pool water with the corresponding mutagenicity of the waters.",

            "Sampling",
            "Water samples were collected from two large public swimming pools in Barcelona, Spain.",
            "One pool (33 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 2 m in size) used chlorine (sodium hypochlorite) for disinfection, after sand filtration; the other pool (20.9 \u00d7 13.2 \u00d7 1.3 m in size) used bromine (1-bromo-3-chloro-5,5-dimethyl-2,4-imidazolidinedione) for disinfection, after sand and granulated carbon filtration.",
            "Floor-to-ceiling height was 10 m and 5 m in the chlorinated and brominated pools, respectively.",
            "Quantitative analyses",
            "Free chlorine, monochloramine, dichloramine, trichloramine, and THMs were measured in composite pool water samples (1 L) collected from four different locations.",
            "Free chlorine, monochloramine, dichloramine, and trichloramine were measured immediately using the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) method with a portable photometer (DINKO Instruments, Barcelona, Spain).",
            "Water samples (40 mL) for THM measurements were quenched with 5 mg sodium thiosulfate and stored at 4\u00b0C until analysis on the same day.",
            "Chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform were measured using purge-and-trap gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (Tekmar 3100, Voyager MS; ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) following the method described by.",
            "Sixty-eight samples were collected from the chlorinated pool and 12 from the brominated pool for these quantitative analyses.",
            "Indoor air samples to measure THMs were collected with a pump located 60 cm above the floor and 1.5 m from the pool border.",
            "Air was pumped (7 mL/min) for 20 min through a Tenax TA cartridge (1.8 g; Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).",
            "Quality control was assured by daily calibration of the pump.",
            "Chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform were determined through an automatic thermal desorption unit (ATD 400; Perkin-Elmer, Madrid, Spain) coupled to a GC-electron capture detector (Perkin-Elmer).",
            "Sixty-eight air samples were collected from the chlorinated pool, and 12 from the brominated pool.",
            "Trichloramine was measured in pool air samples by pumping air (1.2 L/min) for 115 min, within 1 m from the water and at a height of 60 cm from the floor level, using a method described originally by.",
            "Trichloramine was captured on two 37-mm quartz-fiber filters, one of which was placed as a backup filter, both impregnated with 500 mL of a solution of diarsenic trioxide (4 g/L As2O3), sodium carbonate (40 g/L Na2CO3), and glycerol (40 mL/L C3H8O3).",
            "These filters were placed in a sampling cassette with a 37-mm cellulose support filter and a 37-mm Teflon filter to prevent chloride from airborne water droplets from being captured in the sampler.",
            "Impregnated filters were desorbed in 10-mL ultra-high quality, ultrapure water (specific conductivity, 17.8 M\u03a9/cm at 25\u00b0C), sonicated for 30 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 \u00d7 g after sampling.",
            "Trichloramine was reduced to chloride and subsequently analyzed by ion chromatography (Dionex DX100; Dionex BV, Bavel, the Netherlands; AS14A guard and AS14 highly selective anion column with self-regenerating suppressor; conductivity detector; flow rate, 1.0 mL/min).",
            "Six samples were collected from the chlorinated pool, and three from the brominated pool.",
            "Preparation of water extracts and concentrates",
            "For comprehensive GC/MS analyses and mutagenicity testing, pool water samples were collected at approximately noon on five different sampling events for the chlorinated pool (7 and 24 May, 11 June, and 17 September 2007) and two different sampling events for the brominated pool (16 July and 15 October 2007).",
            "Samples (28 L each) were collected using 2-L Teflon bottles (headspace-free) and were shipped overnight in coolers with icepacks to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency laboratory in Athens, Georgia (USA).",
            "Water samples were extracted immediately upon arrival using the XAD resin process of [for further details, see Supplemental Material (doi:10.1289/ehp.1001965)].",
            "The final extract was divided for comprehensive GC/MS analysis (1.0 mL, equivalent to 20 L water) and mutagenicity analysis (0.4 mL, equivalent to 8 L water, or 20,000\u00d7).",
            "Comprehensive GC/MS analyses",
            "Half of the 1.0-mL extract was derivatized with diazomethane [see Supplemental Material (doi:10.1289/ehp.1001965)] to enable the identification of haloacids (through their corresponding methyl esters); the other half was analyzed directly for other DBPs.",
            "Comprehensive GC/MS analyses were performed on a high-resolution magnetic sector mass spectrometer (Autospec; Waters, Inc., Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an Agilent model 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and operated at an accelerating voltage of 8 kV and source temperature of 200\u00b0C, in both low-resolution (1,000) and high-resolution (10,000) modes.",
            "Injections of 1 \u03bcL extract were introduced via a split/splitless injector (in splitless mode) onto a GC column (DB-5, 30-m \u00d7 0.25-mm i.d. 0.25-\u03bcm film thickness; J&W Scientific/Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).",
            "The GC temperature program consisted of an initial temperature of 35\u00b0C (4 min) and an increase at 9\u00b0C/min to 285\u00b0C (held for 30 min).",
            "Transfer lines were held at 280\u00b0C, and the injection port at 250\u00b0C.",
            "For qualitative identifications, mass spectra of unknown compounds in the finished and raw water concentrates were subjected initially to library database searching (using the 2005 NIST Mass Spectral Library database; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD).",
            "However, many DBPs were not present in the library database; in those cases, and also where a library match was insufficient to offer a tentative identification, high-resolution MS was used to provide empirical formulas for molecular ions and fragments.",
            "Mass spectra were also interpreted extensively to provide tentative structural identifications.",
            "When possible, pure standards were obtained to confirm identifications through a match of GC retention times and mass spectra.",
            "Chemical standards",
            "Chemical DBP standards were either synthesized (CanSyn Chem. Corp., Toronto, ON, Canada) or purchased at the highest level of purity (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA).",
            "The synthesis of (E)- and (Z)-bromochlorobutenedioic acid is presented in Supplemental Material (doi:10.1289/ehp.1001965).",
            "Mutagenicity assays",
            "The 20,000\u00d7 XAD/ethyl acetate extracts described above were solvent-exchanged into dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Burdick and Jackson, Muskegon, MI, USA) and diluted to 10,000\u00d7 and 1,000\u00d7.",
            "We performed the standard plate-incorporation Salmonella (Ames) mutagenicity assay in the base-substitution strain TA100 (hisG46 rfa \u0394uvrB, pKM101), obtained from B.N. Ames, Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (Oakland, CA, USA).",
            "We also tested the extracts in Salmonella strain RSJ100, which expresses the rat GSTT1 gene, and its control strain TPT100.",
            "These strains are homologous to TA100 except that they do not contain the pKM101 plasmid and either do or do not express GSTT1.",
            "These strains were obtained from F.P. Guengerich (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA).",
            "We did not use S9 mix because we assumed that pool water was similar to drinking water, and drinking water extracts are most mutagenic in the absence of S9 mix.",
            "Extracts were tested up to 100 \u03bcL/plate over a dose range of 0.01\u20130.3 L-equivalents (L-eq)/plate based on doses used for drinking water and a dose-range\u2013finding study.",
            "Because of limited amounts of samples available for testing in all three bacterial strains, only two samples from the chlorinated pool (C4 and C5) and two from the brominated pool (B1 and B2) were evaluated for mutagenicity, each at one plate per dose in single experiments.",
            "We incubated the plates for 3 days at 37\u00b0C, counted the colonies [revertants (rev)] on an automatic colony counter, and calculated linear regressions over the linear portion of the dose\u2013response curves to determine the mutagenic potencies (rev/L-eq).",
            "We defined a positive result as a dose-related response with two or more times the number of revertants observed in the DMSO control.",
            "The positive control for all strains was sodium azide at 3 \u03bcg/plate.",
            "We calculated linear regressions, slope values, the standard error of the slopes, and r2 values of the dose\u2013response curves and then compared the regression lines between strains RSJ100 (GST+) and TPT100 (GST\u2212) to obtain p-values using Statgraphics Centurion XVI (Statpoint Technologies, Inc., Warrenton, VA, USA).",
            "The model tests the null hypothesis that the slopes are equal; we set \u03b1 = 0.05 for the F-test with 2 degrees of freedom.",
            "Results",
            "DBPs",
            "Table 1 lists levels of free chlorine, chloramines, and THM species in the pool water and air.",
            "Although we did not detect trichloramine in the pool waters, we did find mean levels of 0.29 and 0.08 mg/m3 in the chlorinated and brominated pool air, respectively, indicating that most of it volatilized from the water into the air.",
            "We identified > 100 DBPs comprehensively in the pool waters [Table 2; see also Supplemental Material, Figure S1 (doi:10.1289/ehp.1001965)], including a large number of haloacids, halomethanes, haloacetonitriles, haloaldehydes, haloketones, halonitromethanes, haloamides, haloalcohols, and halophenols.",
            "All of these contained either bromine or chlorine; we detected no iodinated DBPs.",
            "Most DBPs have not been reported previously for swimming pool waters, and many were not present in the mass spectral library database.",
            "The identification of (E)- and (Z)-bromochlorobutenedioic acid (in their corresponding methyl ester forms) illustrates how we identified unknown DBPs.",
            "They eluted at different retention times (Figure 1A) but exhibited similar mass spectra (indicative of isomeric structures), each containing m/z 256/258/260, 225/227/229, and 59 (Figure 1B).",
            "The loss of 31 Da (typically OCH3) at m/z 225 and the presence of m/z 59 [typically C(O)OCH3] suggested the presence of a carboxylic acid methyl ester in the structures, with a molecular ion of m/z 256/258/260.",
            "Further, the m/z 256/258/260 isotopic pattern was indicative of one bromine and one chlorine atom, matching the calculated theoretical pattern [see Supplemental Material, Figure S2 (doi:10.1289/ehp.1001965)].",
            "This pattern results from the overlap of the two natural isotopes of bromine (79Br and 81Br) with the two natural isotopes of chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl).",
            "This information suggested a tentative structural identification of bromochlorobutenedioic acid dimethyl ester, with a monoisotopic molecular mass of 256 Da.",
            "Exact mass data provided by high-resolution MS supported this empirical formula (C6H6O4ClBr).",
            "The observed exact mass of the stronger molecular ion isotopic peak (m/z 257.9116) was within 0.0002 Da of the theoretical mass (m/z 257.9118).",
            "This supported the general structure of bromochlorobutenedioic acid dimethyl ester; however, the exact isomer assignments could not be made by MS data alone because the spectra were too similar, which is often the case for isomers.",
            "Two structural isomers are possible for this empirical formula, (Z) and (E), representing cis and trans isomers, respectively (Figure 1A).",
            "Fortunately, we observed both compounds in most of the pool water concentrates, so it just remained to be determined which specific isomer represented each GC/MS chromatographic peak.",
            "To make this determination, we synthesized the two possible isomers [see Supplemental Material (doi:10.1289/ehp.1001965)] and confirmed by a match of the GC retention time and mass spectra that the (Z) isomer is the first peak at 16.8 min and the (E) isomer is the second peak at 16.9 min in the pool water extracts (Figure 1A).",
            "Mutagenicity",
            "Table 3 and Figure 2 show the mutagenicity data for two samples from the chlorinated pool and two from the brominated pool in strain TA100.",
            "All of the samples were mutagenic in strain TA100 except for sample C5, which was the only sample that showed toxicity\u2014based on a reduction of rev/plate in TA100 at the highest doses (0.04 and 0.05 L-eq/plate).",
            "Table 4 shows the slopes, r2 values, and standard errors of the slopes for these data; the average mutagenic potency of the three mutagenic samples was 1,190 rev/L-eq.",
            "Only sample B1 was significantly more mutagenic in the GSTT1-expressing strain relative to the nonexpressing strain (Tables 3 and 4).",
            "This indicates that some portion of the mutagenic activity of sample B1 in strain RSJ100 was due to the presence of DBPs that were activated by GSTT1, such as the brominated THMs.",
            "Discussion",
            "Most analytical studies of pool water have measured only a few targeted DBPs, primarily chloroform and other THMs.",
            "Consequently, this study expands considerably our knowledge of the chemical composition and mutagenicity of swimming pool water beyond the chemical analysis of two outdoor pools by and the studies on pool water mutagenicity and genotoxicity.",
            "We found a greater number of DBPs in the chlorinated and brominated indoor pools studied here than have been found in chlorinated outdoor pools, which was not surprising, considering that DBPs can be volatilized or photolyzed in outdoor settings.",
            "In addition, although most people assume that chlorine levels in swimming pools are much higher than in chlorinated drinking water, the mean level of free chlorine (1.28 and 0.50 mg/L in the chlorinated and brominated pools, respectively) was similar to that found typically in drinking water.",
            "Because little is known regarding the mutagenicity and DBP composition of swimming pool water, we compared our data with those for drinking water, which are much more extensive.",
            "In addition, the pool water composition and mutagenicity reported here can be used to better understand the reported health effects of swimming pool water, such as asthma, irritation of eyes/throat/skin, and bladder cancer.",
            "Nitrogen-containing DBPs",
            "In general, we observed more nitrogen-containing DBPs (N-DBPs) in these pool water samples than are found typically in chlorinated drinking water.",
            "For example, we found a greater number of haloamides, halonitriles, haloanilines, haloanisoles, and halonitro-compounds than typically found in drinking water, and several chemicals within these families have not been reported previously in drinking water.",
            "In addition, we detected mono- and dichloramine in the pool waters (means of 0.29 and 0.38 mg/L, respectively, for mono- and dichloramine in the chlorinated pool, and a mean of 0.27 mg/L for monochloramine in the brominated pool).",
            "Because DPD analysis of chloramines cannot differentiate organic from inorganic forms of these compounds, it is possible that these levels are overestimated by the occurrence of organic chloramines in the swimming pool waters.",
            "Model studies with batch experiments show that survival of chloramines depends on the chlorine:nitrogen ratio.",
            "Considering this, the low concentrations of mono- and dichloramine reported in Table 1 are consistent with chlorine oxidation of continuous supplies of small amounts of nitrogen compounds coming from urine, sweat, skin, and other human residues.",
            "These levels are also similar to those reported by other researchers who used membrane-introduction MS, which does not have issues with interferences from organic chloramines.",
            "The N-DBPs, including chloramines, were not surprising to find because pool waters have a greater contribution of nitrogen-containing precursors due to human inputs.",
            "Because chloramines are known to cause eye irritation and other problems, pool operators generally try to add enough chlorine to get beyond the \u201cbreak point,\u201d such that these chloramines are destroyed, leaving residual chlorine.",
            "However, the amount of chlorine needed to reach \u201cbreak point\u201d is also dependent on other amines in the water.",
            "As we observed in this study, this goal is not always achieved because of continuous human inputs and rapid reactions forming chloramines.",
            "A few other N-DBPs also have been reported in swimming pool waters, including organic chloramines, and nitrosamines, several of which are carcinogenic.",
            "Comparison of brominated versus chlorinated pool waters",
            "Bromoform levels were much higher in the pools treated with bromine versus chlorine, but interestingly, other DBPs and their levels were similar in brominated versus chlorinated pools, likely owing to the high levels of bromide present already in Barcelona source waters that feed into drinking water treatment and further swimming pool treatment.",
            "In addition, when THMs are compared on a molar basis, the chlorinated pool actually contained somewhat higher levels of total THMs (mean, 306 nM) than the brominated pool (mean, 242 nM); this was possibly due to the carbon filtration used at the brominated pool that was not used at the chlorinated pool.",
            "Mutagenicity",
            "In the only other mutagenicity study of swimming pool water, found that three public indoor pools in Victoria, British Columbia (Canada), produced approximately 20,000 rev/L-eq in Salmonella TA100 (without S9 mix), compared with our finding of an average of 1,190 rev/L-eq in the two indoor pools in Barcelona.",
            "However, their solvent-extraction method was considerably different from ours, involving ether and acetone, whereas we used ethyl acetate.",
            "Although a direct comparison of the data is not possible, our study confirms their pioneering work from three decades ago showing that swimming pool water is mutagenic.",
            "In general, extracts of drinking water induce an average of 1,100 rev/L-eq in Salmonella strain TA100 (without S9 mix); however, values as high as approximately 15,000 rev/L-eq have been reported.",
            "Concentration methods such as reverse osmosis recover levels of mutagenic activity lower than those recovered by XAD resin, which is why we used XAD to prepare extracts of pool water.",
            "Our finding that the pool water mutagenicity was similar to that of drinking water may reflect the fact that the levels of mutagenic DBPs in the pool waters were similar to those in drinking water, despite the differences in the levels of specific classes of DBPs described above in pool versus drinking water.",
            "Our finding that some of the mutagenic activity of one sample (B1) from the brominated pool water was due to activation by GSTT1 suggests the presence of compounds that are activated to mutagens by this enzyme, such as brominated THMs, some methylene dihalides and bifunctional butanes, and/or 1,1-dichloropropene.",
            "Our chemical analysis (Table 1) showed that sample B1 had high concentrations of brominated THMs, especially bromoform.",
            "The high cytotoxicity and lack of mutagenicity of sample C5 may reflect the fact that the concentration of chloroform was 30% higher in this sample than in sample C4.",
            "Perhaps the higher concentration of chloroform, which is cytotoxic but not mutagenic, produced the observed cytotoxicity, preventing detection of mutagenic activity of the other DBPs present in sample C5.",
            "As reviewed by, many other DBPs in drinking water that we have now identified in pool waters are known to be mutagenic and/or carcinogenic, including the haloacetic acids, halonitromethanes, haloamides, haloacetonitriles, and unregulated haloacids.",
            "In addition to the mix of mutagenic DBPs identified in the pool water, many other DBPs have not yet been studied for health effects, and no doubt, many other DBPs remain to be identified that also may contribute to the observed mutagenicity of swimming pool water.",
            "In this regard, the study by, which found that the low-molecular-weight fraction of extracts from indoor and outdoor pools in Germany was the most potent of all fractions for inducing DNA damage in mammalian cells (using the comet assay), suggests that the low-molecular-weight DBPs may be most responsible for the genotoxic effect of swimming pool water.",
            "Also using the comet assay, found that pool water was more genotoxic than the source tap water; a similar analysis using the Ames assay would help in characterizing the relative mutagenicity of drinking versus pool water.",
            "Sources of mutagens unique to pool water could include active agents in sunscreens, which can be transformed to mutagens by exposure to free chlorine under conditions similar to swimming pool water.",
            "Our limited data indicate that the mutagenic potencies of chlorinated versus brominated pool waters were similar, as were the dose ranges over which the pool waters were mutagenic, approximately 0.1\u20130.3 L-eq/plate (Figure 2).",
            "In contrast, the typical dose range for drinking water mutagenicity is 0.3\u20131.5 L-eq/plate.",
            "This difference reflects the considerably higher toxicity of swimming pool water relative to drinking water, with the highest testable mutagenic dose of pool water being the lowest mutagenic dose of drinking water.",
            "Conclusions",
            "We identified > 100 DBPs in two indoor pools, including a prevalence of N-DBPs, likely formed from nitrogen-containing precursors from human inputs.",
            "This study provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of DBPs in swimming pool waters, as well as a clear demonstration of their mutagenicity.",
            "In addition, many DBPs we identified are new and have not been reported previously in pool waters.",
            "Bromoform levels were much greater in the brominated versus chlorinated pools.",
            "Compared with previous research on outdoor pools, we found a much greater number of DBPs in these indoor pools.",
            "The mutagenicity of these pool waters was similar to that of drinking water, indicating that the levels of mutagenic DBPs are similar in both waters.",
            "Subjects who swam in the mutagenic, chlorinated pool water evaluated in this study had increases in genotoxicity biomarkers that were associated with the concentrations of brominated THMs, but not chloroform, in their exhaled breath.",
            "These findings are especially relevant with regard to a case\u2013control study by in this issue that identifies an enhanced risk for bladder cancer associated with DBP exposure among people with genotypes that metabolize various DBPs.",
            "Further research on a wide array of swimming pools under various conditions of maintenance and use are warranted based on the limited but developing data now available on the chemical composition and health risks of swimming pool water."

            "As an indication of stats, we detennined levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyrox- ine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3) in children living in households where < 10 cigarettes were smoked per day.",
            "Eight PCB congeners (PCBs 101, 118, 138, 153, 170, 180, 183, and 187)  were measured in whole blood samples.",

            "In addition, the possible effects of cadmium, lead, and mercury on levels of thyroid h-ormones were examined.",
            "Blood concentrations and information on questionnaire data were available for 320 children 7-10 years of age.",
            "We found a statisticaly significant positive association between the mono-onho con- gener PCB 118 and TSH as well as statistically significant negative relationships of PCBs 138, 153, 180, 183, and 187 to FT3.",

            "The first survey in 1994-1995 con- sisted of questionnaires for the parents and a medical check-up of the children, including measurements of height and weight.",
            "We performed phlebotomy and serum biochemistry, along with the mea- surement of thyroid hormones, cadmium, and lead in whole blood, and we collected 24-hr urine samples to assess the excretion of mercury.",
            "Thyroid hormones are necessary for the development of brain function and cell growth; because of this, appropriate levels of peripheral thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3) are especially important in childhood.",

            "Exposure to PCBs is suspected of altering the pituitary thyroid feedback regulation through various mechanisms.",
            "Evidence could be drawn from animal and human studies on effects of planar and nonplanar PCBs that fre- quently show a decrease in peripheral thyrox- ine, whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) might be increased.",
            "One mechanism is hepatic microsomal induction of uridine diphosphate glucoronyl transferase (UDPGT) (4), possibly because of a similar molecular structure of planar and mono-ortho substitut- ed PCB congeners to that of the thyroxine molecule (5).",
            "The induction is mediated by the nuclear aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), to which only planar and coplanar PCBs have an affinity.",
            "Thus, enhanced metabolism of thyroxine (T4) by glucoronidation could lead to reduced peripheral T4 half-life and increased biliary excretion (4).",
            "Compensatory TSH secretion can follow depletion of peripheral T4 levels unless enhanced deiodi- nase activity in brain results in normally local T3 concentration (6).",
            "PCB could also possibly block type I mon- odeiodinases.",
            "It is estimated that up to 80% of circulating T3 results from tissue conversion of T4 to T3; subsequently, inhibition by PCB would lead to lower peripheral T3 levels and to increased TSH secretion if it is not compen- sated for by T4 de novo biosynthesis (4).",

            "Thus PCBs may interfere with endocrine function by imitating natural hormones (30,31).",
            "One mechanism of PCB 118 can be UDPGT induction mediated by the AhR.",
            "A second mode could be AhR inde- pendent; for instance, inhibition of mon- odeiodinase activity resulting in reduced con- version of peripheral T4 into T3.",
            "Third, direct acting at the pituitary via calcium channel stimulation or inhibition of FT4 uptake is possible.",
            "We expected that FT4 and FT3 would diminish with increasing PCB 118, but no association of that kind was detected.",
            "In contrast, we found relationships between all of the measured nonplanar PCB congeners and FT3.",
            "Because these congeners do not have an affinity to the AhR, only those that are AhR independent are potential mechanisms.",
            "A blockage of peripheral deiodi- nase activity could be responsible for our findings of depleted FT3.",
            "Reduced FT3 might be accompanied by a substrate increase, but we did not observe any eleva- tion of FT4.",
            "It is possible that FT4 is increas- ingly converted to inactive reverse T3, which was not determined in the present study.",
            "There are clinical syndromes with selec- tively low T3.",
            "For the children with FT3 below the reference value we cannot rule out that this reduction is clinically relevant.",
            "However, for the entire group of children we would not categorize low FT3 as a functional disorder, but as a moderate shift within the normal range of FT3, as is expected in envi- ronmental exposure studies (32).",

            "Although whole blood and plasma values are not equivalent because of higher values in plasma, Dutch investigations of mothers and infants found median concentrations in cord plasma (n = 373-382) comparable to those in whole blood in our sample of elementary schoolchildren (medians from cord plasma: PCB 118, 0.04 pg/L; PCB 138, 0.11 pg/L; PCB 153, 0.15 pg/L; and PCB 180, 0.08 pg/L) (3).",
            "Maternal plasma (n = 415) median concentrations were four times higher for PCB 118 (0.15 pg/L), PCB 138 (0.56 pg/L), PCB 153 (0.84 jg/L), and PCB 180 (0.50 pg/L) (3).",
            "Koopman-Esseboom and co-workers (33) as well as Sauer et al. (34) showed a positive correlation between PCBs-planar and nonplanar-in human milk and TSH values in infants (week 2 and month 3, n = 78-82) and a negative association with FT4 in week 2 in the high-exposure group.",
            "In this study on background levels of PCB (33), an effect of higher plasma levels of PCB on maternal total T3 and total T4 was also reported.",
            "Recently, a study on 1-year- old Japanese infants who were breast-fed showed decreased values of T3 and T4 depending on the levels of PCDD/PCDF and coplanar PCB in mother's milk, whereas TSH values were unaffected (35).",
            "Pluim et  al. (36) found an elevation on total T4 and TSH but not on total T3 due to background PCDD/PCDF concentrations in newborns (n = 38), which indicates an agonistic mech- anism of action.",
            "PCBs should mobilize col- loid-stored T4 in the thyroid gland, which could lead to rising T4 levels in serum.",
            "Our finding of an association between the mono-ortho congener PCB 118 and increas- ing TSH (Table 5) agrees with some of these results.",

            "A study on 12 hospitalized children aged 7-14, who had elevated blood lipid concentrations of f-hexachlorocyclohexane, DDE, and PCB, could not reveal any associations to hormone status of total T4 and TSH (372.",
            "In summary, this investigation in ele- mentary schoolchildren supports the hypothesis that PCBs and cadmium can have a mutable or even detrimental effect on levels of thyroid hormones, with lower FT3 and an increase in TSH.",
            "Because of possible adverse effects on growth and development (38) and to identify susceptible periods, there is a need for future studies to analyze the effect of PCB and cadmium on thyroid hormones in different age groups and to observe levels of thyroid hormones in con- nection with the neurologic development of children exposed to PCB and cadmium.",

            "During the period of maximum difference in rates between the two communities (1958)(1959)(1960)(1961), Antofagasta had an excess rate of approximately 20 late fetal deaths, 24 neonatal deaths, and 24 post- neonatal deaths per 1,000 births (Table 3).",
            "The total estimated excess of 68 deaths per thousand births is equivalent to approximate- ly 770 of the 1,900 combined late fetal and infant deaths which occurred during that time period.",
            "Subsequent to 1974, mortality rates exhibit a more gradual decline and are very similar between the two communities.",
            "Results from the Poisson regression analysis of the rates of late fetal, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality are given in Table 4.",
            "We observed significantly elevated RRs for high arsenic exposure in association with each of the three mortality outcomes, after adjustment for location and calendar time.",
            "The association between arsenic exposure and late fetal mortality exhibited the strongest association (RR = 1.72; CI, 1.54-1.93), with neonatal mortality (RR = 1.53; CI, 1.40-1.66), and postneonatal mortality (RR = 1.26; CI, 1.18-1.34) also yielding elevated RRs, respectively.",
            "The variable for location demonstrated a significant association with each outcome, although the magnitude was less than that between arsenic exposure and each outcome.",
            "The rate ratios for the 4-year calendar groups exhibited the predictable secular declines over time.",
            "Discussion",
            "The results of this study indicate that expo- sure to inorganic arsenic from public water supplies may be associated with an increased risk of infant mortality.",
            "Specifically, the data suggest that arsenic exposure may represent a greater risk for late fetal mortality with a lower, but still elevated, risk for neonatal and postneonatal mortality.",
            "This association was evident after controlling for geographic location and calendar time in Poisson regression models.",
            "The mortality rates in both Antofagasta and Valparaiso reflect the well-established decline in late fetal, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality that occurred in Chile over the study period (57.",
            "Improvement in the standard of living, development of pro- grams for maternal and infant care (prenatal, nutritional supplementation, and health education, among others), and the decrease in birth rate are considered the primary fac- tors accounting for the substantial improve- ment in infant mortality rates during this period (56,58,59).",
            "The steeper decline in postneonatal mortality supports these changing patterns of infant mortality because diar- rheal infections and other childhood diseases that are much less fatal under improved health and living conditions are common throughout the first year of life.",
            "&Mortality rates were calculated per 1,000 live births for neonatal and postneonatal period, and per 1,000 total births (live + late fetal) for the late fetal period.",
            "Although both Antofagasta and Val- paraiso experienced substantial improve- ments in their overall infant mortality rates over the study period, the pattern of infant mortality for these two communities was quite different before the 1970s.",
            "Antofagasta exhibited marked increases in late fetal, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality in 1958-1961.",
            "As compared to Valparaiso, these rates remained elevated until 1974-1977 for late fetal mortality, and until 1970-1973 for neonatal and postneonatal mortality.",
            "The pattern of increase and subsequent decline in Antofagasta's mortality rates show a close temporal relationship with the rather sudden and sharp rise in the levels of arsenic in the city's public water supply from 1958 until March 1970, when an arsenic-removal facility was installed, and suggest a possible role for inorganic arsenic in the observed increase in infant mortality.",
            "As in the rest of the country, the decline in mortality rates in Antofagasta during the overall study period was likely a result of other nonarsenic-related factors such as improvement in health care and standard of living, which affected all of the regions in Chile.",
            "Moreover, starting in the 1960s, Region II, which includes the city of Anto- fagasta, experienced a surge of economic expansion, with a rate of growth and devel- opment greatly surpassing that of the rest of the country: the increase in adjusted annual per-capita income was greater by far in Region II than any other region (60).",
            "This expansion brought improvements in region- al health care as well, which may explain, at least in part, the fact that in the period before 1958 Antofagasta had higher late fetal and infant mortality rates than Val- paraiso, whereas after 1970 the rates declined to comparable levels between the two towns.",
            "It appears that the increase in arsenic in the water supply served to delay the improvement in fetal and infant health until the arsenic-removal plant was installed (Figures 345).",
            "The results of this study should be considered within the context of limitations in the study design and in the type of data obtained.",
            "In general, ecologic studies are susceptible to biases that pertain to the lack of individual data on exposure, outcomes, and confounders.",
            "These biases, known as the ecologic fallacy, have been discussed in detail elsewhere (61).",
            "In this study, although expo- sure was measured at the group level, public water was consumed by most residents in each of the communities, the water supply came from one main source at each location, and we adjusted for community differences in the model.",
            "However, we lacked data on individual-level confounders, and therefore we cannot definitely exclude the possibility of an ecologic bias.",
            "Nevertheless, the distinct temporal pattern of infant mortality rates in Antofagasta as compared to Valparaiso argues against this bias.",
            "That is, residual confounding from factors not available would have to closely relate to the timing of the high arsenic exposure documented in Antofagasta.",
            "The change in the arsenic level of the water supply was an indisputable event, and no other environmental pollutant has been described to account for the many documented health effects experienced by the population of Antofagasta during the study time period (8,20,44,46,(62)(63)(64)(65).",
            "Thus, it would not be surprising if these reproductive events were also due to the con- sumption of water with high arsenic.",
            "The underascertainment of both birth and death registrations is typically a poten- tial concern of studies of this design.",
            "With regard to birth registration, there is evidence of underascertainment, which has substantially declined over time.",
            "In Chile, children whose births are not registered by March of the year after they were born are categorized separately.",
            "A study of birth registrations from 1955-1988 showed variations ranging from 11.4 to 4.2% in late birth registrations (66).",
            "We also observed variations between regions; Antofagasta and Valparaiso were consistently among those with the lowest late registration rates.",
            "The increase in births that occur in hospitals (42.3% in 1953 vs.  99.7% in 1994) and births assisted by medical professionals (57.5% in 1953 vs. 100% in 1994) also impacts the completeness of birth registration.",
            "Regional statistics show that Antofagasta and Valparaiso were two of the four provinces with the highest percentage of physician-assisted births in 1953, compared to the rest of Chile (6/).",
            "Death registration is also characterized by omissions, especially for newborns that died in the first hours or days after birth.",
            "A study conducted in Santiago in 1968-1969 showed that over one-half of the hospitalborn babies who died were not registered (68).",
            "Another study in Santiago found that 13% of the deaths of children younger than 5 years of age (69) were not registered, and most of this underregistration occurred for deaths in the neonatal period.",
            "In Chile, the certification of infant deaths by a physician increased from 55% in 1952 (68) to 96% in 1994 (58).",
            "The omissions in death reporting and the late birth registrations affect mortali- ty rates, which will be biased up or down depending on whether birth or death omis- sions were higher.",
            "However, given the much greater number of births than deaths, under- reporting of deaths will have a much greater effect on the rates.",
            "In a study of 1976-1978 mortality by region, medical certification was used as an indirect measure of relative accuracy in the reporting of death (69,70).",
            "Antofagasta and Valparaiso were among the few provinces with < 5% of deaths lacking medical certificates (69,70).",
            "There is no evi- dence that underreporting was significantly different between the two study areas, but we did not find any published report with specific comparisons of fetal and infant mor- tality omissions by geographical locations across time.",

            "For exam- ple, differences in exposures to pesticides or other metals could have an effect on infant mortality.",
            "Although we do not have specific information on pesticides, their use has been historically very limited in the Antofagasta region because it is a desert area with only local small-scale agriculture.",
            "On the contrary, the Valparaiso region is one of the most pro- ductive agricultural areas of the country.",
            "If pesticide exposure increased infant mortality, it would tend to increase the rates in Valparaiso so that the true RRs due to arsenic could be higher than those observed.",
            "On the other hand, the Antofagasta region has a his- tory of mining and smelting that could have the opposite effect.",
            "However, most exposed activities are not close to the city of Antofagasta.",
            "Most importantly, it is unlikely that the clear sharp increase in arsenic water levels, followed by the decrease 12 years later with the installation of the arsenic-removal plant, would be accompanied by another contaminant with a similar temporal pattern.",
            "Summary and Recommendations",
            "Although there is suggestive evidence for arsenic-related human developmental toxici- ty, the existing literature falls short of establishing a clear causal association between environmental arsenic exposure and repro- ductive health effects.",
            "The findings presented in this paper, albeit not definitive, support a role for arsenic in the increased late fetal and infant mortality observed in Antofagasta.",
            "Further studies are needed to investigate the broad range of reproductive and develop- mental effects, ranging from low birth weight to infant death, that may be causally related to arsenic in environmentally exposed populations around the world.",
            "The study designs of these investigations should consider using defined populations, with individual-level data and well-delineated methods of exposure assessment for arsenic and collection of data for potential confounding variables.",
            "Results from the present study, the prospective cohort study under way in Chile by our group, and additional studies of this nature are important in the context of the ongoing review of the arsenic drinking water standard.",

            "A collaborative study to measure interlaboratory variation in scoring chromosome aberrations between 5 Nordic cytogenetic laboratories ( BROGGER et al. 1984) showed that our group tended to score the highest number of aberrations in all the preparations circulated.",
            "We therefore feel confident in our conclusion that there is no scorable effect on chromosome breakage and SCE's at the low doses of styrene under investigation.",

            "Compared with other Nordic laboratories (BR0GGER et d. 1984), we rather score a high number of gaps, which probably means that we are scoring irregularities and clear spots in the chromatids, which other observers would not consider to be true gaps.",
            "Even so we believe that this cannot be the reason for the difference between the exposed and the control groups.",
            "Other scorers might have found a similar difference, but with lower numbers of aberrations.",

            "With the Wilcoxon two-sample ranking test on the same material, the increase in gaps was significant only on the 7.5 % level, however, and no difference could be detected between the two groups of workers.",
            "When the Fisher-Irwin significance test is applied, the exact values of the observations are used in the calculations, while the results from workers and controls are ranked in increasing order in the Wilcoxon ranking test and each value is given a number.",
            "Thus, with the latter method the effects of extreme values are minimized.",
            "If we consider that the few observed extreme values could be caused by some other factors than the exposure under investigation, the Wilcoxon rank-ing test will give a more correct picture of the effect of the exposure.",
            "If, on the other hand, the extreme values are revealing individual variation in response to exposure, it would be more correct to use the Fisher-Irwin test.",
            "Accordingly, the present results may indicate an increase in number of gaps at low levels of exposure to styrene, but no increase in number of breaks.",
            "This is in accordance with the findings of ANDERSON and RICHARDSON (198 1).",
            "They found that gaps alone were produced in rat bone-marrow after exposure to low doses of known clastogenes.",
            "The suggestion that gaps are at least a measure of exposure to a genotoxic agent and may be a useful parameter in genotoxicology in testing low dose levels (BR0GGER 1982), seems to be supported by the present results.",
            "In our study of PVC plant workers (HANSTEEN et al. 1978) the numbers of chromosome breaks were significantly increased in the workers compared with the controls, but significantly more gaps were scored in the control groups than in the workers (unpublished results).",
            "The control group consisted of office employees working on the plant premises.",
            "They may therefore be exposed to low levels of background exposure which may not result in an increase in breaks, but in gaps, while the gaps may have been converted to breaks in the PVC workers who were exposed to high levels of VCM.",
            "This suggestion is supported by the findings of MOORE (1981).",
            "Adding gaps and breaks together as suggested by ANDERSON and RICHARDSON (198 1) would have failed to reveal any difference between the PVC workers and their controls. Great",

            "A characteristic pathological reaction to intratracheal instillation, pharyngeal aspiration, or inhalation of carbon nanotubes is formation of epithelioid granulomas accompanied by interstitial fibrosis in the lungs.",
            "In the mesothelium, a similar response is induced by high aspect ratio nanomaterials, including asbestos fibers, following intraperitoneal injection.",
            "This asbestos-like behaviour of some engineered nanomaterials is a concern for their potential adverse health effects in the lungs and mesothelium.",
            "We hypothesize that high aspect ratio nanomaterials will induce epithelioid granulomas in nonadherent macrophages in 3D cultures.",
            "Results",
            "Carbon black particles (Printex 90) and crocidolite asbestos fibers were used as well-characterized reference materials and compared with three commercial samples of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).",
            "Doses were identified in 2D and 3D cultures in order to minimize acute toxicity and to reflect realistic occupational exposures in humans and in previous inhalation studies in rodents.",
            "Under serum-free conditions, exposure of nonadherent primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages to 0.5 \u03bcg/ml (0.38 \u03bcg/cm2) of crocidolite asbestos fibers or MWCNTs, but not carbon black, induced macrophage differentiation into epithelioid cells and formation of stable aggregates with the characteristic morphology of granulomas.",
            "Formation of multinucleated giant cells was also induced by asbestos fibers or MWCNTs in this 3D in vitro model.",
            "After 7-14 days, macrophages exposed to high aspect ratio nanomaterials co-expressed proinflammatory (M1) as well as profibrotic (M2) phenotypic markers.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Induction of epithelioid granulomas appears to correlate with high aspect ratio and complex 3D structure of carbon nanotubes, not with their iron content or surface area.",
            "This model offers a time- and cost-effective platform to evaluate the potential of engineered high aspect ratio nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes, nanofibers, nanorods and metallic nanowires, to induce granulomas following inhalation.",
            "Background",
            "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a commercial success of nanotechnology with an expanding global market and potential applications for biomedical devices, imaging, drug delivery, tumor targeting, electronics, composite materials and sensing applications.",
            "The continued economic success of this industry is threatened by uncertainty and controversy surrounding potential adverse environmental and human health effects of engineered nanomaterials.",
            "CNTs have been shown to induce significant toxicity using in vitro cellular assays and several in vivo rodent bioassays.",
            "In rodent bioassays using intratracheal instillation or pharyngeal aspiration, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) produced significant lung injury, epithelioid granulomas, and persistent interstitial inflammation and fibrosis.",
            "Granulomas are aggregates of epithelioid macrophages elicited by biopersistent irritants or microorganisms that are not killed during the acute inflammatory response.",
            "Two major types of granulomas are non-immune or foreign body granulomas (FBG) and antigenic or immunologic granulomas.",
            "Foreign body granulomas are characterized by aggregated epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells.",
            "If the stimulus is biopersistent, granulomas may persist for months or years and lead to tissue destruction and fibrosis.",
            "A major controversy in nanotoxicology is whether the observed induction of lung inflammation and fibrosis following the bolus delivery of MWCNTs by intratracheal instillation or pharyngeal aspiration is an artifact associated with agglomeration of the carbon nanotubes prior to administration.",
            "However, a recent inhalation study and a pharyngeal aspiration study using commercial samples of well-dispersed MWCNTs also induced significant lung inflammation characterized by multifocal granulomas.",
            "The specific physicochemical properties of carbon nanotubes responsible for lung toxicity are unknown.",
            "It is uncertain whether these pathologic responses are due to bioavailable metal catalyst residues, graphitic or amorphous carbon residues, length, geometry, high surface area, three-dimensional structure, agglomeration state, or some unique property of the carbon nanotube graphenic surface.",
            "There are numerous animal models of immune-mediated granulomas.",
            "In vitro models of immune-mediated granulomas have been induced by exposure of macrophages to pathogens or pathogen-coated beads.",
            "Macrophages exposed to heat-killed Candida albicans , Mycobacterium sp., parasites such as Nippostrongylus brasiliensis , or antigens from Schistosoma sp. eggs bounded to 45 \u03bcm latex beads, produce granulomas in vitro.",
            "Although non-degradable particles such as latex or dextran beads can induce foreign body or non-immune granulomas in monolayer cultures of macrophages, there is no in vitro model that recreates granuloma formation induced by biopersistent, high aspect ratio nanomaterials.",
            "To comply with a mandate issued by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to replace animal testing with high-throughput in vitro cellular assays based on mechanistic pathways, we have developed a novel in vitro granuloma model.",
            "In this model, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) are cultured in a chemically-defined, serum-free medium as 3-dimensional spheroids in agarose wells.",
            "Cells maintain viability and macrophage phenotypic characteristics when exposed to sub-lethal doses of particulates up to14 days.",
            "Validation of this model for granuloma formation was done using carbon black particles (Printex 90) and crocidolite asbestos fibers as negative and positive reference materials, respectively, as recommended by an ILSI Working Group.",

            "Cellular activation in 3D cultures in response to particulates",
            "Following exposure to microorganisms, macrophages undergo classical activation (M1 or pro-inflammatory phenotype) or differentiation towards alternatively activated macrophages (M2 or pro-fibrotic phenotype).",
            "Prototypical markers of the M1 phenotype include proinflammatory mediators including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, and up-regulated iNOS expression.",
            "The anti-inflammatory or profibrotic M2 phenotype is characterized by induction of arginase-1 (Arg-1) and increased synthesis and release of mannose receptor (MR/CD206).",
            "First, we determined the ability of 2D and 3D cultures of macrophages to express a pro- or anti-inflammatory response by exposure to 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or 20 ng/ml of IL-4 and IL-13, respectively (Additional file 2).",
            "LPS induced TNF-\u03b1 release, iNOS expression, and decreased MR expression (Additional file 2 Figure S1).",
            "IL-4 or IL-13 induced Arg-1 expression, as well as expression and release of both MR and YM-1 (Additional file 2 Figure S2).",
            "Although the ability of macrophages to respond towards a pro- or anti-inflammatory stimulus under 2D or 3D conditions is not impaired, we were unable to detect significant differences in the levels of these inflammatory mediators using ELISA (TNF-\u03b1) or Western blot assays (iNOS and Arg-1) when macrophages were exposed to 0.5 \u03bcg/ml of particulates compared to untreated cells.",
            "Additionally, no significant differences in IL-1\u03b2 release were detected following exposure to these reference and test particulate materials at the sublethal doses used in these experiments in the absence of priming by LPS or phorbol ester (Additional file 3).",
            "To evaluate whether high aspect ratio nanomaterials induce markers of M1 (iNOS, TNF-\u03b1) or M2 activation (Arg-1, MR), the kinetics of macrophage activation induced in 3D cultures following exposure to 0.5 \u03bcg/ml of particulates were determined in situ using dual immunofluorescence imaging and confocal microscopy (Figure 7 and 8).",
            "Compared to untreated cells, exposure to asbestos or MWCNTs induced an early increase in TNF-\u03b1 expression and decreased expression of MR between 1 and 3 days.",
            "After day 7, this activation phenotype changes with variable TNF-\u03b1 expression and increased MR expression following exposure to all particulates (Figure 7).",
            "Exposure to asbestos or MWCNTs in 3D cultures also induces early iNOS expression after 3 - 7 days, followed by a progressive increase in Arg-1 expression (Figure 8).",
            "Induction of both iNOS and Arg-1 in untreated cells or cells exposed to carbon black was also evident at later time points but to a lesser extent than asbestos or MWCNT-treated cells (Figure 8).",
            "Phenotypic heterogeneity is evident following all exposures.",
            "The kinetics of expression of different phenotypic markers is not identical for all markers evaluated: TNF-\u03b1 expression is upregulated prior to increased MR expression and no co-localization of these markers is observed (Figure 7).",
            "In contrast, iNOS expression increases early and is prolonged with a gradual transition to increasing Arg-1 co-expression between 7-14 days.",
            "Untreated cells or cells exposed to carbon black showed low levels of Arg-1 expression (Figure 8).",
            "This phenotypic heterogeneity and co-expression of M1 and M2 markers by a subset of macrophages following exposure to asbestos or MWCNTs is similar to the complex phenotype shown by murine macrophages isolated from healing wounds.",

            "Following exposure to 0.5 \u03bcg/ml for 14 days in 3D cultures, limited agglomeration of carbon black particles is evident in comparison with submicron and micron-sized agglomerates of asbestos fibers and MWCNTs (Figure 9).",
            "Discussion",
            "This in vitro model of granuloma formation uses murine BMDM differentiated in vitro using macrophage colony stimulation factor (M-CSF) (Additional file 4 Table S1)",
            "The phenotype of these differentiated cells resembles mature circulating blood monocytes (Additional file 4 Figure S1).",
            "These cells are recruited into the lungs or the peritoneal cavity in response to particulate stimuli following an early influx of neutrophils.",
            "If the particulate stimulus is toxic and biopersistent, these elicited macrophages may further differentiate into epithelioid macrophages and form a granuloma.",
            "Activation of BMDM and formation of stable aggregates with the morphological features of a foreign body or non-immune granuloma are successfully reproduced in this serum-free, in vitro model only in response to high aspect ratio nanomaterials, not to spherical carbon black particles that have chemically similar surfaces, also composed of sp2-hybridized (graphenic) carbon.",
            "The relative ranking of these materials for induction of granulomas in this 3D models is: MWCNT 3 > asbestos > MWCNT 1, MWCNT 2 > carbon back.",
            "Surface area is not a major determinant of granuloma formation in this data set because the MWCNT 2 with a surface area of 200 m2/g did induce granuloma formation while carbon black nanoparticles with a surface area of 300 m2/g did not.",
            "Epithelioid granulomas are a prominent feature of the lung pathology induced in the first intratracheal instillation studies using carbon nanotubes.",
            "Initially, this lesion was interpreted as an artifact due to bolus instillation of agglomerated carbon nanotubes.",
            "Later studies using pharyngeal aspiration of SWCNTs also induced scattered foci of granulomatous inflammation as well as fibrosis.",
            "This in vitro model of granuloma formation used well-dispersed samples of asbestos fibers and three commercial types of MWCNTs as illustrated in Figure 2.",
            "Within 3-7 days after exposure, macrophages in 3D culture formed stable aggregates with the morphological features of an epithelioid granuloma.",
            "These pathological lesions (Figure 10) are morphologically identical to granulomas induced in mice following pharyngeal aspiration of MWCNTs that are identical to sample 3 used in this in vitro model.",
            "In this in vivo study, the MWCNTs were well-dispersed in synthetic lung lining fluid.",
            "Ma-Hock et al. also delivered well-dispersed MWCNT to rats by inhalation and induced multifocal granulomas, even at a dose of 0.1 mg/m3 for 13 weeks.",
            "During in vitro exposure in this 3D model, all of the nanomaterials underwent agglomeration (Figure 9), especially MWCNT 3 as illustrated in Figure 10.",
            "This phenomenon may be driven by several events leading to entangled fibrous agglomerates that persist after the cells are lysed.",
            "First, internalization of materials may lead to intracellular aggregation during phagocytosis.",
            "Second, over time, macrophages may undergo repeated cycles of phagocytosis and cell death, resulting in extracellular release and accumulation of agglomerated fibrous nanomaterials.",
            "High aspect ratio nanoparticles also induce frustrated phagocytosis and formation of multinucleated giant cells similar to the response of macrophages to asbestos fibers or carbon nanotubes following pharyngeal aspiration or intraperitoneal or pleural injection.",
            "Similar to the study by Poland et al., this in vitro model used a range of commercial MWCNT samples with an iron content of < 0.1 - 1.8 wt-%; however, these samples induced granulomas to the same extent as crocidolite asbestos, the positive reference sample, with an iron content of 22%.",
            "Porter et al. used the same MWCNT as our sample 3 and did not detect generation of hydroxyl radical using electron spin resonance (ESR).",
            "Although redox activity of commercial carbon nanotubes is lower than that of amphibole asbestos fibers, this does not rule out a role for secondary generation of ROS by macrophages during phagocytosis of high aspect ratio nanomaterials.",
            "The phenotype of BMDM induced by exposure of 3D cultures to asbestos fibers or MWCNTs also recapitulates the proinflammatory response of macrophages following inhalation of asbestos fibers.",
            "For example, inhalation of chrysotile or crocidolite asbestos by rats increased formation of nitrotyrosine in alveolar macrophages and other target cells of the lungs and pleura suggesting induction of iNOS similar to this in vitro model.",
            "Asbestos fibers delivered by inhalation to the lungs or by intraperitoneal injection to the mesothelium elicit an acute inflammatory response due to the proinflammatory mediators produced by resident macrophages.",
            "Intratracheal instillation of asbestos fibers or MWCNTs in rats stimulated TNF-\u03b1 release relative to ultrafine carbon black particles.",
            "In this in vitro model, asbestos fibers and MWCNTs also upregulated TNF-\u03b1 protein expression in comparison to carbon black three days after exposure (Figure 7).",
            "The proinflammatory mediators TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and iNOS have also been observed during the formation of immune granulomas in vivo  and in vitro .",
            "Less is known about the mediators involved in production and healing of non-immune granulomas.",
            "Non-immune or foreign body granulomas in the lung may progress to local fibrosis similar to the reaction to well-dispersed MWCNTs delivered to the lungs of rodents by pharyngeal aspiration.",
            "The phenotype of activated macrophages in non-immune granulomas has not been characterized; however, arginase-1, a marker of M2 macrophage activation, is induced after 10-14 days following exposure to asbestos or MWCNTs in this in vitro model (Figure 8).",
            "Induction of arginase-1 is associated with a profibrotic phenotype and may be useful as a biomarker to predict potential fibrosis induced by high aspect ratio nanoparticles.",
            "Co-expression of proinflammatory as well as profibrotic phenotypic markers by epithelioid macrophages may be responsible for sustained inflammation and rapid development of fibrosis induced by MWCNTs in the lungs of rodents.",
            "The biological mechanisms responsible for formation of stable aggregates of macrophages elicited from circulating blood monocytes in non-immune granulomas are unknown.",
            "Differentiation of monocytes into epithelioid macrophages is a morphological feature of granulomas.",
            "Epithelioid cells are large cells characterized by abundant endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, lysosomes, and cytoplasmic vesicles and vacuoles.",
            "Interdigititation of long, surface microvilli may be responsible for stable adhesion of epithelioid cells and they are the ultrastructural hallmark of granulomas; these morphological features are produced by exposure to asbestos fibers or MWCNTs, but not to carbon black (Figure 4).",
            "The complex 3D aggregate structure (Figure 1C) characteristic of these commercial carbon nanotube samples may promote macrophage aggregation and granuloma formation in vitro and in vivo.",
            "A major caveat in in vitro nanotoxicology assays is the high dose delivered to target cells that may not reflect human exposure under realistic conditions.",
            "In this in vitro model, 1.4 \u00d7 105 BMDM were exposed to 0.05-0.5 \u03bcg of test particulates.",
            "Elder et al. established a subchronic NOAEL for Printex 90, the carbon black sample used in this in vitro study, and determined that approximately 0.1 mg was deposited in the lungs of rats after 13 weeks inhalation at a dose of 1 mg/m3.",
            "Assuming 3 \u00d7 107 alveolar macrophages per rat, the dose used in this in vitro assay is close to the deposited dose of carbon black under conditions that do not induce impaired clearance or inflammation.",
            "For comparison, airborne dust levels of MWCNTs measured by Han et al. in a research facility were 400 \u03bcg/m3 and this dose corresponded to the doses delivered to mice by pharyngeal aspiration that produced lung granulomas and diffuse interstitial fibrosis.",
            "Conclusion",
            "The distinctive morphological and phenotypic responses of BMDM to reference particulates and MWCNTs in serum-free 3D culture establish proof-of-principle for this in vitro model as a potential alternative to both traditional 2D monolayer cultures and to rodent bioassays for granuloma formation.",
            "This in vitro 3D model is a promising platform for testing of various commercial varieties of carbon nanotubes as well as other new high aspect ratio or one-dimensional nanomaterials including metallic nanowires, and ZnO or TiO2 nanorods and nanobelts",

            "Accordingly, the slow NAT2 phenotype, which arises as a consequence of point mutations in an intron-less gene, has long been associated with increased bladder cancer risk [7]; and more recently, cigarette smokers who are slow NAT2 and rapid CYPlA2 were found to possess the highest level of AAhemoglobin adducts [8].",
            "In comparison to the AAs, the activation and detoxification pathways for PAHs in relation to urinary bladder carcinogenesis are less clear.",
            "However, benzo[a]pyrene (BP) is metabolized by cultured human bladder systems [9] and its metabolism in other human tissues such as lung and larnyx is consistent with the initial formation of BP-7,Sdiol and 9-hydroxy-BP and their subsequent conversion to DNA-reactive bay-region diol-epoxides and K-region oxides (Fig. 2).",
            "CYPs lA1, 2C9, and 3A4 have each been shown to catalyze these oxidative reactions in human tissues (reviewed in [lo]); while glutathione Stransferases (GSTs) serve an important role in the detoxification of the arene oxides.",

            "Since previous studies have indicated that hepatic NAT2 activity is an important detoxitlcation step for bladder carcinogenesis and individuals with slow NAT2 genotype were found to be at higher risk for bladder cancer [16], one would predict that individuals who possess a slow NA T2 and the rapid NA Tl *lo genotypes would be at highest risk of developing this type of neoplasm.",
            "Indeed, this combined genotype (slow NA T2INA Tl VU) indeed exhibited the highest carcinogen-DNA adduct level in our study.",
            "Moreover, slow NAT2 phenotype and rapid CYPlA2 have been implicated in the activation (N-oxidation) and detoxification (N-acetylation) of AAs for human bladder carcinogenesis.",
            "In conclusion, these data provide the first evidence for phenotypic and genotypic polymorphisms in both NAT1 and NAT2 and a phenotypic polymorphism in the metabolic activation of BP that are predictive of DNA adduct levels in the human urinary bladder.",
            "Moreover, the enzyme which has long been thought to be responsible for monomorphic NAT1 activity, is shown to be regulated by a polymorphic gene, NAT& and it is bimodally distributed in the human urinary bladder in a manner that is significantly correlated with the DNA adduct levels found in this tissue.",
            "Together with the known polymorphisms for NAT2, CYPlAl, CYPlA2, GSTMl and sulfotransferase, it is evident that metabolic phenotypes/genotypes can significantly influence DNA adduct formation in urothelial cells and could ultimately lead to a wide variation in urinary bladder cancer risk.",

            "This increase has mainly been due to an increase in adenocarcinomas, but there has also been some increase in squamous cell cancers both in Britain (Powell and Allum, 1992;Dodaran et al, 2001), and in Scotland where increases in incidence have recently been observed in both subtypes for men and women (McKinney et al, 1995;Brewster et al, 2000).",

            "We have already reported the results for adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus (Cheng et al, 2000), which suggested that high body mass index (BMI) and low consumption of fruit were associated with an increased risk, and that there was a protective effect of breastfeeding.",

            "Where there was a significant interaction this was also adjusted for in the multivariate analysis.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Of 416 eligible patients with any histological type of oesophageal cancer, 256 (62%) were interviewed.",
            "The response rate for firstchoice controls was 65%.",
            "There were 159 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, 86 in the English centres and 73 in Scotland.",
            "Cases were slightly more likely to be of lower social class and to have had no further training after leaving school than controls (Table 1) but neither trend was statistically significant.",
            "Cases were slightly less likely than controls to be married or living as married.",
            "The dietary factors (Table 2) associated with a significantly decreased odds ratio (OR) were eating a 'light' breakfast (defined as other than the traditional British cooked breakfast) (adjusted OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.48), and eating salads (trend with increasing salad consumption P = 0.005; adjusted OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20-0.92 in the highest quartile of consumption).",
            "A slimming diet, and meal patterns (classed as nutritionally good, moderate, or bad), total fruit and fruit juice consumption all showed an association with squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus in the unadjusted analysis which disappeared after adjustment.",
            "Quantity of tea consumed was of borderline significance in the adjusted analysis (highest tertile vs never/<1 decilitre per day OR = 3.36, 95% CI 0.99-11.29, P for trend = 0.052).",
            "There was a significant increasing trend in risk with increasing temperature at which tea or coffee is drunk (P = 0.03).",
            "Alcohol consumption was unrelated to squamous cell cancer.",
            "There were positive trends with total years of smoking and pack years of smoking (Table 2).",
            "Reproductive variables (number of children, breast feeding) were unrelated to risk of squamous cell carcinoma (data not shown).",
            "Of the medical and drug history items (which included anaemia, diabetes, indigestion, obesity, ingestion of chemicals and laxative use), none showed any effect on risk apart from aspirin which showed a protective effect.",
            "Based on 10 (6.3%) cases and 19 (12.0%) controls reporting daily use of aspirin for at least a month, there was a significant interaction between aspirin and centre.",
            "The protective effect was significant only for the English centres (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.56 for the English centres and OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.21-2.94 for Scotland).",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "An important finding in this study of squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus in women is that alcohol consumption is not a major risk factor.",
            "Levels of alcohol consumption in this study were relatively low with only 5% of control women and 7% of cases reporting consumption greater than the recommended weekly limit for women of 14 units.",
            "In studies largely conducted among men in Western Europe and North America, it has been estimated that at least 90% of the risk of oesophageal cancer can be attributed to alcohol and tobacco consumption, and risks associated with alcohol consumption are greater than those associated with smoking (see Mu\u00f1oz and Day, 1996 and references therein).",
            "The possibility cannot be excluded that the participants in our study under-reported their alcohol intake.",
            "We attempted to minimise potential for differential and non-differential under-reporting.",
            "Participants were not made aware that one of the study hypotheses pertained to alcohol.",
            "Our trained study interviewers used a structured interview schedule to obtain information on alcohol intake from cases and controls.",
            "Therefore it seems unlikely that there would have been under-reporting of sufficient magnitude to entirely account for our null finding.",
            "Smoking and alcohol are frequently correlated but in the absence of any effect for alcohol, risks were clearly increased for women who smoked.",
            "A dose-response effect was evident, with a 2-to 3-fold increase in risk for the highest levels of consumption.",
            "In England a decrease in cigarette smoking for men is not paralleled by a decrease in women (Department of Health, 1998) and therefore the risk of oesophageal cancer in this population is likely to remain high.",
            "Recent data from Scotland show that the proportion of women who smoked in 1998 (33%) was lower than in 1995 (36%) (Boreham, 2000) indicating that risk is likely to diminish in this population.",
            "However a strong association between lower social class and high levels of smoking may mean that for those in the more deprived groups with poor levels of nutrition the risk of oesophageal cancer may still be raised.",
            "There is substantial evidence for an association between nutritional factors and oesophageal cancer (Cheng and Day, 1996).",
            "Our finding of a protective effect of a light breakfast as well as for fruit consumption may be a marker of a 'healthy' diet.",
            "However, our results also suggest that having some kind of breakfast is better   than having none at all, so another explanation might be that eating breakfast has some physiological effect which results in a reduced risk of developing this tumour.",
            "One such possibility could be the effect of food on morning gastric reflux.",
            "These potential explanations for our observation with regard to breakfast are speculative; this issue requires further investigations.",
            "Although the increasing trend in risk with quantity of tea consumed is of borderline significance only, the risks are substantial (over 3-fold at the highest level of consumption), and there is an almost 3-fold greater risk in those who drink beverages 'very or burning' hot compared to warm.",
            "Given the possibility of a large measurement error, the real risks could be substantially larger and taken with the effect of smoking, this seems the most likely explanation of the relatively high rates of squamous cell cancer of the oesophagus in women in the UK compared to other European populations.",
            "In the early 1990s a large prospective study from the US identified a protective effect for gastrointestinal cancers including those of the oesophagus associated with the long-term use of aspirin (Thun et al, 1993).",
            "More recently Langman et al (2000) using data from a UK primary care database, and Farrow et al (1998) in a case-control study in the USA have reported protective effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",
            "Farrow et al found the effect for both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus.",
            "Overall the findings from our study are consistent with this but the negative association is only significant for the English centres.",
            "The reasons for this remain unclear.",
            "We have previously reported a non-significant protective effect with respect to adenocarcinoma (OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.27-1.63) (Cheng et al, 2000).",
            "The question we asked was a simple one relating to ever use of aspirin regularly for a month.",
            "This differs from the definition used by Langman et al which relates to at least 7 prescriptions for antiinflammatory drugs in the 1-3 years prior to diagnosis.",
            "The parallel studies of adenocarcinoma (Cheng et al 2000) and squamous cell carcinoma in the same centres by the same study team provides an opportunity to compare and contrast the findings for each tumour type.",
            "In the final model for squamous cell carcinoma the following variables were statistically significant: type of breakfast; salad consumption; temperature of tea or coffee; total years of smoking and aspirin use, which had a significant interaction with Centre.",
            "The final model for adenocarcinoma showed risk increased significantly with high body mass index at 20 years of age (P for trend = 0.002) and that higher intake of fruit (times per week, P for trend = 0.002) and breastfeeding (P for trend = 0.005) were associated with reduced risk.",
            "This suggests differences in aetiology of the 2 tumour types.",
            "In common is a protective effect of a 'healthy diet' though the significant variables were not identical.",
            "For both a healthy diet might be a good preventive strategy, with weight control also being important in adenocarcinoma.",
            "In squamous cell carcinoma smoking cessation and care not to drink beverages at too high a temperature are additional strategies.",
            "Additionally, if the association with aspirin is a true one, it offers the possibility of an intervention strategy in target populations, such as smokers.",

            "Widespread exposures to organic solvents, pesticides, hair dyes, and other common chemicals have been suggested, and several of these factors have been linked with elevated NHL risk in case-control and other studies (4)(5)(6).",

            "Nine quality-control sets of three samples each were prepared by staff at Johns Hopkins University.",
            "The first sample in each set was a replicate of pooled serum samples collected during the CLUE I survey from 10 persons who resided outside the study area and therefore were not enrolled in the cohort.",

            "A reagent blank to check for contaminants and an internal laboratory quality-control sample (spiked bovine serum) (14) were analyzed with every 10 study serum samples.",
            "Solid-phase extraction was carried out, and each sample was analyzed on two separate gas chromatographs with electron-capture detection.",

            "Questionnaire data that we included in the analysis were as follows: years of education (< 12 years, \u2265 12 years), ever smoked cigarettes (yes/no), and currently smoking cigarettes (yes/no).",
            "We also included variables representing Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) seropositivity and total PCB level (11).",
            "The mean time to diagnosis among the 74 cases, after enrollment in the cohort in 1974, was 12.1 years (SD, 5.2; range, 1-20).",
            "Ninety-nine percent of cases and their 147 matched controls were Caucasian.",
            "Age at enrollment, sex distribution, and smoking habits were similar in each group.",
            "A higher proportion of cases (64%) than controls (50%) were high school graduates (12).",
            "Using results from quality-control serum samples, we calculated interset (analyses conducted on the same day) and intraset (separate days) CVs for six individual organochlorine compounds and a combined group of chlordane-related compounds.",
            "Intraset and interset CVs, respectively, were as follows: \u03b2hexachlorocyclohexane, 0.19 and 0.36; chlordane/heptachlor-related compounds, 0.24 and 0.24; transnonachlor, 0.34 and 0.09; heptachlor epoxide, 0.33 and 0.26; oxychlordane, 0.34 and 0.47; dieldrin, 0.22 and 0.30; and hexachlorobenzene, 0.19 and 0.36.",
            "With minor exception, the levels of these compounds in our quality-control samples were above the limit of detection.",
            "In contrast, more than half the measured values of heptachlor were at or below the nominal detection limit (Table 1), and random variation in the extraction and analytical system contributed proportionally more to the elevated CVs observed.",
            "The intraset and interset CVs for heptachlor were 0.89 and 1.04.",
            "In Table 1, summary data describing organochlorines in sera for cases and the average of the two controls in each set are described by the median value and 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles.",
            "All values are lipid adjusted and corrected for recovery, using factors reported by Brock et al. (14).",
            "In Table 1, we also show results from a comparison of serum levels between cases and controls, using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.",
            "Except for \u03b2-hexachlorocylohexane, there was no significant difference in lipid-adjusted and recovery-corrected level between the case and control series.",
            "The distribution of \u03b2hexachlorocyclohexane was significantly elevated among cases compared with controls.",
            "Odds ratios for increasing levels of organochlorines, stratified by quartile of lipidcorrected and recovery-adjusted level, are shown in Table 2.",
            "The referent level in each instance was the lowest quartile, with the exception of heptachlor, where tertiles were used and all determinations below detection were placed in the referent group.",
            "Confidence intervals included 1.0 for odds ratios of the seven individual compounds that we analyzed, as well as for the grouped chlordane-related compounds.",
            "The trend of risk with increasing level of each organochlorine (or grouped Articles | Cantor et  chlordane-related compounds) did not significantly differ from the null at the p < 0.05 level.",
            "The risk of NHL showed an increase with serum level of hexachlorobenzene that was attenuated when the logistic model was adjusted for serum PCBs, EBV titer, and other factors.",
            "Data were also analyzed without correction for laboratory recovery, with similar results for all odds ratios and tests for trend.",
            "Discussion",
            "In this nested case-control study, we examined the association between risk of NHL and prediagnostic serum levels of several organochlorine compounds.",
            "We found no evidence of association with NHL for any of the compounds we examined: \u03b2-hexachlorocyclohexane, transnonachlor, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane, hexachlorobenzene, dieldrin, or summed chlordane-related compounds (transnonachlor, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, and oxychlordane).",
            "An association with \u03b2-hexachlorocyclohexane observed with a rank sum test between cases and controls was not confirmed by an analysis of the exposure-response relationship.",
            "These data do not support hypotheses of links with these compounds suggested by findings from case reports and interview and body-burden studies of NHL, other hematopoietic cancers, and related hematologic conditions such as aplastic anemia (7,8,16,17).",
            "The null findings reported here pose a striking contrast with our earlier finding in this study population of a strong and consistent association of NHL risk with total serum PCBs (11).",
            "The major strength of this study derives from the prospective collection of biologic samples in a nested case-control design in a general population setting.",
            "Differential bias from cases and controls could not have influenced the result because all sera were obtained and frozen many years before diagnosis, when participants were healthy.",
            "Our analytical method to measure organochlorines was designed to exclude many interfering compounds ( 14), and we corrected for serum lipids as well as compound-specific recovery Articles | Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and serum organochlorines Environmental Health Perspectives efficiencies.",
            "All analyses were performed blindly with respect to case-control status and without knowledge of which samples were included for quality-control purposes.",
            "The serum values of the organochlorine compounds that we measured were comparable with levels found in other U.S. populations, after accounting for decreases in serum concentrations of most compounds since 1974, when our sera were collected (18,19).",
            "It is unlikely that outmigration from the study affected our results.",
            "A systematic sample of 4% of households provided an estimate of 1.5% outmigration per year in the approximate 10-year period between a census held in 1975 and 1 April 1985.",
            "In addition, for outmigration to influence our result, it would have to be differential with respect to future NHL diagnosis as well as serum level of one or more organochlorine compounds.",
            "Despite the unique strengths of this study, interpretation of its generally null results should be tempered by several considerations.",
            "The CVs for the compounds of interest here, derived from randomly inserted quality-control samples, were somewhat larger than we previously found for PCB or DDT/DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) determinations (11).",
            "The variance introduced by the implied measurement error may have contributed to variability in odds ratios, possibly obscuring associations of relatively small magnitude.",
            "We lipid-corrected all organochlorine measures, based on the notion that the compounds of interest are highly lipophilic and that equilibrium is rapidly established between adipose tissue and serum lipid (19).",
            "Finally, it is possible that confounding was present in this study and obscured associations of organochlorines with risk of NHL.",
            "This would be the case if etiologically relevant factors were inversely associated with the organochlorines we examined.",
            "Animal bioassays have indicated the carcinogenicity of several compounds that were the focus of this study.",
            "Using a widely accepted classification scheme, expert committees convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer have cited \"sufficient evidence,\" based on evidence from laboratory animals, for carcinogenicity of chlordane/ heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, \u03b1-hexachlorocyclohexane, and technical grade hexachlorocyclohexane (20,21).",
            "There is \"limited evidence\" for carcinogenicity of dieldrin, \u03b3-hexachlorocyclohexane, and \u03b2-hexachlorocyclohexane (20,21).",
            "Although the epidemiologic evidence is far from definitive, there are suggestions that one or more of these compounds are human carcinogens and may be related to elevated risk of NHL.",
            "Farmers, who have generally elevated exposures to many of the compounds under consideration, are at elevated risk of NHL in many studies (22,23).",
            "Chlordane was linked with NHL in a case-control study in the midwestern United States (9).",
            "Hematopoietic cancer deaths were not in excess in a small cohort of workers employed in the manufacture of chlordane and heptachlor (24).",
            "In a hospital-based study, Hardell et al. (7) found an association of NHL with postdiagnostic adipose tissue levels of six summed chlordane compounds among 27 patients and 17 hospital-based controls, with an especially strong association for transnonachlor.",
            "We were not able to confirm Hardell et al.'s findings in the present population-based study based on prediagnostic serum chlordane among 74 NHL cases and 147 controls.",
            "In our data, serum transnonachlor had a weak negative association with NHL risk.",
            "Hexachlorocyclohexane, produced by photochlorination of benzene, results in \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and other isomers (25).",
            "Lindane, the \u03b3-isomer, is used as an insecticide.",
            "However, little bioaccumulation of lindane occurs.",
            "We detected it in only 5% of serum samples, an insufficient number for statistical analysis.",
            "The \u03b2-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane is more stable.",
            "It bioaccumulates in adipose tissue and was found in more than 90% of our serum samples, with a median concentration among controls of 138.0 ng/g lipid.",
            "Case reports describe the occurrence of aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias after lindane exposure (17,(26)(27)(28).",
            "The carcinogenicity of lindane is less clear in humans than in laboratory animals.",
            "The strength of associations of NHL with lindane exposure, in data pooled from populationbased case-control studies in four midwestern states, were decreased after adjustment for potential confounding from 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and diazinon (29).",
            "The carcinogenicity of the \u03b2-isomer is less clear.",

            "Although cancer mortality has been studied in several occupational groups exposed to aldrin and dieldrin, cohorts were small and the studies lacked sufficient statistical power to observe any but the strongest carcinogenic effects for relatively rare cancers such as NHL (30)(31)(32)(33)(34).",
            "Two small case-control studies of leukemia and lymphoma examined levels of aldrin/dieldrin in the bone marrow at diagnosis, with no observed differences (35,36).",

            "BETEL, TOBACCO, AND CANCER OF THE MOUTH",
            "TOBACCO has been, for many years, under suspicion as a carcinogen.",
            "Pride of place has of late been accorded in the literature to the relationship between bronchial carcinoma and cigarette smoking, but in South India and in those parts of South-East Asia where persons of South Indian stock work, or have settled, oral cancer has long been a problem of importance.",
            "Essentially there are two types of oral cancer; that associated with the chewing of tobacco, usually ad- mixed with some form of betel (vide infra), and that associated with smoked tobacco.",
            "This paper is primarily, but not exclusively, concerned with the former type of tumour, and examines the nature of the betel quid, touches briefly on its complex chemistry and pharmacology, reviews the clinical and experimental evidence pointing to the presence of a carcinogenic agent, probably tobacco, in the quid, and reports experiments in which malignancy was induced in the ears of mice painted for a prolonged period with an aqueous extract of a typical Singapore betel quid.",
            "The Quid: Composition, Chemistry, Pharmacology",
            "The chewing of betel, with or without tobacco, is widespread in the Orient: Ceylon, India, Burma, Siam, Indochina, Malaya, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland, Formosa and China.",
            "The habit is of great antiquity.",
            "The chewing of the areca, or betel, nut is mentioned in the Sanskrit \"Susrata Samhita\" believed to have been written about A.D. 600 near Benares.",
            "The Sanskrit for the leaf of the betel vine \"tambula \", persists in the modern Hindi \"tambuli\" and in the Arabic and Persian \"tambula \".",
            "The Malay \"sireh\" bears no resemblance, but Malay is not of Sanskrit derivation (Burkill, 1935b).",
            "The habit is known to have reached the Zanzibar coast between A.D. 1200-1400 and mention is made in Dutch archives of 1664 of an impost duty on betel leaf imported from India into Malacca.",
            "In 1703 the import was forbidden, presumably to protect local growers, rather than to prevent a well-established habit.",
            "Tobacco is almost never chewed by itself.",
            "In India it is usually mixed, flaked, with cracked, powdered, or sliced dried betel nut (the fruit of the betel palm, Areca catechu), and slaked stone or shell lime, the whole being wrapped in the leaf of the betel vine (Piper betle) on which catechu, an aqueous extract of the heart wood of the acaciae Acacia catechu or Acacia suma has been smeared.",
            "Spices such as cardamom, cloves and aniseed may be added for additional flavour (Sanghvi, Rao, and Khanolkar, 1955).",
            "This quid is inserted in the gingivobuccal fold and chewed for hours (Shanta and Krishnamurthi, 1959).",
            "In Thailand turmeric, the ground root of Curcuma aromatica is usually added to the chew (Ellis, 1921).",
            "The aboriginal Veddas of Ceylon prepare their slaked lime from the shells of snails (Spittel, 1924), and coral is not infrequently used in the Pacific Islands (Eisen, 1946).",
            "While the method of preparation in Malaya and Singapore is essentially similar to that in India, the catechu is exhibited in a rather different form as \"gambir\" (vide infra).",
            "The betel vine is cultivated, the leaves used for chewing being on the hori- zontal upper side branches; the connoisseur's leaf being the largest.",
            "Plucking is done in the early morning, and the leaves are protected from the sun to preserve the aroma.",
            "The leaves are then bleached, the superior quality being very soft and coloured a uniform green yellow (Burkill, 1935b).",
            "This process heightens flavour, which is due to the presence of volatile oils.",
            "The chief of these is eugenol, an unsaturated aromatic phenol, usually very pale yellow in colour, which has a strong pungent odour reminiscent of cloves, and a pungent spicy taste.",
            "This substance has antiseptic and local anaesthetic properties (Weatherby and Haag,  1958).",
            "Chewing a betel leaf for five minutes leaves the mouth rather numb.",
            "Terpenes are also present, these are pungent, and unpleasant if present to excess.",
            "Unusually large amounts of potassium nitrate, and small quantities of sugar, starch and tannin have been found (Mann and Patwardhan, 1916).",
            "The chewed leaf is a gentle stimulant and carminative, sweetening the breath (Burkill, 1 935b).",
            "The areca nut contains many alkaloids; arecoline, arecaine, guvacine, arecolidine, guvacoline, iso-guvacine and choline (Henry, 1949).",
            "Arecoline is the only one of importance, the dried nut containing about 0-1 per cent.",
            "This alkaloid is cholinergic, exerting a sialogogue and diaphoretic action in normal dosage.",
            "Very large amounts depress the central nervous system.",
            "It may exert a deleterious effect on the dental enamel (Riker, 1958).",
            "Also present are tannin, the glycerides of lauric, oleic and myristic acids, and a little sugar.",
            "This nut is sometimes used internally by the Malays as a vermifuge and as a cure for diarrhoea (Burkill, 1935a).",
            "By itself the areca nut is highly acid and astringent to the taste.",
            "The addition of lime not only neutralises this to a large extent, as can easily be demonstrated in vitro, but also promotes the appearance of a red dye.",
            "From the shrub Uncaria gambir the \" getah gambir\" of the Malay, the \"katta kambu\" of the Tamil, is extracted.",
            "The delicacy of flavour of this product depends upon its catechin content.",
            "The leaves are bound, steamed, and then small amounts of boiling water are allowed to trickle through.",
            "On cooling catechin crystallises out, leaving the more soluble, and bitter, catechu tannic acid in solution.",
            "Usually a little bran is added and the bran-catechin mixture made into cakes.",
            "In the production of gambier for tanning a crude process is used, extracting most of the catechu tannic acid (Burkill, 1935c).",
            "Apart then from the tobacco nicotine which may be present in the quid, and which apparently has the same power to effect habituation as that from smoked tobacco, the betel leaf-areca nut-gambir-lime mixture promotes intense salivation (Eisen, 1946), mild exhilaration, and to a certain extent, sleeplessness.",
            "The essential oils give a pleasurable tang and impart a subjective confidence in the the wholesomeness of the exhaled breath.",
            "However, like other habits of a similar nature, betel chewing seems to be an acquired taste, the first chew, whether tobacco is present or not, causing giddiness and nausea.",
            "It should also be noted that the colour red, such a prominent feature of the chewed quid, and of the expectorated mouth juices, connotes good luck to Indians, Chinese and Malays, as well as to other Asian peoples.",
            "Betel chewing is a poor man's luxury, as a made-up betel/tobacco quid costs 5 cents local currency (one penny sterling): this is about the price of a cigarette which lasts for a much shorter time.",
            "Tobacco is smoked in many parts of India in the form of\" bidis \", a variety of cigarette in which dried powdered sun-dried tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum or Nicotiana rusticum) is wrapped in a variety of leaves, usually the dried leaf of the temburni (Diospyros melanoxylon), the whole being secured at one end by a thin string (Sanghvi et al., 1955).",
            "These \" bidis\" are not generally smoked by the Chinese or Malays in Malaya or Singapore, but they are popular with locally domiciled Malayalees and Tamils of Social Class V.",
            "A similar type of smoke is very popular with the Malay, the ' rokok daun\" composed of a thin central core of Siamese tobacco around which is wrapped the leaf of the Nipah palm (Nipah fruticans).",
            "The taxoinomny of the plants menitioned above has been described by Ridley (192 2 -25).",
            "('linical Evidence The mIain interest in betel chewing has, of course, always been directed to its possible relationship with oral cancer.",
            "Many of the early writers held there was no such relationship (Maxwell, 1924;W7ells, 1925), whereas others (Fells,  1908; Bentall, 1908) did.",
            "Davidsoni (1923) and Spittel (1924) pointed out the p9ssible significance of tobacco in the quid.",
            "Most of the confusion arose from a failure to distinguish between betel and betel/tobacco quids.",
            "Ellis (1921) held a survey of medical opinion in Siam, the consensus of which was that there was no such relationship.",
            "However, pursuing the matter further (AMendelson and Ellis, 1924), he showed that in the 24,340 males attending Government clinics in Bangkok in 1922-23 there were 43 cancers, 49 per cent of which were in the mouth, and concluded that betel/tobacco was carcinogenic.",
            "Othlers, such as Davis (1915) writing about lBuyo cancer of the Philippines, held that lime was the active agent.",
            "Clinical evidence has slowly accumulated over the years, successive investigations tending to be more accurate statistically.",
            "Orr (1933 in his classical description of oral cancer in betel/tobacco chewers, examined in detail 100 cases of oral cancer.",
            "Of these, 2 were not chewers, 9 chewed occasionally, 24 chewed from three to five quids a day, 40 chewed more than this number, and 25 slept with a quid in the mouth.",
            "In a control group of persons with no oral cancer correspondinig figures were 34, 31, 23, 10 and 2.",
            "Orr does not state how his control group was selected.",
            "He showed that over twothirds of the cancers involved the site directly irritated.",
            "34 per cenlt of the tuLmours were on the lower alveolus, or between the alveolus and the cheek, 33 per cent involved the cheek alone, 15 per cent the tongue and the floor of the mouth, 10 per cent the upper jaw and palate, and 8 per cent the lips.",
            "He re- marked that the lip tumours seemed to begin just inside the angle of the mouth and wondered if this might be due to the habit of squirting juice out of the corner of the mouth.",
            "Eisen (1946) described betel chewing in the Southwest Pacific Islands.",
            "Here, as well as the areca nut, the leaves and pods of the piper betle are used.",
            "The lime is obtained from sea-shells or from coral.",
            "Tobacco is not used, and cancer of the mouth is virtually unknown: one case in 8000 adults admitted to a New Guinea hospital.",
            "The teeth of these chewers, although stained red, were in good condition, unlike those of the betel/tobacco chewers of Madras (Shanta and  Krishnamurthi, 1959).",
            "That this susceptibility to oral cancer following the chewing of tobacco is environmental rather than racial is adduced from the evidence of Friedell and Rosenthal (1941), who described 8 cases of oral cancer in white American males who habitually chewed tobacco per se.",
            "These tumours arose at the point where the quid was usually placed.",
            "Khanolkar and Suryabai (1945) describe an unusual cancer of the lip asso- ciated with the use of unsmoked tobacco.",
            "This they found particularly prevalent in Bihar, in north-east India, accounting for a minimum of 12.6 per cent of oral carcinomata biopsied.",
            "They noted that patients with this cancer sought treat- ment at such a late date that biopsy was often considered unnecessary.",
            "This undue prevalence they considered was due to the use of \"khaini \", a powdered admixture of dried tobacco leaf and lime.",
            "A pinch of the mixture is deposited in the groove between the front lip and the teeth, being left there, until after dilution by saliva, it is swallowed.",
            "This process is carried out at frequent intervals throughout the day.",
            "Sanghvi et al. (1955) undertook a statistical survey of 1460 patients referred to the Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay, in 1952-54.",
            "Patients referred to this hospital in whom no cancer was detected formed a control group.",
            "Patients were asked whether they smoked\" bidis\" or chewed betel.",
            "It was shown that chewing of betel/tobacco was associated with cancer of the oral cavity; chewing and smoking with tumours of the hypopharynx and base of the tongue; smoking alone with cancers of the oropharynx, notably the tonsil, and the oesophagus.",
            "Shanta and Krishnamurthi (1959) reviewed the 347 oral cancers seen in one year at the Cancer Institute, Madras.",
            "71 per cent of all oral cancers (26.45 per cent of all malignancies) arose from the buccal mucosa, and 22 per cent (8 per cent cent of all malignancies) from the lingual mucosa.",
            "The incidence of cheek cancer was higher in the male; environment, religion, anaemia, syphilis, tuberculosis, diabetes, hypertension, virus diseases and achlorhydria were not of significance.",
            "The habit of chewing tobacco, betel leaf and areca nut was highly significant.",
            "85 per cent of those with a buccal cancer chewed all three, while in the non- cancerous control group the figure was 12.5 per cent.",
            "Only 8.7 per cent. of those with a cancer chewed betel nut and lime alone; of the control group, 51-8 per cent.",
            "Smoking did not appear to be of importance, but gross dental sepsis was considered to be the main factor in the higher incidence of these tumours in the labouring, when compared with the lower middle class.",
            "In carcinomas of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue the same factors held good, although tobacco smoking appeared to play a dominant role in cancers of the posterior third.",
            "Sanghvi et al. (1955) attributed the high incidence of posterior third tumours to the combined habit of smoking \"bidis\" and chewing tobacco.",
            "Another type of cancer associated with smoking is that of the hard palate.",
            "This is for the most part confined to Vizagapatam, and the outlying districts of Andhra Province, which is situated in the mid-eastern part of India.",
            "This cancer is almost certainly due to the smoking of\" chutta \", a local type of cigar made by rolling dried tobacco leaf, which is then tied at the end with a thin piece of string (Khanolkar and Suryabai, 1945).",
            "Such a primitive device is difficult to smoke as the smoke is not easy to draw, the core being very irregular.",
            "As the lighted end goes out easily it is customary to keep it inside the mouth to promote combustion.",
            "For some reason it is only the women who use this \"adda poga \", or reverse smoking, men from the same district, and of the same social standing, smoking the chutta in the orthodox manner (Reddy, Reddy and Rao, 1960).",
            "Experimental Evidence Woelfel, Spies and Cline (1941) tested the ether, alcohol and unsaponifiable fractions of areca nuts on mice, but failed to evoke tumours.",
            "While prolonged subcutaneous injection of tannic acid (tannin, gallotannin) has been shown to produce liver cirrhosis and eventually liver neoplasms, this substance did not evoke local tumours (Korpassy and Mosonyi, 1950).",
            "Although tannin is present in areca nut, and both catechu and catechu tannic acid may both be classed as tainmins, their chemistry is so complex (Nierenstein, 1948) that each substance would need to be tested for carcinogenicity.",
            "To the best of the authors' belief no work has been done on the other constituents of the betel quid apart from tobacco.",
            "Roffo (1939a, 1939b) prepared several distillates of tobacco; a watery extract (100 to 120\u00b0C.), a thicker liquid (120 to 350\u00b0C.), and the residue.",
            "These products were applied daily to the ears of three batches of 20 rabbits for a period of 10 months.",
            "The first distillate evoked no tumours, but 95 per cent of those painted with the second, and 70 per cent of those painted with the residue developed squamous carcinomata.",
            "Sugiura (1940) was unable to confirm these findings using comparable distillates.",
            "Roffo (1941) showed that nicotine alone was not a carcinogen for rabbits.",
            "Extracts of sun-cured Indian chewing tobacco have been prepared by Mody  and Ranadive (1959) and assessed for carcinogenicity by painting the inter- scapular skin and buccal mucosa of Strong (A) and Swiss mice.",
            "Some extracts were screened by the method of Suntzeff, Cowdry and Croninger (1955).",
            "Hyperplasia of the epithelium was noted, but this may have been due to irritation.",
            "After the first month of painting shell lime was added to several of the extracts used on the buccal mucosa, without apparent result.",
            "The insertion of tobacco quids into the cheek pouches of hamsters proved quite ineffective.",
            "3: 4 Benzo- pyrene used as a control carcinogen produced cancers on the skin, but the same chemical placed on the buccal mucosa had no effect, the authors suggesting, like Levy, Gorlin, and Gottsegen (1951) that the absence of sebaceous glands to act as a portal of entry, and the protective action of mucin were responsible.",
            "Ad- vanced hyperplastic changes were seen within two months of the application of alkaloid containing extracts to the skin, when simultaneously painted with croton oil, but a poor survival time did not permit further study.",
            "The effect of a single subcutaneous injection of extracts was also followed.",
            "One mouse, injected with a total extract, developed a transplantable palpable fibrosarcoma in the subcutis not far from the site of administration.",
            "Large numbers of apparently spontaneous tumours were seen in the animals used in these experiments, but they occurred with equal frequency in the control stock.",
            "Johnstone and Plimmer (1959) in their exhaustive review of the chemical constituents of tobacco remark, \"a large amount of research has been concentrated on the aromatic hydrocarbon content of tobacco smoke, whilst fresh and processed tobaccos have attracted specifically less attention \".",
            "Nevertheless 3: 4 benzo- pyrene has been identified in extracts of fresh and processed leaves (Bentley and  Burgan, 1958).",
            "There is some evidence to suggest that this may be derived from the atmosphere (Campbell and Lindsey, 1956).",
            "There is of course ample evidence to show that the tars produced by pyrolysis of tobacco contain carcinogens (Wynder, Graham, and Croninger, 1953).",
            "Reddy  et al. (1960) describe experiments in which the effect of tobacco tar, produced by burning \"chuttas \" and drawing the smoke through acetone, was determined on mice.",
            "Painting of the backs of the mice with the tar alone, basal cell proliferation and hyperplasia of the sweat and sebaceous glands were seen.",
            "There was no evidence of any neoplastic change at the end of four months.",
            "When heat was applied to the skin of the mouse after painting with tar, early malignancy was seen by the third month, and invasion of the dermis by the fourth.",
            "A temperature of 58\u00b0C. was chosen as it had been shown, by thermocouple, that this was the palate temperature of the \"chutta \" smoker.",
            "Khanolkar and Suryabai (1945) using a long stem thermometer recorded a somewhat higher mean tem- perature of 65\u00b0C.",
            "Reddy et at. (1960) concluded that there was not only a shorten- ing of the latent period when heat was used, but there was an increased tumour yield, and felt that these observations explained the higher incidence of cancer of the hard palate among \"chutta \" smoking women.",
            "In view of the comparative paucity of published work, and that conflicting, it was decided to paint the ears of Swiss white mice with an extract as near to that present in the mouth of the betel/tobacco chewer as could be devised.",
            "The paint was prepared daily just before use.",
            "Three betel vine leaves were placed on a bench, and the inner smeared with moist stone lime.",
            "The equivalent weight of dried lime was about 0.2 g.",
            "On this were placed shavings of betel nut, approximately 4.0 g., and about 0.5 g. of \"gambir \" together with about 1.0 g. of sun-dried tobacco imported from South India.",
            "(Indonesian tobaccos are sometimes used in Singapore.)",
            "The leaves were then wrapped round these ingredients and the whole trans- ferred to a brass mortar and pestle to be ground for 5 minutes.",
            "2 ml. of water were added, mixed throughly with the ground material, and the resultant dark red mass squeezed by the fingers.",
            "The fluid so obtained, temperature 28\u00b0C., also dark red in colour, was then painted on the ears of the mice by a number 5 camel hair brush and allowed to dry.",
            "Drying took about 10 minutes.",
            "For the first few days the mice seemed rather irritated, but thereafter the act of painting did not seem to worry them, nor did they make attempts to clean the betel juice off.",
            "Initially a pilot trial using 12 numbered Swiss white, brother-sister mated, mice was instituted.",
            "They were painted daily for two years.",
            "Special care was taken to ensure that the mice had an adequate amount of Vitamin A in the diet, as it has been shown that, in the rat, lack of this substance may cause keratinisationi of epithelial tissues, round cell infiltration and secondary inflam- matory change (McCarrison, 1931).",
            "The mice were kept in a non-airconditioned room (average temperature 28\u00b0C.: average relative humidity 84 per cent).",
            "No macroscopic lesions were seen until 22 months had elapsed.",
            "A left ear was noted to be thickened, hardened and partially ulcerated.",

            "Ulceration of the right ear occurred one month after the left.",
            "Sections revealed loss of a large part of the ear, the bare area being covered by a fibrin cap which contained moderate numbers of polymorphs.",
            "The remaining skinii towards the base of the ear, on both inner and outer aspects, showed marked thickening, often focal in nature and numerous intra-epidermal keratin filled cysts.",
            "There was no evidence of malignancy and inflammatory changes were not prominent.",
            "Similar changes were seen in a second mouse at much the same time, and in a third, one month after painting had ceased.",
            "Ulceration of the left ear continued slowly over three months, when the right ear showed similar changes.",
            "A fourth mouse showed ulceration of the base of the right ear laterally 32 months after the trial started, i.e., 8 months after painting had stopped (Fig. 1).",
            "A regional lymph node was markedly enlarged on palpation.",
            "Sections showed an invasive squamous carcinoma (Fig. 2) arising in a polypoid excrescence containing numerous keratin filled cysts, some of which communicated with the surface.",
            "Cell nests were prominent.",
            "Parts of the invading tumour had reached the perichondrium.",
            "The skin on either side of the tumour was thickened and showed marked appendage change.",
            "The lymph node was invaded by a well differentiated squamous carcinoma of the same general structure as the primary tumour (Fig. 3).",
            "There was some doubt as to whether this was a direct extension or a metastatic phenomenon as the lymph node was somewhat torn.",
            "The sub- capsular sinus showed marked catarrh.",
            "The other ear showed thickening of the epidermis and ulceration of the tip.",
            "In a fifth mouse, six months after painting ceased, a large subcutaneous nodule was seen to grow rapidly, just to the right of the midline, some 1.5 cm. behind the ears, reaching in five weeks a diameter of 1.5 cm.",
            "The swelling became ulcerated and the mouse was killed.",
            "The tumour was almost globular in shape and had a well marked pseudo-capsule, which was significantly infiltrated with round cells.",
            "Histologically a basi-squamous carcinoma, there were, principally at the growing margin, numerous islets of dark staining basal cells intermingled with very small differentiated cell nests (Fig. 4).",
            "Large areas at the centre were mummified, infected and necrotic.",
            "Calcification was seen in several places.",
            "The ulcerated portion of the tumour was grossly infected and covered by a dense fibrin cap.",
            "At the margins the epidermis was thickened with numerous mitotic figures in the basal layer.",
            "Appendages were replaced by epithelial plugs, several of which showed signal nuclear atypia.",
            "Similar, but lesser, departures from normal were present in most of the contiguous epidermis, as well as in both ears.",
            "In a sixth mouse a benign squamous papilloma was found between the right ear and the rear fold of the fore-limb.",
            "This was well differentiated.",
            "The skin onI either side showed moderate thickening and some appendage change.",
            "At death, of the remaining six mice, two showed relatively minor subcutaneous sepsis at the root of the ears, in two there was no demonstrable lesion, in the fifth there was a reticulum type sarcoma.",

            "Painting of a second batch of 41 mice was begun in April, 1958, and is still in progress.",
            "The first lesion, noted six months later, was a papilloma situated at the base of the left ear.",
            "It was removed surgically.",
            "The epithelial covering was thick, differentiated and hyperkeratotic, being considerably infolded to form large keratin filled cysts (Fig. 5).",
            "There was one small area of questionable break-through.",
            "The subjacent dermis was rather oedematous and was conspicuously infiltrated by acute and chronic inflammatory cells.",
            "Numerous small blood vessels were noted.",
            "The second lesion appeared in another mouse 7 months later.",
            "The left ear began to ulcerate, and within 15 days the entire ear had vanished.",
            "Painting was stopped as soon as ulceration was noted and eventually the ear site healed, to break down again six months later when it rapidly extended on to the neck tissues.",

            "Although we have, for financial reasons, been unable to start with a large number of animals and examine individuals at fixed intervals, nevertheless by study of the available sections a fairly compre- hensive picture of the possible sequence of events can be arrived at.",
            "Normal mouse skin is very simple (Glicksmann, 1945).",
            "Spinous and basal cells are contained in a single layer, which is covered by a thin keratin coat.",
            "In regions with a reduced number of hairs such as the ears, the epidermis is thicker and layering more obvious (Fig. 6) but nowhere does it approach the human type of epidermal covering.",
            "The earliest change occurred in broad foci.",
            "The basal cells came to occupy the entire basement membrane; a concomitant increase in the number of spinous cells gave rise to a definite prickle cell layer which differentiated into sizeable granular and keratin strata (Fig. 7).",
            "Irregular maturation of the keratin layer was seen, characterised by the presence of large cuboidal nucleated cells with an intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm.",
            "Elsewhere keratin was present to excess, often coated with particles of paint.",
            "Small intra-epidermal keratin-filled cysts were not uncommon (Fig. 8).",
            "As well as this change into the human type of epidermis, there were focal areas of yet further hyperplasia.",
            "Here the prickle cell layer was much thicker, the spinous cells larger, the basal cells stained more deeply, and mitoses were present in increased numbers (Fig. 9).",
            "From such areas, epidermal downgrowths, often apparently without basement membrane, penetrated for varying distances into the dermis.",
            "These downgrowths remained very well differentiated, and were considered benign, although one such was seen to be in close contact with, if not actually invading the aural cartilage (Fig. 10).",
            "Conspicuous epidermal appendage change was seen in about 65 per cent of the mice.",
            "Hair follicles seemed shortened, their mouths filled by keratin plugs (Fig. 11).",
            "Sebaceous glands showed squamous metaplasia, many retaining a thin basal cell layer on the outside (Fig. 12), while in a few this seemed to be absent (Fig. 13).",
            "Many of the appendages were scarcely recognisable as such, and were it not for the persistence of a central structure derived from the lumen of the original hair follicle, containing a small piece of keratin (Fig. 12), or the presence of clumps of large granular sebaceous cells (Fig. 12), would have been indistinguishable from enlarged epidermal downgrowths (Fig. 13).",
            "Ulceration was common, invariably beginning in areas of hyperplastic epi- thelium.",
            "Many of these ulcers seemed to heal rapidly, dense collagen formation with parallel rows of fibrocytes beneath an intact epithelium being a fre- quent finding.",
            "In one mouse cartilaginous metaphasia was induced in new connective tissue laid down close to ear cartilage, this new cartilage being of a human rather than murine type (Fig. 14).",
            "Pre-existing collagen appeared normal.",
            "Mast cells were present in increased numbers beneath many, but not all, of the areas of epidermal thickening, and were seen in very large numbers beneath the epidermis bordering on the malignant tumours.",
            "Infection was very common, varying considerably in degree.",
            "Such areas were often covered by a thick infected crust, and the dermis seemed to contain large numbers of pigment-containing macrophages, the origin of the pigment being obscure.",

            "In the control mice there were two spontaneous malignancies, one hepatic, the other probably uterine or ovarian, this latter ulcerating through the hind quarters.",
            "DISCULTSSION",
            "It is difficult to evaluate how much of the change in the ears and surrounding skiil was due to irritation by non-carcinogens, and how much to the carcinogen itself.",
            "Orr (1938) painted mice with benzene, a moderately powerful irritant, and observed, within 6 weeks, epithelial hyperplasia and some depilation.",
            "The hyperplasia was of the same nature as that seen with known carcinogens, but the number of cell layers was not so great.",
            "Many of the hair follicles were enlarged and hyperplastic with swollen internal root sheaths and enlarged hyperchromatic bulbs.",
            "There was never the appearance, such as is seen after one week of methyl- cholanthrene painting, where almost every hair follicle is shrunken into a small sub-epithelial solid wedge.",
            "This latter picture was not infrequently seen in our mice (Fig. 15), and indeed, most of the changes in our animals, if observed in a mouse painted with a known carcinogen, would be labelled as premalignant.",
            "Dermal changes are equally difficult to assess.",
            "Gross infection was commnon.",
            "In mice with early epidermal changes, Ino alteration was seen in the collageni comparable to that described by Orr (1938) and others.",
            "Perhaps this may be ascribed to the relative weakness of the carcinogen.",
            "The available clinical and statistical evidence all points to tobacco as the carcinogen in the betel/tobacco quid.",
            "Why our relatively crude experiments should have apparently succeeded in producing malignancies when the more sophisticated techniques of Mody and Ranadive (1959), using purer and stronger tobacco extracts, have failed, points, we feel, to the importance of co-carcinogenic factors.",
            "Which of the many components of the quid is of the greatest importance remains to be discovered, or, indeed, it may be that tobacco is the co-carcinogen for some other substance.",
            "The arbitrary choice of the ear for painting may have been responsible in some measure for our success.",
            "Here the amount of underlying dermis is small, and is backed by a plate of relatively avascular cartilage.",
            "Any carcinogenl passinig through the epidermis was likely to remain there for some time before absorption, and not diffuse through to deeper tissues.",
            "The products of dermal degeneration, whether caused by irritation, or by the carcinogen, are also more likely to promote a newgrowth in the overlying dermis, as has been suggested by Orr (1938) and Marchant and Orr (1953).",
            "In this connection, it is noteworthy that although the tongue is as near the heat and smoke from a \" chutta \" smoked with the burninig end in the mouth, as is the hard palate, Reddy and Rao (1957)  in a series of 107 oral cancers in female smokers, found 68 palatal cancers for 14 lingual, i.e., 5 to 1.",
            "The dermis of the tongue has easy access to the underlying tissues; that of the palate is backed by bone.",
            "Similar conditions obtain in the inner aspect of the labio-gingival fold (\" khaini\" cancers) and in the inner aspect of the buccal sulcus, but not, of course, on the cheek itself.",
            "Although at present, as will be evident from the papers quoted, a problem of magnitude, it is our belief that the incidence of betel chewers cancer will fall, particularly in multiracial Singapore, as living and, probably more importalnt, educational standards improve.",
            "In Malaya this decrease will be much slower as the isolation of South Indian labour on rubber estates and on Public Works",

            "Background",
            "The potential exists for laboratory personnel to be exposed to engineered carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) in studies aimed at producing conditions similar to those found in natural surface waters [e.g., presence of natural organic matter (NOM)].",
            "Objective",
            "The goal of this preliminary investigation was to assess the release of CNMs into the laboratory atmosphere during handling and sonication into environmentally relevant matrices.",
            "Methods",
            "We measured fullerenes (C60), underivatized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (raw MWCNT), hydroxylated MWCNT (MWCNT-OH), and carbon black (CB) in air as the nanomaterials were weighed, transferred to beakers filled with reconstituted freshwater, and sonicated in deionized water and reconstituted freshwater with and without NOM.",
            "Airborne nanomaterials emitted during processing were quantified using two hand-held particle counters that measure total particle number concentration per volume of air within the nanometer range (10\u20131,000 nm) and six specific size ranges (300\u201310,000 nm).",
            "Particle size and morphology were determined by transmission electron microscopy of air sample filters.",
            "Discussion",
            "After correcting for background particle number concentrations, it was evident that increases in airborne particle number concentrations occurred for each nanomaterial except CB during weighing, with airborne particle number concentrations inversely related to particle size.",
            "Sonicating nanomaterial-spiked water resulted in increased airborne nanomaterials, most notably for MWCNT-OH in water with NOM and for CB.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Engineered nanomaterials can become airborne when mixed in solution by sonication, especially when nanomaterials are functionalized or in water containing NOM.",
            "This finding indicates that laboratory workers may be at increased risk of exposure to engineered nanomaterials.",
            "Large amounts of engineered nanomaterials are generated annually, and each possesses its own unique characteristics.",
            "Much work has focused on carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs), such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, because of their strength, conductivity, and applicability for biomedical applications.",
            "Consequently, considerable effort has been dedicated to understanding the health effects of these nanomaterials before they are widely used in consumer products where the potential for exposure to the general public would be increased.",
            "This is a proactive approach that has not been applied to some other classes of chemicals in the past, such as asbestos.",
            "Environmental researchers are actively examining the fate and effects on CNMs in environmentally relevant systems.",
            "Furthermore, researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and other agencies are examining the potential occupational exposures to, and respiratory effects of, CNMs.",
            "Currently, no occupational exposure limits govern workplace exposure to engineered nanomaterials.",

            "CNMs and other nanomaterials are usually placed into liquid suspension for easier delivery to experimental models.",
            "Conventional wisdom suggests that nanomaterials in liquid suspension generally pose lower inhalation risk to workers.",
            "However, CNMs and other nanomaterials often agglomerate in aqueous suspension, requiring continuous mixing or sonication to deagglomerate nanomaterials.",
            "It is possible that this common laboratory process results in the release and dispersion of nanomaterials into the air via small water droplets.",
            "This may concern scientists in general, but especially ecotoxicologists, environmental scientists, and environmental engineers working with nanomaterials in simulated natural waters.",
            "These researchers routinely generate environmentally relevant matrices in the laboratory, including waters with natural organic matter (NOM), which acts as a surfactant that enhances the stability of nanoparticle dispersions.",
            "Thus, sonication of NOM-containing water can, in theory, result in increased aerosolization of the engineered nanomaterials when compared with the same material sonicated in deionized (DI) water.",
            "It was with this premise that researchers at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center\u2019s Environmental Laboratory (ERDC-EL) volunteered to be part of a nationwide field study of potential occupational exposure to nanomaterials, currently being conducted by the NIOSH Nanotechnology Research Center (NTRC).",
            "The specific research objective of the present study was to investigate the potential for the release of airborne CNMs due to research involving the handling and mixing of CNMs with environmentally relevant matrices.",
            "The NIOSH NTRC field research team evaluated two laboratory processes: a) transfer of CNMs from storage containers to a weighing balance, and b) sonication.",

(Brattleboro, VT).",

            "Laboratory processes evaluated",
            "The first laboratory process (Figure 1A) we evaluated was weighing 4\u2013200 mg of each of the different CNMs on an electronic balance and transferring the CNMs to a beaker of water stirring atop a Corning magnetic mixing plate (Cole-Palmer, Vernon Hills, IL).",
            "This procedure was performed inside a laboratory safety hood with the air flow turned off temporarily and the sash halfway open.",
            "This was done because the hood air velocity (measured at 100 ft/min at the face) was high enough to result in loss of nanomaterial from the spatula during the transfer from the material container to the analytical balance.",
            "The second laboratory process (Figure 1B) we evaluated was probe sonication (50 W; 40% duty cycle) of 100 mg/L previously mixed CNMs for 20 min inside an unventilated sonication enclosure (Branson Sonifier model 450; Branson Ultrasonic, Danbury, CT).",
            "CNMs were sonicated in DI water or hard reconstituted water with and without 100 mg/L NOM.",
            "Personal protective equipment worn by workers when performing weighing and transfer tasks and sonication processes consisted of a cotton laboratory coat, latex gloves, and an N95 filtering facepiece respirator.",
            "Airborne particle detection",
            "We used two direct-reading, real-time instruments to determine whether CNM emissions occurred during these laboratory processes.",
            "The sampling inlet of each instrument was positioned as close as possible to the suspected point of emission for a given process (indicated by arrows in Figure 1).",
            "We used an HHPC-6 hand-held particle counter (ART Instruments, Grants Pass, OR) to determine the airborne particle number concentration based on optical counting principles using laser light scattering.",
            "This instrument measured the total number of particles per liter (particles/L) of air across six specific size cut points: 300, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 5,000, and 10,000 nm.",
            "The second instrument used was a TSI model 3007 hand-held condensation particle counter (CPC; TSI, Inc., Shoreview, MN), operated as described by.",
            "The CPC unit measures particles in the size range of 10\u20131,000 nm, with data expressed as the total number of particles per cubic centimeter (particles/cc) of sampled air.",
            "The upper limit of detection for the HHPC-6 and CPC are 70,000 particles/L and 100,000 particles/cc, respectively.",
            "Because the size and degree of particle agglomeration were unknown at the time of this evaluation, we determined that using these particle-sizing instruments would provide a semiquantitative indication of the relative size range and magnitude of potential emissions for each process.",
            "Ambient/background particle number concentration measurements were collected inside each laboratory before each task/process and used to adjust the process-specific measurements via subtraction.",
            "Additionally, two general area air samples were collected before and after the laboratory processes at an area away from the processes, but in the same room, to serve as an indicator of background concentrations not related to specific processes.",
            "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)",
            "In addition to direct-reading instrumentation, filter-based air samples were collected to qualitatively determine whether engineered nanomaterials were emitted during the laboratory processes.",
            "The air sampling filters were positioned as close as possible to the suspected emission source (i.e., slightly above the analytical balance during weighing of material) (Figure 1) for the duration of the task or process to increase the probability of capturing nanomaterials and to simulate extreme case scenarios for laboratory personnel.",
            "This type of sampling strategy should not be interpreted as representative of full-shift worker exposure, yet it does provide an indication of potential worker exposure due to inadequate air sampling instrumentation that can be worn by workers to estimate CNMs in a worker\u2019s personal breathing zone.",
            "Sampling times ranged from 25 to 186 min (air volume, 175\u20131,300 L) and were dependent on the time necessary to complete the task being evaluated.",
            "The filter-based air samples were collected using Leland Legacy pumps (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA) that were operated at a sampling rate of 7.0 L/min.",
            "Pumps were calibrated before and after each day of sampling.",
            "Air samples were collected on 37-mm diameter, 0.8-\u03bcm pore size, open-face mixed cellulose ester membrane filters.",
            "Additionally, one general area air sample was collected at an area away from the process, but in the same room, to serve as an indicator of background concentrations not related to specific processes.",
            "Sample filters were then analyzed using TEM with energy dispersive spectroscopy and a digital image system for particle sizing and elemental composition.",
            "TEM allows the microscopist the ability to identify particles in the nanometer size range and the morphology of the particles (size, shape, degree of agglomeration).",
            "The sample filters were prepared by direct preparation in accordance with NIOSH Method 7402 using acetone vapor to collapse the filter media onto a copper TEM grid.",
            "A bulk sample of each material handled was deposited onto blank mixed cellulose ester filter media and prepped in a manner identical to other air samples.",
            "The bulk material was used by the microscopist to identify each nanomaterial of interest.",
            "At least 20 random grid openings per sample were examined via TEM.",
            "If the nanomaterial of interest was found, a digital image of the structure was captured.",

            "Figure 2 demonstrates that sonication of water containing 100 mg/L NOM resulted in the aerosolization of water droplets.",
            "This water droplet plume was generated during almost every sonication pulse.",

            "After adjusting for background particle number concentrations, it was evident that increases in the airborne particle number concentration occurred during each process for almost all the CNMs examined.",
            "Airborne particle number concentrations were inversely related to particle size, with the size distribution of particles skewed toward those CNMs with an aerodynamic diameter < 1 \u03bcm.",
            "During handling of hydrophobic C60 and raw MWCNT, the highest airborne particle number concentrations were seen at the 300-nm size {53,119 particles/L for C60 and 123,403 particles/L for raw MWCNT [above the upper limit of detection (70,000 particles/L) for the HHPC-6], followed by the 500-nm size (3,884 particles/L for C60 and 34,446 particles/L for raw MWCNT)}.",
            "When analyzed at the 10\u20131,000 nm scale, airborne C60 and raw MWCNT particle number concentrations were higher than background particle number concentrations and approximately the same particle number concentrations (~ 1,500 particles/cc).",
            "Similar handling effects were seen by when gentle air currents in the laboratory produced airborne single-walled carbon nanotube particles.",
            "Sonication caused aerosolization of C60 in a DI water suspension and raw MWCNT in a hard reconstituted water suspension containing 100 mg/L NOM.",
            "Sonication produced airborne C60 and MWCNT at concentrations approximately one-half and one-third, respectively, of those observed during the weighing process (23,856 particles/L for C60 and 42,796 particles/L for raw MWCNT in the 300-nm range).",
            "We observed a similar trend to the handling process during sonication, where highest particle number concentrations were in the 300- and 500-nm size ranges.",
            "However, sonication increased airborne C60 and raw MWCNT particle number concentrations in the 10\u20131,000 nm size range (2,176 and 2,776 particles/cc, respectively) compared with weighing and handling dry CNMs.",
            "We observed a slightly different trend with MWCNT-OH and CB, two functionalized, water-soluble forms of CNMs.",
            "Airborne concentrations of MWCNT-OH and CB were very low during weighing and transferring, with the highest particle number concentrations detected in the 500-nm range (3,065 particles/L for MWCNT-OH and 1,428 particles/L for CB).",
            "This was confirmed in the 10\u20131,000 nm size range as well (676 and 0 particles/cc, respectively).",
            "However, sonication of MWCNT-OH in a moderately hard reconstituted water suspension with 100 mg/L NOM and CB in DI water suspension resulted in dramatically higher airborne particle number concentrations compared with handling dry CNMs.",
            "The highest particle number concentrations were in the 300-nm size range [144,623 particles/L for MWCNT-OH and 156,336 particles/L for CB; both of these values exceeded the upper limit of quantification of the HHPC-6 (70,000 particles/L), followed by the 500-nm range (65,402 particles/L for MWCNT-OH and 54,242 particles/L for CB].",
            "In the 10\u20131,000 nm size range, there was no change in particle number concentrations between handling and sonicating MWCNT-OH, but there was an increase in particle number concentration when sonicating CB (1,057 particles/cc).",
            "TEM",
            "Filter-based air samples were collected during each of the laboratory tasks and processes.",
            "TEM images verified the morphology and relative sizes of particles captured during the laboratory processes (Figure 3).",
            "All samples were collected as short-duration, process-specific area samples and were not in the breathing zone of the workers.",
            "The background sample image shows amorphous particles that were identified as not being engineered CNMs (Figure 3A).",
            "C60 particles were agglomerated during handling but partially deagglomerated when sonicated (Figure 3B and C, respectively).",
            "Figure 3D, E, and F represent raw airborne MWCNT during weighing, sonication in DI water, and sonication in moderately hard reconstituted water containing 100 mg/L NOM, respectively.",
            "Note that typical tubular structures are missing from raw MWCNT during the handling process.",
            "However, we observed tubular structures during sonication in both types of suspension, with more tubes aerosolized and captured on the filter when in water containing NOM.",
            "The raw MWCNT agglomerates featured in the TEM images for both suspensions were approximately 500 nm in diameter.",
            "MWCNT-OH was highly agglomerated when handled, with a diameter of > 1,000 nm (Figure 3G).",
            "Airborne CB was somewhat agglomerated during handling and more highly agglomerated when sonicated in DI water (Figure 3H and I, respectively).",
            "Discussion",
            "This case study served as a range-finding survey of airborne nanomaterials emitted during common tasks performed in a laboratory that investigates environmental risks of engineered nanomaterials.",
            "In addition, this study allowed the NIOSH NTRC field team to test analytical equipment and methodologies under various laboratory conditions to evaluate potential occupational exposure to engineered nanomaterials.",
            "Specifically, this research effort combined semiquantitative airborne particle number concentrations with qualitative TEM imaging to provide a weight-of-evidence evaluation of whether engineered nanomaterials were released during laboratory tasks.",
            "To our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest that engineered nanoparticles may be released from aqueous suspensions during sonication.",
            "Results of this study imply that the commonly held belief that engineered nanomaterials in suspension during sonication pose low risk of inhalation exposure may need some reconsideration.",
            "This is especially true with regard to results from a recent international survey of nanomaterial firms and laboratories; in that study, found that many workers in the field think nanomaterials pose no risk.",
            "After accounting for background particle counts, we detected increased particle number concentrations during the handling of dry CNMs and also during the sonication of CNM suspensions (Table 1).",
            "An interesting observation during the present study was the differential behavior between hydrophobic and hydrophilic CNMs with regard to different laboratory processes.",
            "During material handling and weighing, we observed higher airborne particle number concentrations of the hydrophobic CNMs (C60 and raw MWCNT) compared with hydrophilic CNMs.",
            "Lower particle number concentrations of aerosolized CNMs at 300 and 500 nm were noted during sonication, yet cumulative particle number concentrations in the 10\u20131,000 nm size range were elevated compared with the handling process.",
            "This finding was more pronounced when raw MWCNTs were sonicated in moderately hard reconstituted water containing 100 mg/L NOM, suggesting that sonication of CNM suspensions may increase the number of smaller-sized CNM agglomerates (i.e., < 300 nm)\u2014as would be expected with sonication\u2014that were not detected by the HHPC-6 particle counter.",
            "An opposite pattern was observed when the hydrophilic CNMs (MWCNT-OH and CB) were compared.",
            "Very low particle number concentrations were detected during handling of hydrophilic CNMs, yet sonicating these hydrophilic CNMs, whether in a DI water suspension or a moderately hard reconstituted water suspension with 100 mg/L NOM, resulted in dramatically higher airborne particle number concentrations.",
            "From this finding, along with visual evidence provided by TEM examination of the air-sampling filters, we hypothesize that CNM agglomerates are being emitted to the laboratory atmosphere in water droplets.",
            "These data demonstrate that care should be exercised when handling dry hydrophobic CNMs and also when sonicating wet CNMs in suspension.",
            "A similar pattern of emissions and potential exposure was observed by during a study of nanomaterial polymer laboratory workers.",
            "In the present study, all filter-based air samples collected during weighing and transfer processes, with the exception of raw MWCNT, showed the presence of the engineered nanomaterial handled.",
            "Likewise, all samples collected during sonication, regardless of the nanomaterial in suspension, showed visual evidence of the presence of the engineered nanomaterial when analyzed by TEM.",
            "The majority of the images presented in Figure 3 indicate that single spheres or nanotubes are more the exception than the rule; most particles showed clear evidence of agglomeration.",
            "However, this may be due to the current methodology that uses 0.8-\u03bcm filter membranes, which may allow small, individual CNMs to pass through and thus be unavailable for analysis.",
            "The images shown in Figure 3 clearly provide strong visual evidence that emissions from specific tasks and processes can occur.",
            "No evidence of engineered nanomaterial was present on the background air filter sample collected.",
            "Our data indicate that although suspensions may minimize aerosolization of CNMs relative to their dry form, sonication of such suspensions outside protective enclosures can result in aerosolization and thus potential exposure to nanosized particulates (Figure 4).",
            "If sonication occurs outside an enclosure, as often occurs in laboratory settings, the proximity of the researcher\u2019s breathing zone may result in inhalation of CNM particulates in water droplets and/or mists.",
            "Similarly, airborne water droplets can be generated by standard aquaria that use air stones or other air supplies to aerate test waters during long-term aquatic toxicology studies.",
            "The airborne CNMs in water droplets have the potential to cause pulmonary effects similar to those described for particulate matter, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), and MWCNTs.",
            "The mass balance of CNMs collected during the laboratory processes were not determined, so the mass of airborne CNMs is unknown, making it difficult to compare with CNM inhalation toxicity studies or to occupational exposure limits for carbon-based materials such as respirable graphite or particulate matter.",
            "However, found that organizations that used nanomaterials in suspensions or embedded in matrices were less likely to make recommendations for respiratory protection.",
            "With sonication being a critical component of nanomaterial synthesis and deagglomeration, this survey result suggests that inhalation exposure may be an overlooked safety component during this commonly used laboratory process.",
            "Despite being housed in an enclosure during this experimental process evaluation, the sonicator has the potential to emit engineered nanomaterials when the enclosure door is opened after the sonication process is complete.",
            "If this occurs, airborne CNMs may be inhaled by laboratory workers.",
            "In addition, if the sealing gasket around the perimeter of the enclosure door is damaged or otherwise breached, release of aerosolized droplets to the laboratory atmosphere may result.",
            "Furthermore, these airborne CNM-containing water droplets have the potential to deposit on other surfaces within the sonication cabinet and in the laboratory.",
            "Once dried, CNM may become resuspended if disturbed and potentially result in exposure via inhalation.",
            "Finally, these nanomaterials may be available for dermal deposition if laboratory workers unknowingly contact contaminated surfaces with unprotected skin (e.g., hands, forearms).",
            "Currently, there are no occupational exposure limits specific to engineered nanomaterials; however, basic precautionary procedures and control equipment can dramatically reduce airborne releases of nanomaterials.",
            "Therefore, environmental scientists should implement a general or nano-specific environmental, health, and safety program at their organizations, use personal protective equipment, and develop standard operational procedures to minimize potential hazards when working with engineered nanomaterials in environmentally relevant laboratory systems.",
            "Although this preliminary research has generated some interesting and relevant findings, specific uncertainties associated with experimental design and implementation need to be addressed.",
            "First, this single-case study was designed to determine the relative magnitude of airborne nanomaterial emissions associated with tasks and materials used in environmental laboratory experiments.",
            "We used only a single data point for each of the tasks and materials during this first assessment.",
            "Thus, the data presented here are not statistically based.",
            "These data should be viewed as an indicator of the need for additional studies that focus on a robust statistically based experimental design, experimental variables, specific engineered nanomaterials, and sample collection.",
            "Second, the data interpretation can be confounding because of the two different particle counters used to measure airborne nano-sized particles.",
            "The two particle counters use different counting principles, counting efficiencies, and size ranges, so the data are not directly convertible to identical units.",
            "Our intentions were to show the size ranges and relative number concentrations on a task- specific basis.",
            "This way, a reader can examine the data separately according to task and determine which task emitted nanomaterials.",
            "Thus, these data should be interpreted as relative indicators of CNM release, especially since the data were adjusted by subtracting background particle number concentrations.",
            "Furthermore, because the direct-reading, real-time instrumentations are not material specific (e.g., MWCNTs or CB only) and cannot identify the chemical composition of the particles detected (e.g., MWCNT vs. background particulate matter or water droplets), we cannot definitively conclude that increases in particle number concentrations for a specific operation are due to a release of particulate material from that process.",
            "However, because the particle number concentrations in the lower size ranges were higher than background and the results of the TEM analyses yielded visual evidence of the engineered nanomaterials, we can conclude that a release occurred and that the potential for exposure exists.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Care must be taken when conducting laboratory studies using CNMs in environmentally relevant matrices.",
            "Sonicating hydrophobic CNMs in DI water suspensions results in airborne particle number concentrations lower than when handling dry CNMs.",
            "In contrast, sonicating hydrophilic CNMs in a moderately hard reconstituted water suspension containing natural surfactants dramatically increases airborne CNM particles compared with handling of dry CNMs.",
            "Thus, researchers using these environmentally relevant matrices should use appropriate protective equipment (respiratory and dermal protection) in addition to employing adequate engineering controls to minimize CNM aerosolization during preparation and experimental usage.",
            "Although we examined laboratory processes in an environmental research laboratory, similar results are also possible in other laboratories that use similar materials (e.g., functionalized CNMs), similar tasks (e.g., sonication), and similar dispersive agents (e.g., surfactants).",
            "Additional research is needed to better characterize CNM emissions and worker exposure during handling and sonication to corroborate the results of this case study."

            "These humanized mice when inoculated with HTLV-1 were indeed productively infected, as shown by the detection and the expression of the provirus in human cells.",
            "We observed that T-cell development in the thymus of these mice was profoundly altered, as ascertained by the increased proliferation of activated mature T lymphocytes that accumulated in the thymus as well as in the spleen.",
            "These alterations of human thymic T-cell development may be linked to the development of ATL\u2013like pathologies.",
            "These results show that this humanized mouse model provides an invaluable tool not only to study the early stages of the infection leading to the development of malignant lymphoproliferations, but also to design new therapeutic approaches.",
            "Introduction",
            "HTLV-1 (Human T cell Leukaemia Virus, type 1), the only retrovirus associated with a neoplastic disease in humans, is the etiologic agent of Adult T-cell Leukaemia (ATL), an aggressive clonal lymphoproliferative disorder of mature CD4+ CD25+ T cells.",
            "It is considered that HTLV-1 infection early in life predisposes to ATL.",
            "Indeed, epidemiological studies have stressed that ATL develops after an extremely long (several decades) latency period, often in patients who were infected as neonates through breastfeeding.",
            "T-cell leukemias such as T-ALL (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) which mainly occur in children and adolescents, are thought to result from malignant thymocytes arising at defined stages of intrathymic T-cell development.",
            "Thus, HTLV-1 infection within the thymus might be an essential event in the pathogenesis of ATL.",
            "In vitro, HTLV-1 can productively infect human hematopoietic CD34+ progenitor cells as well as human immature thymocytes.",
            "It has also been demonstrated that reconstitution of T lymphopoiesis with HTLV-1-infected CD34+ cells in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice engrafted with human thymus and liver tissues resulted in the alteration of thymopoiesis, as shown by abnormalities in the size of thymocyte subpopulations.",
            "Recently, Banerjee et al. have generated a humanized model, which partially recapitulates HTLV-1-induced T-cell leukemogenesis by inoculating immunodeficient mice with human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells infected ex vivo with HTLV-1.",
            "HTLV-1 is a complex retrovirus that relies upon multiple gene products to accomplish replication and disease.",
            "Among them, Tax and HBZ are key regulatory proteins.",
            "HBZ, encoded by the antisense strand of the HTLV-1 proviral DNA, is permanently expressed and required for efficient viral infectivity and persistence, whereas Tax has been shown to deregulate a number of cellular genes leading to cellular proliferation, to induce genetic instability, thus contributing to malignant progression.",
            "Studies on Tax-transgenic mice that express tax under the control of either the HTLV-1 LTR or alternative promoters that target Tax expression to lymphocytes have demonstrated that Tax can perturb lymphocyte functions.",
            "The development of tumors in most of these transgenic mouse models also provided evidence of the leukemogenic potential of Tax.",
            "Interestingly, when the transgene expression was placed under the control of the Lck promoter, which restricts Tax expression to developing thymocytes, an ATL-like phenotype developed in the transgenic mice.",
            "These observations suggest that the leukemogenic activity of Tax is related to T-cell development in the thymus.",
            "We have previously reported that Tax, by silencing E2A transcription factors, down-regulates the expression of the pT\u03b1 gene thus perturbing \u03b2-selection, the early and critical checkpoint of human T-cell development in the thymus.",
            "These in vivo and in vitro studies indicated that HTLV-1 infection in the thymus might be a prerequisite for the malignant lymphoproliferation associated with this retroviral infection.",
            "In the present study, we first investigated the in vivo effects of HTLV-1 infection on human T-cell development in \u201cHuman Immune System\u201d (HIS) mice by transplanting human CD34+ cord blood cells into conditioned newborn BALB/c Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- recipient mice.",
            "The resulting HIS mice were infected with HTLV-1, at a time when the successive stages of the \u03b1\u03b2T-cell development are evident in the thymus of these mice.",
            "In the HTLV-1-infected Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice, we observed efficient viral expression and profound alterations in human thymopoiesis, as shown by the accumulation of activated mature single-positive CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the thymus and in the spleen.",
            "The role of Tax in that process is indicated by an increased expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent genes such as CD25 and Bfl-1 in thymocytes of these mice.",
            "In addition, abnormalities frequently observed in ATL such as hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and lymphoma were detected in HTLV-1-infected mice, several months after HTLV-1 infection.",
            "This HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- animal model might be of great interest to decipher the initial steps of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1.",
            "Results",
            "HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice were generated by intrahepatic transplantation of human CD34+ cord blood cells into sublethally irradiated immunocompromised newborn BALB/c Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice.",
            "We first analyzed by flow cytometry the expression of CD4 and CD8 on human CD45+ (hu-CD45) cells in the thymus of HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice transplanted with CD34+ cells.",
            "Five weeks after transplantation, immature CD3- thymocytes, including the double-negative (DN) CD4-CD8- cells, the CD4+ immature single-positive (CD4ISP) cells and the double-positive (DP) CD4+CD8+cells were found to be predominant, whereas a low percentage of mature CD3+ T-cells containing DP cells and single-positive (SP) CD4+ or CD8+ cells was detected.",
            "pT\u03b1 has been shown to be highly expressed in immature thymocytes and more specially in CD4ISP cells, just before the pre-T-cell Receptor complex formation.",
            "Eight weeks after transplantation, the population of mature thymocytes predominated over that of immature thymocytes, indicating that human \u03b1\u03b2T-cell development was completed in the thymus of transplanted HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice (Figure 1A).",
            "At that time, approximately 90% of the cells present in the thymus of the HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice expressed hu-CD45+.",
            "Circulating human mature T cells were also detected in the blood and secondary lymphoid organs (Figure 1B).",
            "Thus, mature T cells represented about 17% of the hu-CD45+ cells in the spleen, 10 weeks after CD34+ transplantation (Figure 1C).",
            "These observations are in line with those previously published and confirm that the successive maturational steps of human \u03b1\u03b2T-cell development were completed in the thymus of these mice within two months following human CD34+ inoculation.",
            "Evaluation of proviral load in HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice",
            "Taking into account the chronology of the different maturational stages of human \u03b1\u03b2T-cell development in the thymus of HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice, HTLV-1 infection of these mice was carried out between 4 and 8 weeks after CD34+ transplantation.",
            "The mice were inoculated intraperitoneally either with 2\u00d7106 lethally irradiated HTLV-1-producing MT2 cells in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) or with PBS only (mock-infected) (Figure 2A).",
            "In parallel, untransplanted BALB/c Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice were inoculated with lethally irradiated MT2 cells.",
            "Autopsy examination between 10 and 35 weeks after HTLV-1 inoculation revealed a significant increase of the size of the thymus, the spleen and lymph nodes of HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice inoculated with MT2 cells, when compared to those of mock-infected animals.",
            "Furthermore tumor-like nodules were frequently observed in the spleen and the liver of MT2-inoculated mice (Figure 2B).",
            "To ascertain that the MT2-inoculated HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice were indeed infected, we used ALU-PCR to amplify gag HTLV-1 sequences from human DNA isolated from splenocytes.",
            "The results showed that all but two MT2-inoculated HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice were HTLV-1-infected (Figure 2C, lanes 3, 4 and Figure 2D, lane 3).",
            "As expected, viral sequences were not observed in mock-infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice (Figure 2C lanes 1, 2 and Figure 2D, lane 2).",
            "Likewise, they were not detected in MT2-inoculated BALB/c Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice, thus excluding the possibility that the inoculated irradiated MT2 cells were still present in these mice (Figure 2D, lane 1).",
            "The HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) in HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice was then evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR).",
            "An increase in the PVL was observed, which correlated with the length of the infection period (Figure 3A).",
            "Indeed, a PVL value in the range of 10 to 103 copies per 105 human cells was found in 20 mice that were sacrificed between 5 and 20 weeks after inoculation of MT2 cells.",
            "These mice were subsequently referred to as low-PVL mice.",
            "Fifteen mice that were sacrificed between 16 and 35 weeks had a PVL between 103 to 106 copies per 105 cells; these were referred to as high-PVL mice.",
            "The low PVL values (median 8.9\u00d7102 copies/105 cells) were similar to those in healthy human HTLV-1 carriers, whereas the high PVL values (median 1.1\u00d7105 copies/105 cells) were similar to those in ATL cells.",
            "These results show that HTLV-1 infection of human immune cells was established in the HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice and that the PVL correlated with the length of the infection period (r2\u200a=\u200a0.9704).",
            "We then quantified cellular clonality in the spleen of five representative HTLV-1 infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice, by measuring the frequency of the different HTLV-1 infected clones present in that organ.",
            "The calculation of the oligoclonality index is shown in Figure 3B.",
            "Each slice in the pie chart represents a single Unique Insertion Site (UIS) and the size of the slice is proportional to the relative abundance of that UIS.",
            "In the mouse with the lowest oligoclonality index (0.45), the slices of the pie chart are of similar size.",
            "In contrast, in the two mice with the highest clonality index (0.71 and 0.79), two clones were found to predominate.",
            "Although there was no significant correlation between the oligoclonality index and the proviral load, these data indicate that oligoclonal proliferation of infected cells occurred in these mice, as observed in naturally infected patients.",
            "The \u03b1\u03b2T-cell development in HTLV-1 infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice is altered in a PVL-dependent manner",
            "To investigate the effect of HTLV-1 infection on \u03b1\u03b2T cell development in HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice, we proceeded to a comparative FACS analysis of thymopoiesis in infected or in mock-infected mice.",
            "In the latter, at either 8 to 20 weeks (early) or 18 to 35 weeks (late) after PBS injection, the relative frequency of the three main human subpopulations (immature, DP and SP) remained mostly unchanged (Figure 4A).",
            "In the low-PVL HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice, the respective percentages of these subpopulations were slightly different with a higher frequency of DP cells and a lower frequency of SP cells (Figure 4B).",
            "In contrast, in the high-PVL mice, a significant depletion of the immature DN subpopulation was observed together with a strong decrease of DP thymocytes and with a large increase of the mature SP cells.",
            "Such alterations were evident in mice as young as 18 weeks, i.e. 13 weeks after inoculation with MT2 cells.",
            "These data show that the main impact of HTLV-1 infection was on the population of the most immature T cells, as indicated by their significant decrease in mice with the highest PVL.",
            "In the spleen of infected mice, the population of mature T cells increased with the PVL level to the point where mature T cells were the only human population observed in that organ (Figure 4C).",
            "These observations suggested a positive correlation between the PVL and the alterations of human T cell development observed in HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/-mice.",
            "To verify this suggestion, we analysed CD4 and CD8 expression on thymocytes of either the less mature CD3- or the more mature CD3+ subpopulations of four age-matched mice including one mock-infected mouse and three HTLV-1-infected mice, one with a low PVL and two with high PVL (Figure 4D).",
            "We observed a significant decrease in the CD3- subset, which correlated with the increase in PVL.",
            "In fact, the immature DN, CD4ISP and DP subpopulations were severely depleted in the mouse with the highest PVL (left panel), whereas the CD3+ SP cells increased to 78.3% in the same mouse (right panel).",
            "The thymocyte subpopulations in three mice with a comparable high PVL, but killed at different times after infection (20, 23 and 35 weeks) displayed a similar profile, i.e. depletion of CD3- immature and DP cells and increase of CD3+ mature SP cells (Figure 4E).",
            "These results show that HTLV-1 infection led to an increased number of mature T cells in the thymus and in the periphery.",
            "We conclude that HTLV-1 infection perturbed the development of \u03b1\u03b2T lymphocytes in the thymus of HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice, mainly by propelling immature thymocytes towards the late stages of maturation.",
            "We now propose to investigate whether such an effect is induced by the viral regulatory Tax.",
            "Activation of survival and proliferating pathways in HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice",
            "Of the 35 HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice that were inoculated with HTLV-1-producing MT2 cells, 13 mice displayed pathological features, the severity of which appeared to correlate with proviral load and with the number of activated CD25+ T-cells in the thymus (Table 1).",
            "These pathological features were observed only in high-PVL mice that were killed between 16 and 35 weeks (Figure 5A).",
            "While most of these mice only displayed enlarged lymph nodes, some of them also developed hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and thymoma (compare panel 2 to panel 1) in which the cells were found to express the Tax protein detected by immunohistochemical analysis (panels 5,6,8,9).",
            "Based on our previous experiments on human immature thymocytes, these in vivo observations therefore suggested that Tax induced the alterations in thymopoiesis observed in HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice.",
            "tax transcription was readily detected in the thymus of high-PVL mice, whereas in the low-PVL mice, it was very low or undetectable (Figure 5B).",
            "hbz transcription displayed the same pattern (Figure 5C).",
            "Finally, the observed increase in Tax transcription correlated with proviral load, unlike HBZ transcripts (Figure 5D).",
            "We previously reported that Tax protein interferes with assembly of the pre-TCR when expressed in vitro in human immature thymocytes, such as the CD4ISP thymocytes.",
            "During normal \u03b1\u03b2T-cell development, signals from the pre-TCR activate the NF-\u03baB pathways that control the expression of target genes implicated in cell proliferation and survival.",
            "We hypothesized that Tax might compensate for the absence of a functional pre-TCR by inducing NF-\u03baB activation in immature thymocytes.",
            "We therefore investigated the impact of Tax overexpression on the transcription of NF-\u03baB-related genes (RelA/p65, p105/p50, c-Rel) in immature thymocytes.",
            "We observed that the amount of the respective transcripts was much greater in TaxGFP-expressing immature thymocytes than in GFP+ control cells (Figure 6A).",
            "We also analysed isolated mRNAs to detect transcripts of the anti-apoptotic genes Bfl-1 and Bcl-2, because Bfl-1 is a target of NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity whereas Bcl-2 is independent of NF-\u03baB.",
            "Only the expression of Bfl-1 was significantly increased in Tax-expressing thymocytes (Figure 6B).",
            "These results show that Tax expressed in human immature thymocytes activates the transcription of NF-\u03baB factors and that of the Bfl-1 anti-apoptotic gene.",
            "We therefore investigated whether the NF-\u03baB dependent expression of these two genes, bcl2 and bfl1, was increased in HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice.",
            "RT-qPCR analysis showed a clear increase in the transcription of Bfl-1 in these mice, when compared to control animals (Figure 6C); this increase was comparable to that found in Tax-expressing thymocytes (Figure 6B).",
            "The increase in Bfl-1 mRNA correlated with that of tax mRNA, as did CD25 mRNA, which is also dependent on NF-\u03baB factors.",
            "Indeed, a comparative FACS analysis of mock-infected and HTLV-1 infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice indicated that the number of hu-CD45+ CD25+ cells in the thymus and in the spleen cells was significantly higher in high PVL mice than in low PVL or in control mice (Figure 7A, B, C).",
            "Lastly, activated T lymphocytes, which were mainly CD4+, were also found in the peripheral blood of an HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mouse (Figure 7D).",
            "This finding demonstrates that HTLV-1 infection induced expansion of mature T-cells in the periphery.",
            "We conclude that Tax activates the transcription of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation in the thymus of HTLV-1\u2013infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice and favours the expansion of mature activated T cells.",
            "Thus, the presence of T-cell proliferation in HTLV-1 infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice indicates that HTLV-1 infection of the thymus might be a critical pre-leukemogenic event.",
            "Discussion",
            "During the last decade, humanized mouse technology has made remarkably rapid progress, allowing the establishment of high levels of human chimerism in various host organ/tissues, particularly the immune system, liver and muscle.",
            "These humanized mice appear ideally suited for direct investigation of human infectious agents.",
            "In the present study, we have used Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice, which recapitulate the main events in the development of the human lymphoid compartment.",
            "These mice have already displayed interesting potential for studying infection with lymphotropic viruses, such as HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and EBV (Epstein-Barr Virus).",
            "In the present study, we used HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice inoculated with irradiated HTLV-1-producing cells, at a time when the human lymphoid compartment has been established, i.e. within a period of 1 to 2 months after transplanting BALB/c Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- immunodeficient animals with human CD34+ cord blood cells.",
            "This infection protocol was found to be very efficient, as in most of the inoculated HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice the provirus was found integrated in the genome of human cells.",
            "These mice were analyzed at regular intervals within a 7-month period after inoculation.",
            "We observe a sequential increase of the proviral load, which correlated with the appearance of critical alterations in the distribution of T-cell subsets in the chimeric thymus.",
            "Specifically, we observed slight differences in the respective percentages of the three main thymocyte subsets (immature, DP and SP) between HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice with a low proviral load and mock-infected animals.",
            "Conversely, in mice with a high proviral load, the SP cells predominated at the expense of the immature and DP populations.",
            "These data provide strong evidence that in vivo HTLV-1 infection of HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice perturbs human T-cell development in the thymus at the level of immature cells, by propelling development towards the mature stages.",
            "In addition, the infected mice had a high proviral load in the same range as that found in ATL patients.",
            "These findings demonstrate that HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice infected with HTLV-1 provide a suitable model for viral-induced malignancy.",
            "They further suggest that the combination of immature target cells in the thymus and the immunodeficient environment of HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice favours the rapid development of a T-cell malignancy.",
            "This model will also be helpful for studying the involvement of other HTLV-1 genes like hbz in viral pathogenesis as well as the role of the proviral integration sites.",
            "Thus, an oligoclonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells was observed in the periphery of five infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice.",
            "In contrast, preliminary results obtained from one HTLV-1 infected mouse displaying a thymoma indicate an extraordinary degree of polyclonality of integration sites in the thymus (Figure S1A).",
            "Interestingly, the three clones that dominated the population in both spleen and lymph nodes were not dominant in the thymus, and the three most abundant clones observed in the thymus were not detected in the periphery (Figure S1A, B, C).",
            "Our observations are consistent with those reported by Banerjee et al. who used a different infection strategy as well as different immunodeficient mice.",
            "Indeed, these authors generated HTLV-1-infected humanized nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (HU-NOD/SCID) mice by inoculating 4- to- 6-week NOD/SCID mice with human fetal liver-derived CD34+ cells infected ex vivo with HTLV-1.",
            "Less than half of these infected mice developed T-cell lymphomas with a CD4+CD25low or CD4+CD25low phenotype.",
            "These mice also showed greater proliferation of infected human CD34+ cells in the bone marrow, leading the authors to propose that HTLV-1 can transform CD34+ cells.",
            "However, HTLV-1 proviral sequences were not detected in CD34+ bone marrow cells from ATL patients.",
            "Banerjee et al. also reported that HTLV-1 infection skewed T-cell development in the thymus of these HTLV-1-infected HU-NOD/SCID mice, as well as in the thymus of HTLV-1-infected HU-NSG (NOD/SCID IL-2\u03b3 chainnull) mice.",
            "These data support our present observations which suggest that alterations of T-cell development play a prominent role in the initiation of HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis.",
            "In a previous study, we demonstrated that the viral Tax regulatory protein can inactivate the activity of bHLH E2A transcription factors.",
            "This inhibitory effect leads to a decrease of the transcription of the pT\u03b1 gene in immature thymocytes, thus precluding the assembly of the pre-TCR and interfering with the \u03b2-selection checkpoint.",
            "The pre-TCR plays a crucial role in T-cell development, by allowing the maturation of thymocytes with a functional \u03b2 chain.",
            "Signalling from the pre-TCR in the \u03b2-selected cells leads to the activation of NF-\u03baB, which provides survival and proliferative advantages.",
            "We hypothesize that Tax, which is able to activate the NF-\u03baB pathways, compensates for the absence of the pre-TCR in HTLV-1-infected immature thymocytes.",
            "Thus, Tax-activated NF-\u03baB would prevent apoptosis and drive proliferation.",
            "We indeed observed that activated transcription of the NF-\u03baB pathways in ex vivo Tax-expressing immature thymocytes correlated with increased transcription of Bfl1, an anti-apoptotic NF-\u03baB-responsive gene.",
            "Likewise, we found increased transcription of Bfl-1 in thymocytes of infected mice.",
            "We also observed an expansion of mature SP cells in the thymus and in the spleen of HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/-, and an increase in the percentage of CD25+ CD4+ T-cells.",
            "Finally, pathological features observed in some of these mice might be related to the disturbances of the \u03b1\u03b2T-cell development induced by HTLV-1 infection.",
            "We conclude that HTLV-1 infection can override the pre-TCR checkpoint by forcing immature thymocytes to progress towards a more differentiated phenotype (acquisition of CD4 and CD8) in the absence of the pre-TCR.",
            "The Tax protein may play a key part in this process.",
            "The observed disturbances of thymopoiesis caused by HTLV-1 infection may represent critical events in the initiation of the leukemogenic process associated with this retroviral infection.",
            "More specifically, they underline the relationships between dysregulated T-cell development and neoplastic transformation and provide another contribution to the identification of molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in leukaemogenesis.",
            "Indeed, the constitutive expression of Tax in immature thymocytes at the level of the \u03b2-selection checkpoint alters the developmentally regulated interplay between pre-TCR signalling and E2A activities, resulting in leukemia/lymphoma promotion.",
            "HTLV-1-associated T-cell leukaemia strongly resembles the Notch3-induced T-cell malignancies in several respects.",
            "Notch3, a member of the Notch family, is known to play a critical role in T-cell development and its constitutive activation has been related to T-cell leukaemia in both animal models and human diseases.",
            "The development of the T-cell leukaemogenic process requires the combined expression of Notch3 and the pre-TCR linked to a sustained down-regulation of E2A activity.",
            "It is noteworthy that in the absence of the pre-TCR, Notch3, like Tax, can force immature T-cells through otherwise pre-TCR-dependent developmental stages and favour the progression toward a more differentiated phenotype by acquisition of CD4 and CD8.",
            "In contrast with Notch3, Tax is able to activate both the alternative and canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, implying that the appearance of lymphoid tumors in HTLV-1 infected is linked to the exclusive activity of Tax.",
            "However, even if Tax down-modulates the transcription of pT\u03b1, leukemogenesis may also require continued weak expression of the pre-TCR, which cooperates with pTa to reach a critical level of NF-\u03baB activation.",
            "Future experiments should be performed to verify that hypothesis.",
            "In conclusion, our study demonstrates that BALB/c Rag2-/-\u03b3c -/- mice transplanted with human CD34+ cord blood cells provides an in vivo model to define the early steps of HTLV-1 infection that might lead to a better understanding of the initiation of the HTLV-1 associated leukemia.",
            "Our observations provide evidence that HTLV-1 infection in the thymus propels infected thymocytes toward the mature stages of T-cell development and favours the activation and the proliferation of these cells, thus providing a substrate population for further altered gene expression that would allow the emergence of a malignant clone.",

            "38 A significant increase in SOD activity and GSH levels (for G formulation but not for acid glyphosate) was observed.",
            "No differences between control and treatment groups were observed for CAT and GST activities in HepG2 cells.",
            "Our results agree with previous findings [39][40][41][42] that observed a decrease or no alteration in CAT activity when cells were treated with G formulation.",
            "These results could be explained at least in 2 ways, first, inactivation of CAT activity resulting in accumulation of intracellular ROS or second, CAT is a less sensitive biomarker for oxidative stress than SOD when HepG2 cells were exposed to G formulation.",
            "In the present work, cells exposed to the G formulation showed no variation in GST activity, which might indicate that the metabolism of the compounds present in G formulation occurs by other biotransformation pathways.",
            "Thus, although CAT and GST activities showed no alteration, the hypothesis that exposure to G formulation generates ROS cannot be discarded, since other parameters of the antioxidant response have been affected in this work.",
            "It was demonstrated that increases in SOD activity and GSH levels induced by oxidative stress may be linked to adaptive responses. [43][44][45]",
            "These adaptive responses could depend on the studied system, the glyphosate concentrations, and formulations.",
            "Glutathione increase found in the cell line could be related to an induction of g-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the enzyme that controls the biosynthesis of GSH, or to an increase in the levels of reduced GSH as a result of an increase in activity of GSH reductase.",
            "We evaluated for the first time whether exposure to G formulation increases ROS formation.",
            "We found an important increase in ROS production (140% of control) in cells treated with G formulation.",
            "Neither acid glyphosate nor AMPA treatment caused differences in ROS formation.",
            "There is a single recent work in the literature, which measures ROS formation as a result of pure glyphosate exposure using the H2DCFDA dye method. 46",
            "These authors observed that glyphosate provokes ROS production in a dose dependent manner.",
            "It should be taken into account that the concentrations of glyphosate used in this study were at least 2 times higher than those used in that study.",
            "In addition to the increase in ROS, it was observed high levels of nitrotyrosine when cells were treated with G formulation as measured by immunofluorescence.",
            "The formation of 3-nitrotyrosine represents a specific peroxynitrite-mediated protein modification.",
            "Peroxynitrite is a strong oxidant formed by reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide.",

            "Increases in GSH levels in AMPA treatment could be an adaptive single response since no other parameter was affected.",
            "In this work, the increase in GSH, induced by G formulation, triggers caspase 3/7 activation and hence induced apoptosis pathway.",
            "However other works showed that this activation was switched on by depletion of GSH. 45,49",
            "In this report, we demonstrate that cell death induced by G formulation is predominantly apoptotic, as determined by DAPI staining and caspase-3/7 activation.",
            "We found a 23.5% increase in morphological changes (condensed and fragmented nuclei) consistent with apoptotic cell death using G formulation at LC 20 .",
            "These results agree to those found by Gui et al 50 who demonstrated that glyphosate induced both apoptotic and autophagic cell death in PC12 cells as a neuronal model.",

            "However, Benachour and S\u00e9ralini 13 found that AMPA is more toxic than glyphosate in human umbilical, embryonic, and placental cells, targeting their cell membranes.",
            "Furthermore, it was demonstrated that AMPA has a potential genotoxicity. 51",
            "The comparative study of the breakdown products and their parent compounds is important because some metabolites present higher toxic effects than their parent compounds, and these are often detected in the environment.",
            "3 Although it is known that in vtro studies do not take into consideration the toxicokinetics of chemicals (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), these studies are useful to evaluate the mechanism of action of G formulation.",
            "In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrated that G formulation induced cytotoxicity, ROS production, antioxidant defense induction, and apoptosis at subagriculture concentrations.",
            "This indicates that G formulations have adjuvants that, together with the active ingredient, cause toxic effects not observed with glyphosate itself.",
            "Considering that G formulation LC 50 , obtained in this work, was 100 times lower than the concentration used in agricultural praying, agricultural workers and rural populations are the group at greatest risk.",
            "Taking into account the great deal of controversy about the risk of glyphosate-containing herbicide exposure, 5,6,[51][52][53] more investigation on this area should be necessary to understand the effect of chronic exposure on human health.",

            "Oesophagus (150)",
            "As for the mouth and pharynx, the ranking of the countries according to their death rates is different for the sexes.",
            "For males the 4 with highest rates are France (138), Switzerland (96), U.S.A. (87), Japan (71) and for females they are Finland (45), Ireland (36), United Kingdom (25), Japan ( 22).",
            "Cigarette con- sumption was high in all these countries except France whereas in the countries with lowest mortality (Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway for males and Sweden, Norway, Austria, Italy for females) only the Netherlands had high cigarette consumption.",
            "This seems to suggest a positive association but Table II shows that for neither sex was there a significant value of P.",
            "For none ofthe other commodities is there evidence of any significant association with death rates.",
            "Stomach ( 151)",
            "The ranking of countries by their death rates is closely similar for the sexes.",
            "The 4 with highest rates are the same for each sex (Japan, Austria, Finland, Germany) and that is true also for the 4 with lowest rates (Canada, New Zealand, Australia, U.S.A.).",
            "No positive associations appear for any of the commodities but Table II shows significant negative relations with tea for each sex (P = 0001 or less), and strong negative associations with solid fuel (P _ 0 005 and 0.001), and insignificant associations with cigarettes and coffee.",
            "As will be seen below, these suggestions at first sight of some kind of protective action in the stomach against specific irritants are matched for fuel and tea by strong positive relations with intestinal cancer and may have another explanation.",
            "Intestine except rectum (152-153)",
            "The connection between intestinal cancer rates and cigarette consumption contrasts strangely with that for stomach cancer, as seen in Table III.",
            "For each sex the average intestinal rate in the groups of countries increases pari passu with the average number of cigarettes consumed yearly per adult person in the population whereas the stomach rate tends to be less where consump- tion is greater.",
            "The combined gastro-intestinal rates from cancer of the two sites show a slight tendency to fall with rising consumption, but the ratio of stomach to intestine diminished greatly from 3-5 to 1-5 in males and from 1-97 to 0-85 in females.",
            "It is evident that where cigarette smoking is more prevalent more intestinal cancer occurs but the risk of cancer affecting the stomach is diminished, and this can only be explained by a limited proportion of persons in the population having a susceptibility to gastro-intestinal cancer with a preference for the intestine (above the rectum) in the case of certain carcinogens.",
            "Where those particular promoters of cancer are more prevalent in the environment a larger proportion of the resulting gastro-intestinal cancers will occur in the intestine, leaving a smaller fraction of the susceptibles available to develop cancer of the stomach.",
            "Emergence of a susceptibility to cancer in a particular organ could result from gradual exhaustion of the \" ergon/chronon\" system inherent in the genes responsible for maintaining a resistance to cancer (Gedda and Brenci, 1969).",
            "Such degradation with lapse of time of E/C systems in genes, as defined by those authors, could well account for the observed patterns of cancer incidence not only in the intestine/ stomach but also in the lung.",
            "A hypothesis that susceptibility to cancer of the lung appears progressively in part of the population with advancing age as a result of successive cell changes occurring at intervals of time was developed in a paper in 1966, where statistical evidence was produced to support it (Stocks, 1966).",
            "The same process could produce susceptibles to gastro-intestinal cancer, building up a population as age increases, which is then depleted by the action of cancer promoters, keeping the available susceptibles at a fairly constant level.",
            "There is no reason to suppose that the proportion of people who are susceptible to gastro-intestinal cancer at a particular age varies much from one country to another; thus in 14 European countries the combined death rate of females in 1964-65 ranged only from 213 per million in Sweden to 329 in Austria despite the large social and environmental differences.",
            "In the same countries however the female intestinal rate ranged from 56 in Finland to 137 in Denmark, and the stomach rate ranged from 106 in France to 236 in Austria.",
            "Consumption of solid fuel, consisting almost entirely of coal, shows the same kind of statistical relations with intestinal and stomach cancer as appear for cigarettes.",
            "In Table IV the countries are grouped according to annual consump- tion in kg. per head of population.",
            "For each sex the average rates for intestinal cancer tend to rise as the coal consumption level for the group increases, whereas the stomach cancer rate tends to fall.",
            "The combined gastro-intestinal rates show no tendency to increase but the stomach/intestinal ratio falls step by step from 4-9 to 1 9 for males and from 2-8 to 1.0 for females, a consistent change even more remarkable than for cigarettes in Table III.",
            "The patterns are so similar that it is difficult to conceive of any explanation for the inverse behaviour of the intestine and stomach rates than the one already suggested, namely a limited proportion of people at a given age who are susceptible to gastro-intestinal cancer, about the same in all countries, and a preference by certain carcinogens including those in cigarettes and coal to promote malignancy in the intestine excluding the rectum, leading to more intestinal cancers and consequently fewer gastric cancers in the countries where prevalence of those carcinogens in the environment is high.",
            "Differences in ratios of gastric to duodenal ulcers, even if they followed a similar pattern, could not explain this since cancer occurs only rarely in the duodenum.",
            "Table II shows that the positive correlations between intestinal cancer rates and coal consumption were highly significant in both sexes (P < 0.001).",
            "When the same analytical procedure is applied to tea and coffee consumption in pounds per head of the population annually, Table V compares the associations with rates for the intestine and stomach in each sex.",
            "A contrast is evident in Table II, the intestine showing strong positive correlation for tea (P = 0-006 for males and 0 0001 for females), but no significant associations for coffee.",
            "Data of consumption were not available for Belgium or South Africa for either commodity, nor for Japan for tea, but Israel has been included giving 18 countries for tea and 19 for coffee.",
            "For tea the total gastro-intestinal rates show no appreciable variation but the intestinal rates are low for each sex in the countries with annual consumption below half a pound per head of population and high for each sex where the con- sumption exceeds 24 pounds per head.",
            "This suggests that a carcinogenic substance more likely to affect the intestine than the stomach is operative in connection with tea drinking as for cigarette smoking and the pollution of food by impurities derived from coal.",
            "The stomach/intestine ratios are notably greater in the low consumption areas than in the other areas for each sex.",
            "For coffee there is no indication of such an effect, neither the gastro-intestinal rates nor the stomach/ intestine ratios showing any association with consumption.",
            "Rectum (154)",
            "Positive associations occur in each sex with solid fuel consumption (P 0O5",
            "for females and 0O08, below confidence level, for males as shown in Table II), these being not as strong as for the rest of the intestine.",
            "A carcinogen from coal polluting ingested food appears to affect the intestine as a whole.",
            "With the other commodities the relations are weakly negative and insignificant.",
            "The three countries with notably high coal consumption, Belgium, United Kingdom and Germany all had high rates for cancer of the rectum (92, 92, 82 for males and 56, 55, 51 for females), but Denmark with the highest rates of all (115, 68) had an average solid fuel level (Table I).",

            "No positive associations appear for any of the commodities but there are negative relations with cigarettes, significant for males (P 0.05) but not for females.",
            "In both sexes low death rates occur in Britain and the Commonwealth countries together with high levels of tea consumption and this accounts for the slight negative relation with tea in females (P 0.08).",
            "Larynx (161 )",
            "The only significant associations in Table II are a positive one between female death rates and tea (P 0.05), and a negative one with coffee for the same sex (P 0.005).",

            "In a previous study of these commodities considered together in relation with male rates in 1958-59 in 19 countries it was found that each factor was correlated independently with the death rates at various ages.",
            "At 35-44 for example multiple coefficients as high as 0-8 resulted by combining the coefficients with smoking and air pollution in a ratio of 2 to 1 (Stocks, 1966).",
            "From another study of male rates in 20 countries in 1962-63 correlations of 0-38 and 0 70 at ages 55-64 were found with cigarettes and solid fuel respectively, and a partial coefficient of 0 45 with solid fuel when cigarette consumption was held constant (Stocks, 1967).",
            "It appears also that effects of smoking a given number of cigarettes tend to be greater in cities such as Liverpool where pollution by coal smoke is high (Stocks and Campbell, 1955).",
            "Table II shows that positive associations also exist between female death rates and solid fuel (P = 0.047) and, though not significantly, between those rates and cigarettes (P-0085).",
            "These have not been studied hitherto for different countries.",
            "It is not known however how far these correlations might be affected by differing proportions of women smokers and non-smokers in the various countries, since only the average consumption per adult person can be ascertained from excise data.",

            "Denmark had the highest death rates in 1964-65 in any of the European countries included in the 20 but the consumption of cigarettes there was below the median in 1951-54 (1182).",
            "No positive relations between death rates in 1964-65 and consumption of cigarettes 12 years before appear in the 20 countries (Table II).",
            "Solid fuel consumption is strongly correlated however with the death rates in each sex (P < 0.0001).",
            "The six countries with highest mortality were, for males, South Africa, Denmark, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Israel, Belgium (83,73,72,69,59, 59 per million) and for females Denmark, United Kingdom, Israel, Canada, Netherlands, Belgium (24, 20, 19, 18, 18, 18).",

            "Jobs in the smelter for which exposure to tar volatiles was essentially zero (notably maintenance, casting, and work in the chemical plant, where the bauxite ore was processed) accounted for a substantial proportion (about 40 010) of the workforce.",

            "The ratio was about one-tenth of the Soderberg value in the pre bake potroom and in the carbon plant.",

            "The relationship between cumulative exposure and the relative risk of bladder cancer was investigated with  1930-1954 1955-1959 1960-1964 1965-1969 1970-1974 1975  the use of conditional binary regression techniques for matched case-referent data (11), equivalent to Cox's proportional hazards model for survival data.",
            "The linear relative risk model was adopted for most of the analyses.",
            "This model assumes that relative risk R (more precisely odds ratio) is related to exposure x through the equation R = 1 + bx.",
            "The slope parameter b is estimated from the data and may be interpreted as the increase in relative risk per unit of exposure.",
            "In addition to exposure being considered a continuous variable in the preceding model, the subjects were divided into groups according to exposure, and the risk for each group was estimated relative to the lowest, also with the use of a matched analysis.",
            "The null hypotheses of no association between exposure and relative risk (b = 0) was tested with the likelihood ratio (LR) chi-squared test, and the 95 070 confidence intervals for b were also calculated by the LR method, which does not require that the estimate of b be normally distributed.",
            "The goodness of fit of models with the same number of parameters were com-488 pared through their LR statistics, a higher LR indicating a better fit (12).",
            "Somewhat informally, we refer these differences in LR statistics to the chi-squared distribution on one degree of freedom (df), following the argument that each model may be considered to be a special case of a more general' 'mixture\" model of the two combined (11).",
            "The relationship between cigarette smoking (Xl) and exposure to tar volatiles (x 2 ) was investigated with the use of linear multiplicative [R = (1 + blxt)(1 + br:JJ and additive (R = I + b.x, + b r2 )models, as de- scribed by Thomas (11).",
            "Since quantitative information on smoking was unavailable for many cases and referents, a simple indicator variable taking the value 1 for ever having been a cigarette smoker and 0 for never having been a cigarette smoker was used to represent smoking in the models used.",
            "The 12 referents with unknown smoking habits were excluded from these analyses.",
            "As there remained at least one referent for each case, matched analyses could still be carried out.",

            "Relative risk predicted by the models to follow from a given exposure may be calculated by the substitution of appropriate values of b and x in the equation R = 1 + bx; for example , a cumulative exposure of 100 /Lg/m 3 ' years of BaP is predicted to give rise (after 10 years of latency) to a relative risk of 1 + 0.023 x 100 = 3.3, according to the\" lO-year latency\" model.",
            "Smok ing was not importantly related to coal-tar pitch exposure among the referents (eg, 85 % of the referents who had ever worked in the potroom were smokers, compared with 80 % of other referents), so that we may assume that this was approximately the case in the smelter population as a whole.",
            "Thus smoking did not confound the relationship between coal-tar pitch volatiles and bladder cancer.",
            "The separate and combined effect of exposure to tar volatiles and cigarette smoking was estimated with the linear model for exposure to BSM and BaP, and under the assumptions (i) that the two factors act multiplicatively on relative risk and (ii) that they act additively.",

            "As indices of exposure we used total years spent in the potroom, and cumulative exposure to BSM and BaP, the only two components of tar to have been measured.",
            "Although years spent in the potroom is as effective a predictor of observed bladder cancers as the BSM or BaP indices (judged by likelihood ratio), it is unlikel y to be useful for predicting risk in the future or in other smelters, since, where environmental conditions differ, risk per year exposed is unlikely to be the same.",
            "BSM is an estimate essentially of all tar exposure.",
            "BaP was used in addition to BSM not because it was thought that BaP itself was likely to be the actual  Linear-multiplicative 2.12 0.Q18 34.9",

            "Linear-additive 2.01 0.044 31.7",
            "(1 + b,x, + b2x2)",
            "causal agent, but in the hope that it might be better correlated to the causal agent(s) than BSM overall.",
            "In particular, BaP is often taken as an indicator of total PAH.",
            "More than 30 different PAH have been identified in the work environment in aluminum smelters (2), many of them known to be carcinogenic in animals (6).",
            "However, the most plausible agents for bladder carcinogenesis known to be present in tar volatiles appear not to be the PAH but the aromatic amines (in particular 2-naphthylamine), which have been associated with bladder cancer in animal and human studies (5).",
            "The relation of concentrations of aromatic amines to BSM and BaP is not known.",
            "To the extent to which other environments have a ratio of the actual causative agent to BSM or to BaP which is similar to that in the aluminum smelters in this study, the estimates of risk per unit of BSM or BaP will be applicable.",
            "Thus we are the most confident in generalizing these results to other smelters using the Soderberg process, somewhat less so to smelters using the prebake process, and less still to environments contaminated with coal-tar pitch volatiles from other sources (eg, coke ovens).",
            "To extrapolate the results to completely different mixtures of hydrocarbons (eg, tobacco smoke) would not be sensible.",
            "Fitting a model with both BaP and BSM gives a likelihood ratio of 27.6 (compare 22.3 for BSM alone), giving a formal likelihood ratio test for BaP accounting for BSM of 5.3 on I df (p < 0.02).",
            "Thus there is some empirical evidence in these data that BaP is a better indicator of bladder cancer risk than BSM, but this evidence is not strong enough to be conclusive.",
            "Comparisons with other studies",
            "There are few studies with which we can compare our results.",
            "We know of no other ones investigating bladder cancer incidence among aluminum smelters.",
            "There have been mortality studies, but none have quantitative estimates of exposure in terms of concentration.",
            "Results from a cohort mortality study of workers in the main smelters included in this case-referent study (4) showed an increase in relative mortality per unit of exposure for bladder cancer compatible with the increase in relative incidence found in this study.",
            "However, this confirmatory evidence is limited, since (i) the total number of deaths due to bladder cancer was only 13 (so the sampling uncertainty in risk estimates was high) and (ii) exposure estimates were essentially the same as those used in this study.",
            "However there was little overlap between the deaths from the cohort and the cases from this case-referent study, so that to this extent the information is complementary.",
            "Uncertainties in estimating exposures",
            "In most if not all epidemiologic studies from which quantitative exposure-response relationships are estimated, the assessment of exposure is subject to con-siderable uncertainty.",
            "The estimates of exposure used for this study are based on a large number of environmental measurements and represent the result of careful work of experienced hygienists working at the largest smelter in the study (accounting for 73 of the 85 cases).",
            "The estimates must nevertheless be subject to some doubt, especially the early period.",
            "Estimates of air concentrations that are consistently too low or too high would bias estimates of the slope of the exposureresponse relationship up or down, respectively.",
            "Less obviously, random error in exposure estimates (equally often too high as too low) would bias the exposureresponse slope towards zero (1).",
            "Currently there is no satisfactory way to estimate the extent of this bias without knowledge of the distribution of the random error, which is unavailable.",
            "We are currently developing statistical methods which do not require this information, results from which will be published separately.",
            "As a preliminary exercise prior to this study, exposure-response relationships based on much cruder estimates of exposure were investigated.",
            "A comparison of these earlier results with those obtained from the more-detailed estimates of the present study highlights some of the problems related to exposure estimation.",
            "The preliminary analysis used estimates of cumulative exposure to BSM and BaP based on dividing jobs into five broad exposure categories assuming no change in exposure over time and assigning a representative exposure to each category.",
            "Results from this analysis are summarized in table 6.",
            "Although the crude and detailed exposure estimates were highly correlated (r = 0.82 for BaP and for BSM), the cruder estimates surprisingly achieved a significantly higher LR against the null hypothesis, the indication being that they might better reflect the true causal agent(s).",
            "The cruder estimate of BSM gave a considerably higher relative risk increment parameter b.",
            "Although this result does not imply that the cruder estimates were superior to the more detailed ones, it does when considered together with the higher LR, for the cruder measures suggest caution in predicting risk from mod- els for BSM.",
            "The difference between estimates of b for BaP exposure according to the two exposure estimates is much smaller, and for this reason we are somewhat more confident in predicting risk from BaP exposure.",
            "We are further investigating possible reasons for the greater predictive value of the cruder estimates, so far without discovering any clear pattern.",
            "Few, if any, similar studies have made more than one estimate of exposure, and it may be that this exercise simply serves to emphasize that such estimation is generally a highly uncertain procedure.",
            "Implications of study design",
            "The estimation of relative risk models from casereferent studies is known to be valid and has been used in other occupational contexts, for example, for asbestos exposure and lung cancer risk (11).",
            "The present study employed matching on duration of employment at a smelter in addition to the standard matching factors of date of birth, etc.",
            "Such matching is desirable to avoid confounding bias if duration of employment is a marker for risk other than through exposure to tar volatiles, but may constitute a form of overmatching (inappropriately diminishing potential differences in exposure between cases and referents) if not.",
            "Such overmatching would not introduce bias into estimates of exposure-response relationships if exposure were measured without error, although it would reduce precision (increase the width of the confidence intervals) compared to designs unmatched for duration of service.",
            "However, the biasing effects of random measurement error which were mentioned are likely to be more pronounced in the design matched for duration of service, since variation in true exposure among men with the same duration of exposure is more limited (1).",
            "In this study there was a great heterogeneity of exposure between jobs so that correlations between overall length of service and cumulative exposure to BSM (r = 0.29) and BaP (r = 0.22) were relatively low.",
            "In this situation the practical differences between designs matched and unmatched for duration of employment are probably not very great.",
            "Smoking",
            "The relative risk of three to four found in this study for having ever smoked is compatible with risks found in other studies (8).",
            "Given the small number of never smokers (6 cases and 46 referents) the power of our data is insufficient to discriminate strongly between the multiplicative and additive models for the combined effect of smoking and coal-tar exposure; however, there was some evidence, though falling short of conventional statistical significance, for the multiplicative model.",
            "Given the uncertainty concerning the possible effects of smoking, we propose that the results that we have presented for the group as a whole, 492 irrespective of smoking, be preferred for risk prediction, the fact always being born in mind that this group, like most working populations, included relatively few men who had never smoked.",
            "Latency",
            "Ideally it is desirable to identify the assumptions concerning latency which fit the data best, and to use these assumptions in formulating an exposure-response model.",
            "Unfortunately we have found that the data from this study (and we suspect from occupational epidemiologic studies generally) cannot discriminate between substantially different assumptions concerning latency.",
            "For example the difference in LR statistics between models based on all cumulative exposure and those based on the 10 years prior to diagnosis being ignored was only 3.0 (25.3 versus 22.3) for BSM, and 1.7 (29.1 versus 27.4) for BaP, neither suggesting any improvement more than could be accounted for by chance.",
            "More formal comparisons of different latency models yielded similarly inconclusive results.",
            "We suggest that the results following from the lO-year minimum latency assumption be preferred on a priori grounds, since environmental carcinogens generally, and occupational bladder carcinogens more particularly (8), are usually assumed to require some such minimum latency period.",
            "Estimated relative risk increments b from the minimum latency models are not importantly different from those based on total cumulative exposure, however.",
            "Form of exposure-response relationship",
            "The form of an exposure-response relationship (eg, linear, threshold, quadratic, exponential) may in theory either be chosen on a priori grounds or inferred from the data.",
            "However, as with latency, it was impossible to discriminate between importantly \"different models from our data.",
            "An exponential (logistic) model [R = exp(bx)] gave a likelihood ratio statistic which was marginally higher than that from the linear model for BSM, and marginally lower for BaP.",
            "The models based on grouped exposure data were all compatible with the linear model, although patterns of risk apparent from the grouped data, which are highly dependent on choice of group boundaries, may visually suggest nonlinear relationships.",
            "Our preference for the linear model is based on its compatibility with the data and its greater biological plausibility.",
            "Differences between forms of exposure-response relationships are the most important when risks from exposures much lower or much higher than those experienced in this study population are being predicted.",
            "Predicting risks",
            "We have mentioned many uncertainties and limitations in the models which we have estimated from our data, suggesting caution in predicting risk s from them.",
            "However, partial ignorance is no excuse for avoiding the important practical question of what risk fol1ows from what exposure.",
            "In the preceding discussion we argued that , for prediction, the linear model assuming a lO-year minimum latency be preferred.",
            "Relative risks, esti mated from this model, resulting from a worklife o f 40 years of exposure to coal-tar volatiles are sho wn in table 7 for a range of concentrations of BSM and BaP exposure.",
            "Note that the confidence intervals reflect onl y sam pling variability, and not the additional uncerta in ties that ha ve been discussed.",
            "In particular, the predictions of risk from low concen trations (say , th e lowest two given in the table) are hea vily dep endent on the lin ear ity assumption.",
            "We have commented that we were particularly cautious in predicting risk from BSM exposure.",
            "An alternative to using the model for BSM directly in predicting risk fo r a BSM concentration in a given environment is to estimate an average proportion of BaP in BSM in th at enviro nment and use the BaP model.",
            "An aluminum smelter worker exposed to coal-tar vo latiles at th e current American Conferen ce of Governmental Industrial H ygienists' threshold limit value (T LV) fo r BSM of 0.2 mg /rrr' fo r 40 years is predicted from the BSM model to be about two and a half tim es as likel y to co ntract bladder cancer as an unexpo sed per son .",
