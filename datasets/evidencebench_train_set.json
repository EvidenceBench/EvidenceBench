Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica, Rio de Janeiro, 14(Sup. 3): [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32]1998 Introduction Heavy consumption of red wine (Hoey et al., 1981;Falc\u00e3o et al., 1994) and the habit of drinking vodka ( Jedrychowski et al., 1986;Jedrychowski et al., 1993) have been shown to increase the risk for developing gastric cancer (GC) in case-control studies from France (Hoey et al., 1981), Portugal (Falc\u00e3o et al., 1994), and Poland ( Jedrychowski et al., 1986;Jedrychowski et al., 1993), respectively.",
            "In the United States, total ethanol consumption was associated with an increased risk of cancer in the gastric body, cardia, and fundus (Wu-Williams et al., 1990).",
            "In contrast, some prospective and other-case control studies performed in Europe and Asia did not find an association between total alcohol consumption and GC (Kono & Hirohata, 1996).",
            "Some studies focused on potential differences regarding the anatomic site of GC, while the histological type of the tumor has scarcely been evaluated in relation to alcohol intake.",
            "Furthermore, no information has been published for Latin American countries, where GC is one of most frequent malignant neoplasms (WHO, 1970).",
            "This paper presents the results of an assessment of alcohol consumption, including the popular liquor tequila (a Mexican spirit distilled from the juice of a specific cactus), in relation to GC incidence and its histological types, using data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Mexico City.",
            "Methods",
            "Detailed information about the study has been published elsewhere (L\u00f3pez-Carrillo et al., 1994).",
            "In short, our study population comprised 220 newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed cases of adenocarcinoma of the stomach from fifteen large hospitals and 752 population-based controls from the Greater Mexico City Metropolitan Area.",
            "The cases represented some 80 percent of the stomach cancer cases reported to the Mexican National Cancer Registry by hospitals in Greater Mexico City during the study period.",
            "Sociodemographic characteristics and frequency and amount of consumption of 79 food items, including 5 alcoholic beverages, were recorded through structured personal interviews.",
            "Direct interviews were performed in 78% of the cases; the remaining cases were seriously ill, and the interview had to be done with the spouse, a daughter, or a son.",
            "To bal-ance this situation, 7% of the controls were randomly selected for indirect interviews with equivalent surrogate responders.",
            "Cases were asked about their alcohol and food consumption over a 12-month period before the onset of symptoms, while controls were asked about the same habits in the 12-month period preceding the interview.",
            "It is our assumption that alcohol and dietary habits during these periods reflected longer-term adult dietary habits.",
            "Alcohol consumption and smoking",
            "A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate the consumption of beer, wine, brandy, rum, and tequila.",
            "The ethanol content was estimated in grams, using the Food Intake Analysis System 3.0 software.",
            "To estimate ethanol intake, the following equivalencies were used: one drink (1 oz or 30 ml) of tequila = 14.03 g of ethanol; one drink (200 ml can/bottle) of beer = 12.96 g; one drink (60 ml) of wine = 9.58 g; and one drink of rum or brandy (30 ml) = 14.03 g of ethanol.",
            "Smoking was measured as a score of lifetime exposure, multiplying the current and/or past average daily number of cigarettes smoked times years' duration of the habit (cigarettes/ day x years of smoking).",
            "Other risk factors for gastric cancer",
            "Intake of foods potentially related to GC was measured as follows: for chili pepper, all subjects were asked to rate their own level of consumption as none, low, medium, or high.",
            "Information on frequency of consumption of 17 fruits was grouped as one single variable representing daily consumption.",
            "The same procedure was used for 13 vegetables and 4 processed meats.",
            "Salt intake was measured as a dichotomous variable, whether or not the subject habitually added salt to meals before tasting them.",
            "Socioeconomic status was determined as a function of having sewage disposal and/or running supply in the household.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "The effects of known and potential risk factors for GC according to three categories of alcohol intake were assessed in our sample by means of t-tests and/or \u03c7 2 statistics.",
            "Potential interactions between alcohol consumption and each of the GC risk factors were assessed by looking at the change in the likelihood ratio statistic for the interaction term of interest (i.e., grams of alcohol intake times the particular variable) in the logistic regression models for GC.",
            "Adjusted odds ratios for the effects of total ethanol and individual intake of beer, wine, and distilled alcoholic drinks on GC risk were obtained by fitting unconditional multivariate logistic models to the data.",
            "These models were estimated for adenocarcinomas of the stomach and each histological type of GC (i.e. intestinal and diffuse) including known and potential risk factors for gastric cancer (age, sex, total calories, consumption of chili pepper, fruits, vegetables, salt, and processed meats, plus cigarette smoking, socioeconomic status, and history of peptic ulcer).",
            "The existence of linear trends for particular types of alcoholic drinks and total ethanol (in grams) in relation to GC risk was assessed taking each categorical alcoholic beverage at a time as a continuous variable in the multivariate logistic regression models.",
            "All analyses were performed using the software STATA 5.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas).",
            "Results",
            "Table 1 shows the selected characteristics of the study population.",
            "As expected by design (age frequency matching), mean ages for cases and controls were almost identical, around 58 years.",
            "There was a significant excess of women in the control group (60.6% vs. 44.5%).",
            "Average calorie intake was similar in the study population.",
            "In contrast, there was a significantly higher proportion of alcohol consumers among cases as compared to controls, with a significantly higher daily consumption of total ethanol (7.3 g among cases vs. 4.0 g among controls) and ethanol from beer (5.5 g among cases vs. 2.9 g among controls).",
            "Ethanol consumption from wine and distilled alcoholic beverages was not statistically different among cases and controls.",
            "According to histological type, there were similar proportions of intestinal and diffuse tumors among the cases.",
            "Table 2 shows the age-, sex-, and calorieadjusted odds ratios for the effects of known and suspected GC factors, according to three categories of alcohol consumption.",
            "Among alcohol abstainers, we found a protective effect of vegetable and fruit consumption, which was independent of alcohol consumption (i.e. this protective effect was evident for both teetotalers and alcohol consumers).",
            "No interaction was found between alcohol consumption and vegetable or fruit consumption.",
            "Likewise, an increased risk due to consumption of salt, processed meats, and chili pepper was detected among non-alcohol drinkers.",
            "In the presence of alcohol consumption, the effect of salt and chili pepper on GC risk was smaller, while the effect of processed meat intake remained similar to that observed for teetotalers.",
            "None of these three factors (salt, processed meats, and, chili pepper) showed a significant interaction with alcohol consumption in relation to GC risk.",
            "Smoking increased GC risk among both teetotalers and those who consumed less than 5g of alcohol per day, while the opposite effect was observed among individuals who consumed more than 5g of alcohol per day.",
            "The interaction term for smoking and alcohol intake did not reach statistical significance.",
            "Multivariate models for the effect of ethanol and the preferred alcoholic beverages consumption on GC risk are shown in Table 3.",
            "Total ethanol consumption increased the risk of developing GC up to 1.93 times for those who consumed \u2265 5 g (95% CI 1.00-3.71) every day, with a borderline significant test for trend (p = 0.068).",
            "Neither beer nor distilled beverages had a significant effect on GC.",
            "In contrast, wine consumption produced a significantly in- creased risk of GC (OR \u2265 1 drink of wine per day vs. non-wine consumers = 2.93 95% CI 1.27-6.75) independently of known factors for this malignant tumor and other alcoholic beverages (beer and distilled).",
            "The increased risk of GC due to wine consumption held for both histological types (intestinal: OR = 2.16, CI 95% 0.68-6.92, p-value for trend = 0.031; and diffuse: OR = 4.48, CI 95% 1.44-13.94, p-value for trend = 0.018).",
            "No significant increase in GC risk was observed for total ethanol or any other alcoholic beverage consumption among GC cases by histological type (Table 4).",
            "Discussion",
            "The results of this study show that wine consumption is positively associated with the risk of developing gastric cancer (OR = 2.93; CI 95% 1.27-6.75), and this association remained among intestinal (OR = 2.16; CI 95% 0.68-6.92, p-value for trend = 0.031) and diffuse (OR = 4.48; CI 95% 1.44-13.94, p-value for trend = 0.018) gastric cancer cases.",
            "This effect was in-dependent of other known risk factors for this neoplasm with a statistically significant monotonic trend, suggesting that risk increases along with wine consumption.",
            "Consumption of beer and distilled alcoholic beverages including brandy, rum, and tequila was not associated with GC risk and, and a borderline significant trend between GC risk and total ethanol intake was observed.",
            "Our results are in line with the findings of two published studies from France (Hoey et al., 1981) and Portugal (Falc\u00e3o et al., 1994).",
            "In the former country an odds ratio of 6.9 (CI 95% 3.3-14.3), was estimated for the effect of 568 grams of alcohol (i.e., ethanol) consumption or more per week on the GC risk, with an apparent dose response relationship; the authors mention that alcohol consumption in their study population was mainly wine intake.",
            "Likewise, the study from Portugal reported an odds ratio of 2.61 (CI 95% 1.01-6.78) for subjects with a weekly intake of more than 559g of red wine and a significant trend in regard to increasing amounts of red wine intake.",
            "Two studies from Poland also found a positive association between alcohol consumption, specifically that vodka, with GC (Jedrychowski et al., 1986;Jedrychowski et al., 1993).",
            "The authors reported a three-fold increase in GC risk for those drinking vodka at least once a weak ( Jedrychowski et al., 1993), as well as for subjects drinking alcohol on an empty stomach, that is, before breakfast.",
            "Some methodological features must be taken into account when interpreting the results of our study.",
            "The assessment of ethanol and each specific alcoholic beverage in regard to histological type of tumor was limited by the sample size.",
            "Hence, the lack of a statistically significant trend among intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer cases in relation to their consumption of total ethanol, wine, and distilled beverages might be the result of an insufficient number of cases.",
            "Differential recall from cases and controls cannot be entirely ruled out, because the possibility does exist that the cases could have answered in a different fashion than controls, perhaps attributing their illness to alcohol consumption.",
            "It also possible that there was some degree of underreporting of alcohol consumption on the side of the controls, but the latter situation is unlikely given that both interviewers and interviewees unaware of the hypothesis being tested.",
            "We can not entirely rule out differential reporting; nonetheless, had this problem been present (specifically among the cases) we should have obtained similar patterns for red wine consumption and other beverages such as brandy or tequila, which are much more commonly consumed in Mexico.",
            "Moreover, when consumption of other dietary items like vegetables, processed meats, and salt was being assessed, the patterns of results were always in the expected direction; hence, it seems unlikely that either cases or controls could have influenced the results, for a particular factor, in a specific direction.",
            "The method of control selection favored the recruitment of women and persons who tended to stay at home.",
            "Selection bias would have occurred if alcohol consumption were associated with gender and/or the fact of staying at home.",
            "However, the models were adjusted by sex, and inclusion of occupation (housewife, retired, and unemployed vs. all other oc-",
            "This study was supported by grants from the Mexican Secretariat of Health, the American Institute for Cancer Research, and Glaxo Laboratories.",
            "cupations) in the multivariate models did not change the results.",
            "On the other hand, the control group was accrued by visiting households selected from a sampling frame specifically devised for the National Health Survey of 1987; the latter means that our control group was a random sample of the subjects living in Mexico City at the time of the study.",
            "Therefore, overall prevalence of alcohol consumption among controls (37.9%) was similar to that reported a year later by the National Addictions Survey (31.2%) (DGE, 1990) and lower than the prevalence expected for subjects attending the health services.",
            "Use of a population-based control group helps explain why even at a low level of wine consumption we were able to detect an association, in contrast to the much higher levels of wine consumption observed for both cases and controls in the European studies.",
            "Another important difference with those studies was that our referent category comprised only total abstainers, while they combined the latter subjects reporting a low level of wine consumption.",
            "Currently, there are at least two plausible mechanisms regarding the carcinogenic potential of alcohol.",
            "One is that ethanol induces di-rect damage to the cell membrane; therefore, epithelia that come into contact with alcohol more frequently should be more likely to display such an effect.",
            "This hypothesis has been cited as an explanation for the associations between alcohol consumption and cancer of the mouth, oropharynx, larynx, and stomach (Rothman, 1995).",
            "The second causal pathway implies that, besides ethanol, alcoholic beverages contain other compounds which in turn are responsible for the carcinogenic effect.",
            "Such is the case for nitrosamine precursors found in apple brandy and cider (Walker et al., 1979).",
            "It is worth mentioning that the content of non-ethanol compounds varies among the different types of alcoholic beverages as well as among countries, and these facts could partly explain the differences observed in the studies published so far.",
            "On the other hand, a limitation of our study was the inability to distinguish among different kinds of wine.",
            "Finally, the results of our study point to the need for carrying out further research on the issue of alcohol consumption and the incidence of gastric cancer, even among populations with moderate to low levels of exposure.",

            "INTRODUCTION",
            "Viruses have been proposed to play an etiologic role in human cancers.",
            "JC virus (JCV) is a polyomavirus that ubiquitously infects humans worldwide, and more than 80% of the adult population carries antibodies against the virus [1] . JCV has been implicated in various types of human cancers [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] .",
            "It has been reported that JCV sequences are frequently present throughout the normal human gastrointestinal tract and in colorectal and gastric cancers [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] .",
            "JCV encodes a transforming gene, T-antigen (T-Ag), which is believed to mediate the oncogenic potential of the virus.",
            "T-Ag protein expression was specifically present in the nuclei of colon cancer cells, but not in any adjacent normal colonic epithelium [8] .",
            "Previous studies have identified multiple pathways including p53, pRb, IRS, NF1/NF2 and \u03b2-catenin, which may be dysregulated by T-Ag [4,10,11] .",
            "T-Ag can bind and inactivate p53, pRb, and the spindle assembly checkpoint protein Bub1, resulting in disruption of chromosomal integrity and cell cycle checkpoints [12,13] .",
            "T-Ag can also bind and stabilize \u03b2-catenin [4,11] .",
            "T-Ag protein expression, rather than the simple presence of JCV DNA sequences, has been significantly associated with chromosomal instability (CIN) and the methylator phenotype in colorectal cancers [8] .",
            "The possible involvement in aberrant methylation is thought to provide a secondary link to microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal cancers [8] .",
            "Therefore, it has been suggested that JCV is involved in colorectal cancers through multiple mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic alterations [8] . Bhattacharyya et al [14] recently reported the interplay between \u03b2-catenin and Rac1 that is initiated by T-Ag and results in stabilization of \u03b2-catenin and its presence in cell membrane ruffles.",
            "T-Ag and \u03b2-catenin synergistically activate Rac1, an event that can trigger several oncogenic factors [14] .",
            "The association between T-Ag expression and aberrant promoter methylation in colorectal cancers suggests that this viral oncogene induces the methylator phenotype [8] . Genomic methylation is a host defense mechanism that silences the transcription of transposons and retroviruses that have accumulated in the mammalian genome [8,15,16] .",

            "In the course of recent studies from our laboratory, the presence in liver nuclei of anaerobic enzymatic pathways of biotransformation of ethanol to acetaldehyde was reported.",
            "This biotransformation process required the presence of NADPH as cofactor and it was significantly enhanced by the simultaneous presence of FAD in the incubation mixture (Castro et al., 1998).",
            "These results prompted us to postulate that cytochrome P450 reductase might be involved in this pathway of ethanol biotransformation (Castro et al., 1998).",
            "Previous studies employing reconstituted systems evidenced that P450 reductase is able to oxidize ethanol under air in the presence of NADPH and in the absence of cytochrome P450 in an iron stimulated process, involving the formation of reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals (Ohnishi and Lieber, 1978; Winston and Cederbaum, 1983, 1986).",
            "In those studies, the authors did not attempt to verify whether an anaerobic process might also occur.",
            "In the present study, we describe the strictly anaerobic possibility of pure P450 reductase to bioactivate ethanol to 1-hydroxyethyl free radicals and acetaldehyde and the possibility for this pathway to participate in liver microsomal and nuclear anaerobic biotransformation of alcohol.",

            "P450 Red was able to biotransform ethanol under air, as already known (Ohnishi and Lieber, 1978; Winston and Cederbaum, 1983, 1986), but it was also able to produce acetaldehyde under an oxygen-free nitrogen atmosphere in a process that required NADPH as cofactor (Table 1\n).",
            "When FAD was included in the incubation mixture, the production of acetaldehyde was significantly enhanced and it can be seen that the reaction is able to proceed anaerobically in the presence of FAD and NADPH, even in the absence of P450 Red (Table 1).",

            "Discussion",
            "In agreement with the hypothesis that P450 reductase might bioactivate ethanol to acetaldehyde under strictly anaerobic conditions in a process requiring NADPH (Castro et al., 1998), the present experiments using the pure enzyme as the only component in oxygen-free incubation mixtures fully confirmed that possibility.",
            "No acetaldehyde formation was observed in the absence of NADPH.",
            "The simultaneous formation of 1HEt radicals in the process suggests that the latter is involved in the production of acetaldehyde and also that the bioactivation of ethanol to the 1HEt might involve the flavosemiquinone state of the enzyme.",
            "In effect, NADPH-P450 reductase is a flavoprotein containing 1 mol each of FAD and FMN (FAD-E-FMN) (Iyanagni and Mason, 1973; Williams, 1976).",
            "Electron transfer proceeds from NADPH to FAD to FMN (Opsian and Coon, 1982; Strobel et al., 1995).",
            "This process was thoroughly studied and involves the existence of several unpaired electron-containing semiquinone forms e.g. [FADH-E-FMN], [FAD-E-FMNH]; [FADH-E-FMNH], [FADH-E-FMH2] and [FADH2-E-FMNH] (Opsian and Coon, 1982; M\u00fcller, 1987).",
            "These semiquinone forms might be involved in the generation of 1HEt from EtOH.",
            "That possibility is further suggested by our studies using pure FAD, which are useful to gain an insight into the chemical behavior of the flavin moiety.",
            "In those studies we found that reduced FAD is able to generate 1HEt.",
            "Under this proposed mechanism, acetaldehyde would arise from a rearrangement of the 1HEt by splitting of a hydrogen atom.",
            "We observed that the reducing agent might be either NADPH or NADH.",
            "However under biological conditions NADPH would be the preferred source of reducing equivalent to P450 reductase (reviews in J\u00e4ning and Pfeil, 1984; Strobel et al., 1995).",
            "The interaction of ethanol with the enzyme when it is in its proper membrane site might be at its hydrophilic domain protruding the membrane surface rather than at the hydrophobic one holding the molecule in the membrane.",
            "This possibility is more likely than the opposite in view of the hydrophilic nature of ethanol.",
            "In addition that site also contains the binding site for the cosubstrate transferring the electron to the flavins (J\u00e4ning and Pfeil, 1984; Strobel et al., 1995).",
            "Our studies using specific antibody evidenced that these P450 reductase-mediated pathways of ethanol biotransformation to acetaldehyde and 1HEt may also operate when the enzyme is either in the microsomal or in the nuclear membrane (Philips and Langdon, 1962; Williams and Kamin, 1962; Kasper, 1971).",
            "In the presence of oxygen, P450 reductase may also directly oxidize ethanol via a different mechanism involving the formation of oxygen reactive species and both in the absence or in the presence of adequate cytochrome P450 isoforms (e.g. CYP2E1) (Ohnishi and Lieber, 1978; Winston and Cederbaum, 1983, 1986).",
            "In tissues where those P450 isoforms are not present or they are in non-significant proportions, a direct P450 reductase mediated pathway may be operating.",
            "In this context it may be worth considering that P450 reductase has no known isoforms (J\u00e4ning and Pfeil, 1984; Strobel et al., 1995) and that it was found to be present not only in the liver endoplasmic reticulum but also in the nuclear membrane (Kasper, 1971) and that it was evidenced to be widely distributed throughout the constituent tissues of most mammals and even other species (Villarruel et al., 1977; J\u00e4ning and Pfeil, 1984).",
            "A potential additional implication of the present observations might be that other flavoproteins of the dehydrogenase or reductase classes were able to activate ethanol to acetaldehyde and 1HEt.",
            "In effect, this class of flavoproteins utilize the flavosemiquinone state and react rapidly with electron acceptors, while the other two classes of flavoenzymes (e.g. oxidases and monooxygenases) do not (M\u00fcller, 1987).",
            "That possibility, however, remains to be confirmed.",

            "The objective was to assess the risk of HIV transmission from orogenital intercourse (OI).",
            "Methods Systematic review of the literature on HIV-1 infectiousness through OI conducted according to MOOSE guidelines for reviews of observational studies.",
            "The PubMed database and bibliographies of relevant articles were searched to July 2007.",
            "Results",
            "Of the titles, 56 214 were searched from which 10 potentially appropriate studies were identified; two additional studies were identified through bibliographies and one through discussion with experts.",
            "There were 10 included studies, providing estimates of transmission probabilities per-partner (n = 5), incidence per-partner (n = 3), per-study participant (n = 3, following initially seronegative individuals whose partners are of unknown serostatus) and per-act (n = 3).",
            "Only four of 10 studies reported non-zero estimates: two per-partner estimates (20%, 95% CI: 6\u201351, n = 10 and a model-based estimate, 1%, range 0.85\u20132.3%), one per-study participant estimate (0.37%, 95% CI: 0.10\u20131.34%) and one per-act estimate (0.04%, 95% CI: 0.01\u20130.17%).",
            "Upper bounds for the 95% CI for zero estimates tended to be relatively large due to the small study sample sizes: 9.0, 12.1 and 2.8% for per-partner; 4.7, 9.6 and 1.8 per 100 person-years for incidence per-partner; 4.4% per-study participant and 0.45 and 0.02% for per-act.",
            "Given the small number of studies, a meta-analysis was not considered appropriate.",
            "Conclusions",
            "There are currently insufficient data to estimate precisely the risk from OI exposure.",
            "The low risk of transmission evident from identified studies means that more and larger studies would be required to provide sufficient evidence to derive more precise estimates.",
            "Introduction",
            "The risk of HIV transmission through orogenital intercourse (OI) has yet to be precisely quantified.",
            "Various case reports suggest that the risk of OI transmission is not nil but much lower than from vaginal and anal intercourse (AI).",
            "While some of these reports may have been misattributed to OI transmission through underreporting of higher risk behaviours such as AI, this is unlikely to be true for all cases of reported OI transmission.",
            "It is important to quantify this probability because some confusion about the risks associated with these practices remains.",
            "Based solely on the evidence from case reports, current guidelines tend to be very cautious and suggest 100% condom use and use of dental dams.",
            "More precise information on the actual risk would help clinicians to advise their patients on the relative risks.",
            "This may be especially important as the relative contribution of OI may have increased because other higher risk activities, such as unprotected receptive AI (URAI), have become less common.",
            "More precise transmission probability estimates would improve predictions of the contribution of OI exposure to HIV incidence that has previously been estimated to be up to 8% in some populations in industrialized countries.",
            "The risk of OI transmission is difficult to assess.",
            "Most studies focused on men who have sex with men (MSM), and since many men have varied sexual practices, risks of transmission from low-risk sexual practices such as OI have been difficult to detect.",
            "Furthermore, there is a range of OI practices that likely carry different risks, but risks for specific OI practices are difficult to quantify because many individuals practice multiple types of OI (as well as higher risk activities such as vaginal and anal sex).",
            "Here, we define OI to include both insertive and receptive penile-oral sex between males and between males and females, as well as vaginal-oral sex between females and between male and females, but to exclude oroanal contact.",
            "While Rothenberg et al. reviewed case reports and epidemiological association studies up to the beginning of 1998 reporting OI risk for HIV transmission, ours is the first study systematically to review the evidence on transmission probability estimates for receptive and insertive unprotected OI.",
            "Methods",
            "The systematic review was undertaken following MOOSE guidelines for reviews of observational studies.",
            "Search strategy",
            "The PubMed database was searched to July 2007 using the following search terms and Boolean operators, for matches under any field: (HIV OR LAV OR HTLV III OR HTLV-III OR AIDS OR human immunodeficiency virus OR human T-lymphotropic virus III OR acquired immunodeficiency) AND {infectiousness OR infectivity OR probability OR contact OR contacts OR partner OR partners OR wives OR spouses OR husbands OR couples OR discordant OR [transmission AND (heterosexual OR homosexual OR risk OR female OR male OR anal)]}.",
            "Titles and available abstracts were scanned for relevance, identifying papers requiring further consideration.",
            "Bibliographies of relevant articles were checked and experts in the field were approached in order to identify additional relevant publications.",
            "Selection criteria and data extraction",
            "Due to the small number of studies on OI transmission probability estimates, the review included empirical studies and also statistical model-based estimates (Bernouilli models) using datasets involving partners with multiple exposure types [e.g. OI, URAI and unprotected insertive AI (UIAI)], aiming to delineate the contribution of each sexual activity to the overall transmissions observed in the sample.",
            "Four types of estimate were included: (i) per-act (one OI act); (ii) per-partner (multiple OI acts over the total duration of a sexual partnership with an infected individual); (iii) per-partner incidence (multiple OI acts over a specified duration within a sexual partnership with an infected individual) and (iv) per-seronegative study participant (studies following up initially HIV negative individuals reporting unprotected OI exposure as their sole risk factor, with one or more partners of positive or unknown serostatus).",
            "There was no other restriction by study design or language of publication.",
            "Each relevant publication was examined by two investigators (R.F.B., R.G.W.) to extract available information on estimates and study and participant characteristics.",
            "Two of the three authors contacted replied; authors of one study provided additional information.",
            "Quantitative data synthesis",
            "For uniformity, all confidence intervals (CIs) were recalculated using the Wilson \u2018score\u2019 method without continuity correction except for Samuel et al. and Vittinghoff et al., which reported lowest and highest estimates from a sensitivity analysis based on various model assumptions, and the per-partner incidence estimate from de Vincenzi 1994, where the number of person-years exposure was not stated and, therefore, the published CI are shown.",
            "Results",
            "Of the titles 56 214 were searched from which 10 potentially appropriate studies were identified; two additional studies were identified through bibliographies and one through discussion with experts.",
            "There were 10 included studies that provided five per-partner, three per-partner incidence, three per-study participant and three per-act estimates (with further estimates subdivided by direction of transmission and type of OI act).",
            "A flowchart summary of the search is shown in Figure 1.",
            "Three publications were excluded.",
            "Results from two prospective studies reported in Kingsley et al. and Raiteri et al. were superseded by Detels et al. and Raiteri et al., respectively, which reported results with longer durations of follow-up in each case.",
            "Winkelstein et al. was excluded because there was no previous HIV negative test to exclude those with URAI exposure from 2 years earlier (HIV prevalence was as high as 18.2% among those with no OI or AI contact in the last 2 years).",
            "Forest plots summarizing estimates for each transmission probability type are presented in Figure 2.",
            "Details for each study are shown in Table 1.",
            "All studies were from industrialized countries and most reported zero seroconversions (Table 1).",
            "All but two studies reported no unprotected sexual activity other than unprotected OI, but subjects often practised protected vaginal or AI.",
            "Vittinghoff et al.9 and Samuel et al.8 were able to derive model based estimates using data from MSM with various risk factors including URAI and UIAI.",
            "Samuel et al. inferred the unknown HIV status of index partners from MSM prevalence data.",
            "None of the MSM who exclusively reported OI as a risk factor seroconverted in Vittinghoff et al.'s study.",
            "Vittinghoff et al. calculated a per-act risk for infected or unknown serostatus partners because there were too few cases of OI contact with known infected partners in their dataset.",
            "Raiteri et al. followed a cohort of HIV discordant lesbian couples who reported oroanal as well as orogenital contact; there were no seroconversions.",
            "There were five non-zero estimates (two per-partner, two per-study participant and one per-act).",
            "The two non-zero per-partner estimates were 1% (range 0.85\u20132.3%) for receptive OI (ROI) and 20% (95% CI: 5.7\u201351.0%) for fellatio.",
            "The very high estimate by Giesecke et al. was based on only 10 heterosexual and homosexual discordant couples where the seronegative partner reported no concurrent or subsequent seropositive partner, no intravenous drug use and only OI exposure over follow-up.",
            "The high estimate may be due to underreporting of higher risk activity, or simply due to chance.",
            "Vittinghoff et al. reported a 0.04% risk per-act from men-to-men for unprotected ROI (UROI).",
            "Two per-study participant studies among MSM reported non-zero transmission probabilities for all OI and ROI in the absence of practising AI in the previous 12 and 6 months, respectively, but the number of partners and their serostatus were not determined.",
            "Therefore, as the exposure and the risk of infection depend on HIV prevalence in the population, these results cannot be generalized to other settings.",
            "Similar limitations apply to Vittinghoff et al.'s estimate, which reflects a risk per-act with sexual partners of infected or unknown serostatus and, therefore, very likely underestimates transmission probability per-act per infected partner for UROI.",
            "No study among heterosexuals reported transmission by OI, except possibly Giesecke et al., where the characteristics of the 10 couples were not stated (59 homosexual and 71 heterosexual couples comprised all discordant couples identified by the study).",
            "Due to the differences across studies and uncertainty regarding the quality of the estimates due to small sample sizes and misclassification biases due to difficulties in isolating OI as the only source of exposure, it was deemed inappropriate to pool study estimates by transmission types.",
            "Discussion",
            "Very few studies reporting HIV transmission probabilities through OI or reporting sufficient data to calculate it were found.",
            "This may be due to the difficulty in identifying individuals with OI as their sole exposure, the tendency to ascribe any transmission events that occur to any higher risk exposure that is identified, such as AI, and the assumption that the associated risk is very low.",
            "Although transmission risk per-act or per-partner through any type of OI activity remains poorly quantified and despite the high estimate from Giesecke et al., our review suggests a low but non-zero transmission probability.",
            "Where OI exposure with no other HIV risk factors is reported, there are the possibilities of both social desirability bias and recall bias leading to underreporting of higher risk behaviour, which may lead to overestimation of transmission probability estimates.",
            "Celum et al. stated that in their study most men reporting UROI also reported protected AI and that for such studies that rely on self-reported behavioural data, \u2018some seroconverters may not have recognized condom failure and others may have over-reported condom use, which could result in over-attribution of HIV transmission to oral sexual exposure\u2019.",
            "In a MSM cohort study, Keet et al. reported that of 20 men denying receptive AI (RAI) in the 6\u20139 months prior to seroconversion in written questionnaires, 11 later reported this practice in face-to-face interviews.",
            "Conversely, transmission probability estimates from discordant couple studies such as de Vincenzi may be low and underestimate infectiousness because index partners are likely to be in the incubation period, after the period of high infectiousness during primary infection.",
            "Different types of OI are likely to have different risks for HIV transmission.",
            "The report of a working group of the UK Chief Medical Officers' Expert Advisory Group on AIDS suggested that, \u2018it would seem reasonable to assume that ejaculation increases the extent of exposure to HIV and that avoiding it may help reduce the risk of HIV transmission\u2019.",
            "Again, there are insufficient data to investigate this assumption.",
            "Del Romero et al. provide per-partner estimates by type of act and direction of transmission, but there were no seroconversions in this study. 19",
            "Studies reporting risk per-study participant, where number of partners and the serostatus of partners for each participant were often not available, were included in this review because of the limited number of studies reporting any type of OI risk estimate.",
            "However, such studies may suffer additional reporting bias, as seroconversions from study participants with no risk factor other than OI are notable because such events are rare and, therefore, their occurrence may increase the likelihood of reports from cohorts mentioning them.",
            "For per-act infectiousness, Vittinghoff et al. could only quantify the OI risk per partner infected or of unknown serostatus, which would be an underestimate of risk per infected partner.9",
            "Given the small number of studies, a meta-analysis was not considered appropriate as many zero estimates might have occurred because of the small sample size, the low risk of transmission through OI and the increased influence of misclassification biases.",
            "The low risk of transmission means large and expensive studies would be required to provide useful evidence to supply more precise estimates.",
            "Such estimates are important for prevention and counselling of individual patients.",
            "The relative contribution of OI to HIV transmission, despite its inherent low infectiousness, may be substantial if the frequency of unprotected OI is increasing relative to higher risk sexual practices, which may be protected.",
            "Nevertheless, the fact that infected study participants with solely this exposure have remained difficult to identify may suggest that indeed the contribution of OI to HIV incidence remains low.",
            "The contribution of OI to HIV incidence needs close monitoring and opportunities for further transmission probability studies should be identified and utilized in order to give greater understanding of this neglected mode of transmission."

            "Using DNA extracted from thymomas, PCR amplification experiments for HTLV-I (pol and tax) and HFV (gag and bel1) were all negative.",
            "These experiments were performed twice for each specimen (once without positive controls, followed by once with positive controls), with complete concordance.",
            "Figure 1 shows results from experiments with positive controls, using primers from HTLV-I pol (panel A) and HFV bel1 (panel B).",
            "In these experiments, serial dilutions of the positive control DNA demonstrated that PCR could identify three HTLV-I copies and 10 HFV copies per reaction (Figure 1).",
            "By ELISA, 14 of 14 thymoma patients and 19 of 20 blood donor controls were HTLV-I/II seronegative, while one blood donor (BD15) was HTLV-I/II seropositive.",
            "By Western blot, none of the 35 evaluated subjects was HTLV-I or HTLV-II seropositive.",
            "Indeterminate Western blots were observed in five thymoma patients (36%) and nine blood donors (45%); in most of these subjects, reactivity was weak (Figure 2).",
            "Among thymoma patients with indeterminate Western blots, two had reactivity to env but not gag, and three had reactivity to gag but not env.",
            "Among blood donors, five had reactivity to env but not gag, and one had reactivity to gag but not env.",
            "Two blood donors (BD5 and BD15) had reactivity to both gag and env (but this reactivity did not meet our criteria for Western blot positivity), and one donor had reactivity only to Western blot proteins other than gag and env.",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "HTLV-I and foamy viruses infrequently cause infections in humans but can integrate into and disrupt the host genome, making them potentially attractive agents for causing rare cancers such as thymoma.",
            "Nonetheless, using samples obtained from US patients, we were unable to confirm prior reports that either HTLV-I or HFV DNA is present in thymoma tumour tissue.",
            "The single prior report of HTLV-I detection in thymoma was from Italy.",
            "In that study, Manca et al tested thymic tissue from 27 patients with myasthenia gravis (12 with thymoma, 15 with thymic hyperplasia).",
            "A DNA sequence corresponding to the HTLV-I regulatory gene tax was amplified from most cases (92% of thymomas, 93% of thymic hyperplasia specimens), whereas DNA corresponding to the structural gene pol was found in fewer tissues (75% of thymomas, 40% of thymic hyperplasia specimens).",
            "Additionally, sera from 83 other myasthenia gravis patients were studied by the same group.",
            "All were negative for HTLV-I/II antibodies by ELISA.",
            "A total of 17 sera were evaluated further by Western blot, and all showed antibody reactivity against recombinant HTLV-I/II p21 envelope protein, consistent with an indeterminate HTLV-I serology (only two showed reactivity against the gag protein p19).",
            "The reasons why our findings regarding HTLV-I, which were convincingly negative, differ from those of Manca et al are unclear.",
            "Although a limitation of our study was its small size and the selection of patients from a single referral institution, our study included thymoma patients from various demographic categories and tumour subtypes.",
            "We amplified the same two HTLV-I gene regions as Manca et al did, and one primer set (SK43/SK44) was the same in both studies.",
            "In our experiments, we would have detected as few as three HTLV-I pol or tax copies in 500\u2009ng genomic DNA, equivalent to one copy per 25\u2009000 cells, had the virus been present.",
            "Thus, our assays were sufficiently sensitive to rule out the presence of HTLV-I in these specimens.",
            "Similarly, we did not find evidence for a specific HTLV-I or HTLV-II antibody pattern in thymoma patients.",
            "One blood donor control had a positive ELISA result and indeterminate Western blot, suggesting that he might have been exposed to or infected with HTLV-I or HTLV-II.",
            "All other subjects were ELISA negative, and overall, equivalent proportions of thymoma patients and blood donor controls manifested indeterminate Western blots.",
            "In our study, p21 seroreactivity was weak and observed in only one thymoma patient (7%, in contrast to Manca et al) and four blood donors (20%).",
            "The limited-spectrum and mostly weak-intensity Western blot reactivity, coupled with the negative ELISA results, indicates that thymoma patients were infected with neither HTLV-I nor HTLV-II.",
            "Furthermore, there is little epidemiological evidence to relate thymoma to HTLV-I infection.",
            "HTLV-I is endemic in some areas of Japan, and interestingly, thymoma is more frequently diagnosed in the US among Asians/Pacific Islanders than in other racial groups.",
            "However, the excess of thymoma in the US is not limited to Japanese (National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, authors' unpublished analyses), and the heightened thymoma incidence in Asians/Pacific Islanders might be due to other genetic or environmental factors.",
            "We considered the possibility that we missed HTLV-I in thymoma because HTLV-I infection is uncommon in the US.",
            "Nonetheless, HTLV-I is equally rare in Italy, and none of the cases studied by had recognizable risk factors for acquiring HTLV-I.",
            "Foamy viruses infect many mammal species, but no foamy virus uniquely infecting humans has been identified.",
            "Based on extensive nucleotide and amino-acid homology, the foamy virus originally isolated from a human (ie, \u2018human foamy virus\u2019) may actually be identical to a chimpanzee simian foamy virus isolate (SFVcpz).",
            "Indeed, the African patient from whom HFV was first isolated could have acquired the virus from a primate, since such transmission of SFV can occur through close animal contact.",
            "Alternatively, the initial report may have represented a laboratory contamination.",
            "Two large serosurveys subsequently failed to find HFV infection in diverse human populations.",
            "In recognition of the likely identity of HFV with SFVcpz, some investigators refer to HFV as \u2018SFVcpz(hu)\u2019.",
            "Although evidence for infection with HFV (or a closely related primate virus) has been reported in patients with a range of autoimmune or idiopathic diseases, including Graves' disease, thyroiditis de Quervain, and multiple sclerosis, later studies cast doubts on those findings.",
            "Documented human infection with SFV has not been linked to disease.",
            "There are sparse data regarding a possible role for HFV in thymoma or myasthenia gravis.",
            "studied eight patients with myasthenia gravis, only one of whom (a female from Comoros) had HFV DNA sequences detected by PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",
            "On sequencing, part of the HFV bel1 gene was deleted, suggesting the presence of a replication-incompetent variant of the virus.",
            "Additionally, serum from the patient reacted to multiple HFV antigens by Western blot and immunofluorescence assays.",
            "reported amplifying HFV gag and bel2 sequences from thymus tissue of four Taiwanese patients with myasthenia gravis (two with \u2018lymphoepithelioma\u2019 variants of thymoma/thymic carcinoma, two with thymic hyperplasia).",
            "All four cases also had low-titer neutralising antibody against HFV.",
            "Attempts in both studies to isolate HFV were unsuccessful.",
            "Neither study provided an explanation for how these individuals might have become infected with a rare human or primate virus.",
            "Using primers designed to detect HFV sequences, we could not confirm these prior reports for US thymoma patients.",
            "With the same bel1 primer set used by, we ruled out the presence of HFV DNA at a level of one copy per 7500 cells in tumour tissue obtained from US patients with thymoma.",
            "With similar sensitivity, we excluded the presence of HFV gag sequences.",
            "Our gag primers should also have been able to amplify SFVcpz DNA, since the 3\u2032 primer (PR#2) perfectly matches the published SFVcpz gag sequence, while the 5\u2032 primer (NC#8) matches SFVcpz over its 3\u2032 end for 16 contiguous nucleotides.",
            "In conclusion, we did not find evidence for HTLV-I or HFV infection in US thymoma patients.",
            "It would be of further interest to study the relationship between HTLV-I, thymoma, and myasthenia gravis in geographic areas where HTLV-I is endemic.",
            "Since the cause of thymoma is unknown, further searches for a viral aetiology may be warranted."

            "Early in the use of the X-ray, it became evident that, on account of the repeated exposures, the operators were subject to grave danger.",
            "As is well known, they developed cancers from the burns in the skin and signs of damage to the blood-forming organs--anemia and leucopenia.",
            "These facts led both to experimental studies of the effects of X-rays and to an analysis of the changes in the blood cells (1-8).",
            "In connection with these early studies on the effects of X-rays, it is of great interest to note the work of Murphy.",
            "Following the suggestion of Webb et d. (9, 10) that lymphocytes are a measure of resistance in tuberculosis, Murphy and his collaborators (11-26) made extensive studies on the relation of this strain of cells to resistance both to tuberculosis and to cancer.",
            "They first found that lymphocytes could be stimulated or depressed by means of X-rays, and determined the appropriate dosage.",
            "Nakahara (22) showed that the stimulating effect on the lymph nodes from small doses of X-rays began as early as 48 hours, as shown in his figures (Fig. 2, Plate 8, and Fig. 4, Plate 9).",
            "With these data in hand, Murphy and Morton (15)  found that mice showing resistance to transplanted mouse cancer had a marked lymphocytosis and that this resistance could be broken down by doses of X-rays which produced no demonstrable changes except a necrosis of lymphoid tissues and the resulting lymphopenia.",
            "When the clinical use of radium became common, it was found again that the danger was to those handling this material in account of the repeated exposures and that the effects were the same as with the X-rays.",
            "Mottram eta/. (28) studied the Mood of two groups of workers: those who prepared and measured the emanations and those who gave the radium to the patients.",
            "They found a rapid fall in both granulocytes and in lymphocytes and discovered that these 267",
            "losses were regained only after a considerable interval.",
            "There were then several reports of the study of the blood after exposure to radium (29)(30)(31)(32)(33)(34)(35)(36)(37) and recently it has become clear that the anemia due to radium may be of the primary type (27,3843).",
            "The recent introduction of the use of luminous paint into industry, as well as the sale of radiated waters as tonics, has brought danger to another group of people from exposure to radioactive substances.",
            "In 1929, Martland (44) gave the history of the industrial hazard involved in the painting of dials.",
            "Starting in Switzerland, the industry was transferred to this country, and in 1922, 1923, and 1924 there were deaths of dial painters unrecognized as due to radioactive materials.",
            "In 1924, Blum reported a case of necrosis of the jaw in one of the dial painters.",
            "There followed a series of studies of the people exposed to radium (45)(46)(47)(48)(49)(50)(51)(52) in this industry.",
            "The early cases in this industrial group died of necrosis of the jaw; now, 8 years after the first reports, some of the cases have died with osteogenic sarcomata and some of those living have this condition, as determined by X-ray photographs.",
            "Flinn and his coworkers (49)(50)(51)(52) have made special studies of the methods of detecting the presence of radioactive material in the living subject and measuring its amount.",
            "They have measured the rate of excretion and have tested methods of increasing this rate and determined the degree of safety of their application.",
            "The development of osteogenic sarcomata in the human cases has increased the interest in the experimental production of tumors by radioactive substances.",
            "The first report of the production of osteogenic sarcomata in animals was published in 1910 by Marie el al. (53); they attempted to reproduce X-ray burns in animals to see if they would ultimately give rise to the same malignant reaction found in the X-ray operators.",
            "They exposed four rats to repeated small doses of X-rays for a period of several weeks.",
            "After 6 months one of them developed an ulcer which, 9 months later, suddenly became sarcomatous.",
            "The tumor showed active growth and invasion, but did not metastasize.",
            "In 1924, Bloch (54) reported the experimental production of epitheliomata of the ear in two rabbits by repeated exposure to X-rays.",
            "He succeeded in transplanting one of these tumors into another rabbit.",
            "The next year, Goebel and G~rard (55) reported the production of a neoplasm in one guinea pig out of twenty after repeated exposure to X-rays during 15 months.",
            "Daels and his coworkers (56)(57)(58) have made the most extensive studies of the experimental production of neopiasma with radioactive substances.",
            "They have produced sarcomata, some containing bone, and carcinomata of the bile ducts and the mammary glands.",
            "In all they have produced 10 sarcomata in 144 treated rats, 5 tumors in 80 treated mice, and 8 tumors in 191 treated guinea pigs.",
            "Of the 23 tumors, 19 followed the use of radioactive materials alone; the others developed after the use of a combination of radium and arsenious acid.",
            "One of the rat tumors was transplanted into 27 other rats; from 90 to 95 per cent transplants were successful and one tumor was in its tenth passage at the time of writing (1931).",
            "Maisin and Dupuis (59) obtained sarcomata of enormous size in cocks and hens by intravenous injections of ionium, in combination with injection into the pectoral muscles of embryonic extracts.",
            "With injections of embryonic extract alone, or with arsenious acid, they could not produce tumors.",
            "One of the tumors metastasized; they did not succeed in transplanting them.",
            "Schfirch and Uehlinger (60) implanted a needle containing 1 microgram of radium under the periosteum of the jaw-bone of a rabbit and allowed it to remain for 20 days.",
            "After 1\u00bd years an osteogenic sarcoma developed, limited to the periosteum; it was made up of osteoblasts, and contained newly formed masses of bone and many multinuclear giant cells.",
            "The literature considering the effects of radium on cancer cells in human cases will not be reviewed.",
            "It can be followed in the studies of Ewing (61), in the series of reviews published in the Archives de l'Institut du Radium ('Col. 1~ Paris, 1927, to date), and in the files of the Strahlentherapie (Berlin, 1912, to date).",
            "From the references here reported it is clear that radium has a destructive effect on the blood-forming organs; that the lymph nodes are more sensitive than the bone marrow; that there is a period of stimulation during which there is a relative increase in lymphocytes combined with a leucopenia; that the anemias tend to be of the primary type, associated with an increase in immature cells in the marrow; and lastly that radioactive substances produce malignant tumors, both sarcomata and carcinomata, some of which metastasize and can be transmitted in series.",

            "A complete absence of lymph cords, such as is shown in Fig. 3, gave to many of these nodes a cystic appearance at autopsy.",
            "In the figure it will be noted also that there was a marked reduction in the peripheral follicles.",
            "The mesenteric nodes in some instances were represented by tiny nodules, some of them containing follicles but others only lymphatic sinuses; these sinuses were identified by their endothelial cells which were loaded with the yellow pigment negative for iron, so characteristic a structure of the mesenteric nodes in rabbits.",

            "In Fig. 4, these cells are readily identified as the so called pale cells of the follicles, or the stem cell of the lymphocyte.",

            "The bone marrows were so mottled in appearance that the change is readily made out in sections with the unaided eye; this appearance is due to areas of apiasia alternating with zones which were either normal or in which there had been some shift toward the immature stages of the erythroid series.",
            "There was a change in the megalokaryocytes consisting in a large number of deeply basophilic nuclei almost completely denuded of cytoplasm; in one animal (1(157), 53 per cent of the megalokaryocytes were of this type.",
            "They may be considered as representing a shift toward immature stages of these cells.",
            "In almost every instance there was a marked change in the fat cells, consisting in a shrinkage due to the loss of fat from the cytoplasm.",

            "There were many vessels between bone and marrow.",
            "The right humerus showed more profound changes; this marrow was more markedly adherent to the bone, but was cut out and represented a calcified cast of the marrow cavity.",
            "It showed no blood formation, no supravital preparations could be made, and the mass was put aside for decalcification.",

            "The tumor, as shown in the left half of the photograph, was relatively uniform, made up predominantly of the sarcoma cells, but there were remnants of the sinusoids marked by perivascular clasmatocytes filled with iron-containing pigment; there were also a few myelocytes, some of them in division.",
            "The nuclei of tumor cells varied in size but not in type (Fig. 8); their chromatin was in fine particles along the linin framework; they had conspicuous basophilic nucleoli.",

            "8. The border of the tumor shown on the right side of Fig. 7, and at higher magnification in Fig. 9 showed the invasion of the tumor cells into the marrow.",
            "In this zone the marrow was hyperplastic due to a marked increase in neutrophilic leucocytes.",
            "This is clear in Fig. 9, where the characteristic tumor cells marked by arrows are shown between the marrow cells which are predominantly leucocytes.",
            "There was also a tumor in the left axilla, about 2\u00bd x 1 x 1 cm., which was made up of cells like those of the sarcoma of the marrow.",
            "In supravital preparations the cytoplasm showed no reaction to neutral red, as is characteristic of tumor ceils.",
            "The nudeoli were conspicuous.",
            "There were considerable numbers of multinucleated giant cells with nuclei of the same type.",
            "At one end there was a small necrotic area.",
            "There were three similar nodules in the lungs, two small ones in the left and a larger one in the right lung.",
            "Unfortunately these tissues were lost, but the supravital studies of the cells indicate quite clearly that there were metastases of the sarcoma.",
            "The study of the tissues of the next animal leads to the suggestion that the calcified marrow of the right side was an older stage of the tumor.",

            "In December the animal had a spontaneous fracture of the lower end of the right femur and was killed.",
            "Thus the experiment was the shortest of the series of seven which received the second series of injections.",
            "No anemia developed; the red ceils which had averaged 5,400,000 for the 1st month were 6 million the last month.",
            "The final fall in the white cells during November and December was due mainly to lymphocytes; in small part to basophils.",
            "During this period the loss in weight was 300 gin.",
            "Almost the entire marrow cavity above the fracture was occupied by a tumor.",

            "The contours of the tumor were sharp, as is shown in Fig. 11.",
            "At the upper end of the tumor there was a zone of aplasia (Fig. 11), beyond which there was a remnant of normal bone marrow.",
            "The fracture of the bone was opposite the lower end of the tumor.",
            "The sarcomatous nature of the new growth is clear in Fig. 11, The type of cell is shown in Fig. 12; the nuclei are of the same type as in the tumor of R 117.",
            "In many places there were small masses of newly formed bone in the tumor, some of them in small placques, such as the one shown opposite Arrow A in Fig. 12, others in irregular networks.",
            "Near these small masses of bone were giant cells, such as the one marked by Arrow B, Fig. 12, which is of the type of the osteoclast.",
            "The nuclei in these giant cells were like those of the tumor cells, which is in agreement with the theory of Arey (66) that the osteoclast is formed by the fusion of osteoblasts.",
            "That the tumor itself was derived from osteoblasts is indicated in Fig. 13, which is a small mass of bone against the tumor; it is denuded of osteoblasts, but three typical tumor cells nearby probably represent them.",
            "Fig. 14 is a small piece of damaged bone near the fracture.",
            "It was cut without decalcification; the bone corpuscles are shown with their processes entirely free from the canaliculi of the bone and in the upper part of the section the mineral matter of the bone is shown much fragmented.",
            "The bone marrow in this animal does not appear mottled with the development of the aplastic zones seen in other animals.",
            "The cells, however, are difficult to discriminate because of a damage to the nuclei which makes them all look alike.",
            "Mottram (67) has seen the same change in the bone marrow of rats exposed to the gamma radiation from radium.",
            "The fat cells and the matrix were normal.",
            "A count of marrow cells with the supravital technique showed an increase in the RADIUM CHLORIDE AND MESOTHORIIY/~ INJECTIONS proportion of erythroid elements, 1,023 erythroid to 990 myeloid.",
            "Of the erythroid cells, there was an increased proportion of the early erythroblasts (18 per cent), with late erythroblasts 29 per cent and normoblasts 52 per cent.",
            "The early erythroblasts were described as very large cells which were entirely typical.",
            "31 per cent of the megalokaryocytes were of the type already described, represented by deeply staining nuclei, apparently denuded of cytoplasm.",
            "Some of the less darkly stained nuclei showed marked signs of damage to the chromatin.",
            "All of the lymphoid tissues including the follicles of the spleen, the mesenteric, and the peripheral nodes were small but in sections were hyperplastic, owing to the same marked stimulation of the primitive cells seen in Rabbit R 210.",
            "None of these ceils, however, were in division, and both in the spleen and in the lymph nodes there were large masses of them, showing a peculiar type of necrosis.",
            "This process involved only the pale stem cells.",
            "The reaction is illustrated in Fig. 6; in the photograph the nuclei are so pale that they are difficult to differentiate and in the section stained with hematoxylin and eosin the entire area had a slate blue color.",
            "The cells look as if there had been a complete solution and diffusion into the tissues of the stainable matter of the nuclei.",
            "This is the only animal in which such extensive necrosis of lymphoid tissues was found.",
            "In the mesenteric nodes there were large areas covering several low power fields showing this necrosis; some of the small peripheral nodes were completely involved and the entire thymus showed the reaction.",
            "Besides this reaction in the lymphoid tissues, there was a similar extensive damage to the liver cells.",
            "Most of the cells of this organ showed the same slate blue color of the cytoplasm with signs of damage to the chromatin of the nuclei; but the nuclei were much less depleted of chromatin than those of the primitive ceils of the lymphoid tissues.",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "In this series of experiments a number of phenomena have been observed: marked changes in the lymphoid tissues eventually registered by a lymphopenia; a slight anemia associated with a destruction of red blood cells and, within the limits of this experiment, with only minimal changes in the bone marrow; atrophy of the thymus; a damage to the liver ceils and a reduction in size of this organ; the frequent development of abscesses; one spontaneous fracture; and in two instances the development of osteogenic sarcomata.",
            "Throughout this discussion it is to be borne in mind that the number of animals used was small.",
            "All studies on the biological effects of radioactive substances show that the dose is an important factor; as shown in the literature, depending on the dose, the effects have ranged from conditions in which only lymphoid tissues have been altered (44) to death in a short time (1).",
            "In these experiments the dose of mesothorium was higher than of radium chloride in the proportion of 7.7 to 5.1 which in terms of alpha particles means a ratio of 38 to 20.",
            "In considering the biological effect of radium it is necessary to know the amount stored in the tissues, since a considerable amount of the radium given is excreted (49).",
            "Methods for measuring radioactive materials in the living person have been developed by Flinn et al. (49)(50)(51)(52).",
            "Effects on Lymph Nodes and Lymphocytes",
            "The effects on the lymph nodes in our series can be followed in Figs.",
            "1 to 6, and they are to be compared with the changes in the lymphocytes shown in Graph 2.",
            "In general it will be noted that the lymphocytes fell faster after mesothorium than after radium chloride.",
            "After three injections of 5.1 micrograms of radium chloride (R 210), only the peripheral lymph nodes were affected, indicating that they are more sensitive to radioactive materials than the mesenteric nodes and spleen.",
            "They showed a uniform hyperplasia of the primitive stem cells (Fig. 1) with extremely active cell division.",
            "By the end of 11 months after six injections of 7.7 micrograms of mesothorium (R 211) all of the lymphoid tissues were involved.",
            "The animal still showed the increase in the primitive cells, but, in contrast to the previous experiment, there was no cell division.",
            "Instead, large areas of the primitive cells showed a peculiar type of degeneration in which the changes that could be detected were in the chromatin of the nuclei (Fig. 6).",
            "The sections look as if the chromatin had dissolved and diffused through the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm.",
            "The same type of cellular damage involved all of the cells of the thymus.",
            "This was the only animal in which we found damage to the stem cells in the stage of their hyperplasia; in the other animals a similar damage was seen to the stem cells scattered in their normal proportions in the follicles.",
            "This difference will be clear by comparing Figs. 2 and4.",
            "The six remaining animals were allowed to live from 14 to 19 months after the first injection.",
            "The study of their tissues shows that after the period of stimulation to the primitive stem cell, there was a marked development of immature lymphocytes, the type of cells with deeply basophilic cytoplasm, known as the lymphoblast.",
            "In the follicles 7,000 5,000 ~,ooo  this was shown by a marked increase in the proportion of the large lymphoblasts to the mature small lymphocytes as seen in Fig. 5, while in many of the lymph cords there was a complete replacement of mature lymphocytes by lymphoblasts.",
            "This condition was both accompanied and followed by signs of damage to the stem cell of the lymphocytes, illustrated by the cells with arrows in Figs.",
            "4 and6.",
            "This damage was a shrinkage of the nuclei, as can be seen by comparing with the corresponding normal nuclei in Fig. 2, and with a gradual depletion of the chromatin until nothing stainable was left in the nuclei but an inner rim to the nuclear membrane.",
            "No such signs of damage could be made out either in the lymphoblasts or in the mature lymphocytes.",
            "The next stage in the changes of the lymph nodes was depletion, starting with the cells of the lymph cords and gradually involving the follicles as well.",
            "The contrast between the period of atrophy and the early stimulation is shown in Figs.",
            "1 and3.",
            "A node in which all of the lymph cords had disappeared looked cystic in the gross specimen; the process went on to the complete atrophy of some nodes.",
            "These processes were not all in the same stage in the different nodes of an animal.",
            "For example, in R 133 the follicles of the spleen showed a hyperplasia of the stem cell while the lymph nodes showed atrophy.",
            "In general the depletion was more extreme in the peripheral nodes than in the mesenteric nodes and in the spleen; in some instances the peripheral nodes had disappeared entirely.",
            "The effects on the lymphoid tissues may thus be summed up in three stages: first, a period of stimulation to the stem cell; second, a shift to the immature stage known as the lymphoblast; and third, a depletion of the nodes due to such a damage of the stem cell that the losses in lymphocytes could no longer be made up.",
            "With these processes in mind it is interesting to follow the changes in the lymphocytes in the blood.",
            "The blood cells of the animal which developed the abscess and was killed after three injections are shown in Graph 1.",
            "We do not know the reason for the rise of all of the strains of white blood cells, unaccompanied by a rise in red cells, which is shown for April 21; the curve of the red cells indicated that it was not a process of dehydration.",
            "However, the subsequent curve of the lymphocytes shows that there was no sustained rise in circulating lymphocytes in this animal to reflect the hyperplasia of the primitive stem cells shown in Fig.",

            "In Graph 2 it will be seen that during the initial 5 months in which the primitive cells of the lymph nodes were stimulated, three animals show a rise in lymphocytes, three a fall, and one no change.",
            "Thus there was no constant early reaction of the ]ymphocytes in the blood which may have been due to variations in the condition of the different lymph nodes.",
            "All of the graphs show a rise in lymphocytes during the summer months.",
            "There are two factors to be considered in relation to the rise in lymphocytes in summer; for July and August the differential counts were made on fixed films and it is our experience that lymphocytes run on an average 4 per cent higher in counts made with fixed films than in counts of the living cells (68).",
            "In every instance, the first counts of lymphocytes, taken before the second series of injections was started, were lower than the counts in August.",
            "These points make the rise during the summer months of less significance as an effect of the injections of radioactive material.",
            "Every graph shows that there was a final, significant, and steady fall in lymphocytes covering in general the period of the second series of injections.",
            "The study of the tissues for each animal has shown that the lymph nodes finally exhibited a marked shift to the lymphoblast and a depletion of the nodes due to a failure of the stem cells to replace lymphocytes.",
            "The final period of the more precipitous fall in lymphocytes, covering the 3 or 4 months before each animal was killed, has been in each instance correlated with a loss in weight in the animals.",
            "They all showed a gain in weight during the early months of the experiment, probably due to the better feeding of the animals which were all bought from dealers and not bred in the laboratory.",
            "Four were females and of them three gave birth to young during the experiment.",
            "The loss in weight which is associated with the period of depletion of the lymph nodes is of great significance in connection with the studies of the relation of lymphocytes to resistance to cancer and to tuberculosis (9-26, 69, 70).",
            "Thomas (71) has found in a study of a series of tuberculous rabbits that in the final period of broken resistance there is a loss in weight which is proportional to the fall in lymphocytes.",
            "This series of radiated animals demonstrates the same phenomenon,-an atrophy of the lymph nodes, a lymphopenia, and at the same time a loss in weight.",
            "This correlation was constant and significant.",
            "Effects on the Bone Marrow and the Red Cells",
            "There were no changes in the neutrophilic leucocytes in this series other than those associated with the development of the abscesses.",
            "There were also no changes in eosinophilic leucocytes and in monocytes, but in every instance there was a fall in basophils during the period of the final fall in lymphocytes.",
            "The fact that the bone marrow as a hematopoietic organ is less sensitive than the lymph nodes is shown not only by the lack of change in granulocytes but also by the slight changes in the red cells.",
            "This will be clear by comparing the graphs of the red cells (Graph 3) with those of the lymphocytes in Graph 2.",
            "There was no change whatever in the color index throughout the experiments, even in R 171, at the time of the precipitous fall in red cells.",
            "Rabbit R 211, which was killed in 11 months, showed no anemia whatever; the original count of red cells was 5,200,000 and the final count was 6,000,000.",
            "It will be noted on Graph 3 that all of the animals except the first two showed a slight fall in red blood cells by March or April, but all except R 171 showed an excellent recovery to the level of 6,000,000 cells by August or the early months of the fall.",
            "All of the animals which received the extra injection in January showed then a progressive fall in red cells.",
            "The graph of R 171 shows that this animal was a special case in regard to the red blood cells; the original level of the red cells in this animal was lower than in the others and, from July on, there was a slight loss of red cells which became extreme after the extra injection in January.",
            "All of the figures on this chart are averages except the records shown for February for R 171, in which the 4 counts for the first half of the month are plotted separately in order to bring out better the rapidity and severity of the fall in red cells from 4,380,000 to 1,800,000.",
            "In the preceding months the counts of the red cells did not vary much from the average.",
            "The signs were of a peripheral destruction of red cells: marked fragmentation of these cells, as seen in the supravital preparations, and the extreme increase in iron-containing pigment in spleen and bone marrow seen in sections.",
            "However, the bone marrow also showed greater damage than any of the other animals in the series, for it not only revealed the change in the fat cells and the marked mottling of active areas and zones of complete aplasia, but in the active areas there were some large zones of immature erythroblastic cells comparable to the great increase in lymphoblasts described in the lymph nodes.",
            "This is interesting in connection with the reports of the occurrence of a primary anemia due to exposure to radioactive substances in human cases (27,(38)(39)(40)(41)(42)(43).",
            "All of the other animals in the series, except the three that were killed too early (R 134, R 210, and R 211), showed changes in the fat cells and the mottling of the marrow but not the shift to early erythroblastic or megaloblastic marrow.",
            "The mottling of the marrow is due to a change in the normal distribution of active and inactive marrow; in the normal rabbit there are large areas, often at the periphery, of active marrow and smaller, centrally placed, inactive zones.",
            "The mottling is a change in this pattern.",
            "It is easily seen with the unaided eye and may indicate a local damage to the stem cells of the marrow, due to an uneven distribution of the radioactive material in the bone.",
            "The great reserve in the tissues of the marrow may account for the fact that so much change in the marrow was not reflected to a greater extent in the blood.",
            "From the results on Graph 3, it is likely that the first series of injections of the radioactive material caused enough peripheral destruction of the red cells to give rise to a slight anemia but that there was not enough damage to the bone marrow to be detected in the blood (R 211).",
            "With the second series, however, the crowding of the two injections into the 1 month caused not only an increased peripheral destruction but also instigated changes in the bone marrow which were progressive.",
            "In one animal in the series (R 171) both the red cells and the bone marrow were more susceptible to radioactive material than in the other animals, and in this instance there occurred both extreme destruction of mature red cells and the early signs of the changes in the marrow of the increased proportion of immature cells of the erythroid series which eventually results in an anemia of the primary type.",
            "Thus, the effects on the red cells were similar in type but less in degree than those on the lymph nodes.",
            "They are, increased destruction of red cells, a shift to the immature phases in the marrow, and finally aplasia.",
            "Effects on Thymus and Liver",
            "The observations on the thymus in our series are meager, but they suggest that the cells of the thymus (R 211) are affected in the same manner as the primitive stem cells of the lymph nodes and that they are not as resistant to radioactive material as mature lymphocytes.",
            "The end-result of this effect is a complete atrophy of the organ.",
            "A damage to the liver has been noted in four animals; with mesothorium (three animals) there were changes in the nuclei, similar in kind but less in amount than those of the stem cell of the lymph nodes; namely, a loss of chromatin from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.",
            "The damage was reflected in a marked reduction in the size of this organ.",
            "Both of the animals which showed paralysis--one of them certainly without damage of the central nervous system--exhibited the reduction in size of the liver.",
            "These symptoms are possibly explained by the demonstration by Mann (72) of weakness and paralysis in dogs after removal of the liver and of the same phenomena in rabbits after partial liver insufficiency by McMaster and Drury (73,74) and after total removal of the liver by Drury (75).",
            "Production of Osteogenic Sarcomata through Storage of Radioactive Material in the Bones",
            "Certain results in our series of animals are interesting in relation to the industrial hazard in the use of radioactive materials: first, the number of abscesses that developed; second, the spontaneous fracture; and third, the development of osteogenic sarcomata in two animals.",
            "Our percentage of tumor formation, two out of seven animals, was high in comparison with the figures of Daels et al.",
            "It has been demonstrated that the bones store the radioactive material.",
            "The sarcomata were dearly derived from osteoblasts; in one instance there was newly formed bone associated with giant cells of the type of the osteoclast.",
            "In one case there were metastases.",
            "We have lacked one element in the proof of malignancy; namely, successful transplantation of the tumors.",
            "No attempts in this direction were made.",
            "SUMMARY",
            "The observations in this work suggest that with certain doses of radioactive material, the fundamental damage in the lymphoid tissues is to the stem cell and that the damage is to the chromatin of the nuclei of these cells.",
            "The erythroid tissues are apparently less susceptible to radioactive material than the lymphoid tissues but an original anemia of secondary type from peripheral destruction may eventually be changed to one of primary type through decreased maturation of primitive cells in the marrow.",
            "The damage of lymph nodes and bone marrow leads to atrophy of these organs.",
            "The cells of the liver and thymus suffer nuclear damage of the same general character as is seen in the lymph nodes, and there is an atrophy of these organs.",
            "The storage of the radioactive material in the bones gave rise to osteogenic sarcomata in two out of seven rabbits surviving from 11 to 19 months.",

            "Although the effect of betel, with or without tobacco, on oesophageal cancer risk has been studied in India (Jussawalla, 1981;Nandakumar et al, 1996), this has not been done in Taiwan, where areca, or betel, is most often chewed with lime and piper betle influorescence (Chen et al, 1999).",
            "Because betel quid is not chewed with tobacco in Taiwan, it is possible to investigate the independent risks of betel, and cigarette tobacco and alcohol, on developing oesophageal cancer.",

            "Cases were histologically confirmed oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma from the Department of Chest Surgery at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan.",
            "The Department of Preventive Medicine at this hospital chose 1 to 3 control subjects without malignancy matched on period of hospitalization age (\u00b1 3 y) and gender.",
            "In total, 104 cases (94 males and 10 females) and 277 controls (256 males and 21 females) were recruited for interview between July, 1996 andOctober 2000.",
            "Subjects were interviewed by a trained interviewer using a standardized questionnaire.",
            "Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.",
            "Information on habitual substance use included whether the subject had ever been a habitual betel chewer, cigarette smoker, or alcoholic beverage drinker, what year the subject started and quit, the duration of consumption, the daily amount consumed, and type of alcoholic beverage consumed.",
            "Subjects who reported smoking more than 10 cigarettes per week for at least 6 months were defined as cigarette smokers, those who reported regularly chewing betel quid for at least 6 months were defined as betel chewers, and those who reported drinking beer, wine or distilled spirits more than once a week for at least 6 months were defined as alcoholic beverage drinkers.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "Lifetime consumption of tobacco was calculated by multiplying the number of packs per day by the number of years smoked, giving pack-years.",
            "Lifetime consumption of betel quid was calculated as betel years by multiplying the average number of betel quid per day by the number of years chewed.",
            "Lifetime consumption of alcoholic beverage was calculated as gram years by multiplying the concentration of alcohol in the consumed beverage by the amount consumed per day by the number of years consumed.",
            "The generalized additive model was used to adjust for other confounding factors without imposing a rigid parametric assumption about their dependence on risk, as in a previous study (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990).",
            "Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the association between case/control status and chewing betel nut and use of other substances.",
            "For substance use, we used no cigarette smoking, no betel chewing, or no alcohol consumption (each as defined above) as baselines and compared these baselines to lifetime consumption of the 3 substances and categorized the use into 2 groups based on the median.",
            "In addition, the synergistic or combined effect of these substances was also examined for significance.",
            "The data were analysed using the SAS and S-plus statistical packages (SAS, 1988;Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990).",
            "RESULTS",
            "There were 271 pathology-proven cases of oesophageal squamouscell carcinoma at National Taiwan University Hospital between July, 1996 andOctober, 2000. 46% (77/167) of the non-recruited patients were found to have distant metastasis in this study, whereas only 20% (21/104) of the recruited patients were found to have distant metastasis, a significant difference (P < 0.001).",
            "The mean age range of the 104 oesophageal cancer patients and 277 controls were 39-84 (mean 60.6) and 38-81 (mean 62.6) years, respectively.",
            "Table 1 shows the odds ratios for the combined effect of these substances on oesophageal cancer after adjusting for other covariates.",
            "It was found that the higher the number of substances used concurrently, the higher the risk for oesophageal cancer.",
            "Compared to those who abstained from these substances, subjects who consumed 1, 2 and 3 substances concurrently had 1.8-, 12.3-and 63.9-fold risk of oesophageal cancer, respectively (95% CI = 0.8-4.2, 5.6-27.2 and 23.7-171.9) after adjusting for age and gender.",
            "The findings remained similar after further adjustment for educational levels, tea consumption and intake of green vegetables.",
            "However, we did not find any significant interaction or joint effect between any 2 of these 3 substances (data not shown).",
            "The smoothing plots of age and lifetime consumption of the substances after adjusting for educational levels, tea consumption, and intake of green vegetables are presented in Figure 1.",
            "Because the risk of contracting oesophageal cancer increases after about age 65 years, the patients were categorized as 65 years or younger and over 65 years for subsequent analysis, the risk of developing oesophageal cancer in the latter group increasing markedly.",
            "The relationship between lifetime consumption of all 3 substances and oesophageal cancer risk also increased sharply.",
            "Although there were instances of higher dose users showing a small decline in risk, the observations were relatively few and insignificant.",
            "For example, only 8 and 7 observations in the groups of heavy smokers and heavy chewers had a relatively low risk for oesophageal cancer, but they still had a higher risk than those who did not smoke or chew (Figure 1).",
            "We also examined the effect of lifetime consumption of the substances on oesophageal cancer risk.",
            "The median cut-off points for lifetime consumption of these substance were 30 pack-year for cigarette smokers, 495 betel-year for areca chewers, and 1220 gram-year for alcoholic beverage drinkers.",
            "The group that chewed 495 betel-year chewed an average of about 20 betel quid per day for 20 consecutive years.",
            "The group that consumed 1220 gramyear consumed an average of four 300-350 c.c. cans of beer (5% alcohol) per day for 20 consecutive years.",
            "In the final regression model, we found that education levels and substance use, including cigarette smoking, betel chewing, and alcohol consumption, were significant risk factors of oesophageal cancer (Table 2).",
            "After adjusting for other covariates, subjects who consumed 1-495 betel-year and more than 495 betel-years (about 20 betel quid per day for 20 years) were found to have a 3.6-fold (95% CI = 1.3-10.1) and a 9.2-fold (CI 1.8-46.7) risk, respectively, of developing oesophageal cancer, compared to those who did not.",
            "For cigarette smoking, subjects who smoked more than 30 pack-year had a 3.2-fold risk (95% CI = 1.5-6.8), compared to those who did not smoke.",
            "Compared to those who did not drink, subjects who",
            "consumed more than 1220 gram-year of alcohol (about 4 cans of beer per day for 20 years) in a lifetime had a 9.7-fold risk for oesophageal cancer (95% CI = 4.3-22.0).",
            "After further adjusting for age, gender, tea consumption and intake of green vegetables, these findings remained the same (Table 2).",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "Besides cigarette smoking and alcoholic beverage consumption, betel chewing was found to be a major independent risk factor for oesophageal cancer, the more betel consumed during a lifetime, the higher the risk.",
            "Previous studies have found that chewing 'pan' (without tobacco), which consists betel leaf, betel nut and slaked lime, was a significant risk factor for oesophageal cancer in India (Jussawalla, 1981;Nandakumar et al, 1996).",
            "Our study confirmed this association in Taiwan, although the content of betel quid in India is a little different from that in Taiwan (Chen et al, 1999).",
            "Since most of the cases in this study were to evaluate possible surgery, it is likely that a smaller proportion of our cases had metastases than the non-recruited cases.",
            "In Taiwan, piper betle influorescence, which contains about 15 mg g -1 safrole is frequently added to betel quid (Chen et al, 1999;Liu et al, 2000).",
            "During chewing, the concentration of safrole can reach 420 \u00b5M.",
            "Animal experiments have found that DNA adducts can be formed in the livers of mice by 1\u2032-hydroxysafrole, a metabolite of safrole (Borchert et al, 1973;Ioannides et al, 1981;Randerath et al, 1984;Reddy and Randerath, 1990).",
            "In addition, Ramchandani and his co-workers (1998) found that administration of 25 mg pan masala extract, a dry powder mixture of areca nut, catechu, lime, and some unspecific spices and flavouring agents, to diethylnitrosamine-initiated ICRC mice significantly enhanced the growth of oesophagus papilloma.",

            "The prevalence of betel chewing in the Taiwanese population is over 10% (Ko et al, 1992).",
            "One study reporting an association between betel chewing and oral cancer (Ko et al, 1995) found that subjects who swallowed betel juice were at a significantly higher risk than those who did not.",
            "These workers therefore stressed the importance of examining the effect of betel chewing on cancer of the pharynx, larynx, oesophagus and stomach.",
            "Although we demonstrated that chewing betel quid can cause oesophageal cancer, we did not collect information on whether betel juice was swallowed.",

            "We found a combined effect of consuming cigarettes, areca, and alcohol on oesophagus cancer risk, but not a significant joint or synergistic effect caused by any two of the substances: this might be due to our small sample size.",
            "In conclusion, in addition to cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, areca chewing is an independent potent risk factor for oesophagus cancer in Taiwan and also a combined effect of these 3 substances.",

            "Introduction",
            "Glycine is a nonessential amino acid that can be converted directly from serine in mammalian cells.",
            "Serine is derived from 3-phosphoglycerate.",
            "Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) reversibly catalyzes the conversion of serine to glycine and vice versa.",
            "In the liver of vertebrates, glycine can be synthesized from N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate by glycine synthase.",
            "Glycine is the precursor material for biosynthesis of protein, purine, and glutathione.",
            "In addition, glycine is converted into sarcosine (N-methylglycine) by glycine N-methyltransferase, and reversely, sarcosine can be converted into glycine by sarcosine dehydrogenase.",
            "The serum half-life of intravenously administered glycine varies from 1/2 hour to 4 hours.",
            "Recently, the importance of glycine in cancer cell biology has been revealed.",
            "In a human melanoma LOX IMVI cell line, about two-thirds of intracellular glycine is synthesized intracellularly, while one-third of intracellular glycine is taken from extracellular glycine sources.",
            "In a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines that the National Cancer Institute uses for anticancer drug screening, rapidly proliferating cancer cells consumed extracellular glycine due to increased demand for glycine.",
            "In contrast, rapidly proliferating human normal cell lines released glycine.",
            "These findings suggest that targeting glycine consumption may become a new strategy in killing rapidly proliferating cancer cells, while not harming rapidly proliferating normal cells.",
            "Indeed, the use of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knockdown expression of SHMT2, thus blocking endogenous glycine synthesis, effectively halted proliferation of LOX IMVI cells in the absence of extracellular glycine.",
            "In contrast, slowly proliferating cells were not affected by SHMT2 knockdown and deprivation of extracellular glycine.",
            "There are two isozymes of SHMT.",
            "SHMT1 encodes for the cytoplasmic and SHMT2 encodes for the mitochondrial isozyme.",
            "In mammalian cells, SHMT2 gene has an alternative promoter within intron 1, thus SHMT2 encodes for two transcripts, SHMT2 and SHMT2\u03b1.",
            "SHMT2 protein containing exon 1 (with mitochondrial-targeting sequence) is localized in mitochondria.",
            "SHMT2\u03b1 protein without exon 1 is not imported into mitochondria efficiently and is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and nucleus.",
            "SHMT1 protein, like SHMT2\u03b1, is also localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and both SHMT1 and SHMT2\u03b1 catalyze production of one-carbon units from serine for nuclear de novo thymidylate biosynthesis.",
            "Interestingly, a glycine analog, aminomethylphosphonate (aminomethylphosphonic acid [AMPA]) (molecular formula CH6NO3P [Figure 1]), inhibits more than 95% of nuclear thymidylate biosynthesis that requires SHMT1 and SHMT2\u03b1, suggesting that AMPA is an effective inhibitor of SHMT1 and SHMT2\u03b1, as well as SHMT2.",
            "AMPA is the primary degradation product of glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine; molecular formula C3H3NO5P [Figure 1]).",
            "Glyphosate is water soluble and chemically stable and is degraded by microbes to produce AMPA.",
            "Glyphosate is a weak organic acid consisting of a glycine moiety and a phosphonomethyl moiety.",
            "Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum herbicide that is used worldwide in agriculture, forestry, and aquatic weed control.",
            "It is applied to many crops in various commercial formulations.",

            "In animal studies using [C]glyphosate in rats, rabbits, and goats, approximately 30% of the oral dose was absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.",
            "On day 7 after the oral dose of [C]glyphosate in rats, the isotope was distributed throughout the animal body, with the highest concentration found in the bones.",
            "Almost all of the isotope was eliminated in urine and feces, with a very low level exhaled in air.",
            "The only metabolite was AMPA, which accounted for about 0.2% to 0.3% of the administered dose of glyphosate.",
            "In a study in rats, approximately 20% of the oral dose of AMPA was absorbed, which was excreted almost exclusively through the urine, with less than 0.1% of the dose expired as CO2.",
            "Glyphosate and AMPA have been found to present no significant toxicity in acute, subchronic, and chronic animal studies, nor any genotoxicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.",
            "In this study, we assessed the effects of glyphosate and AMPA on cancer cell growth.",

            "Previously, it was shown that cancer cell proliferation was impaired by knocking down the expression levels of SHMT2 that is responsible for intracellular glycine synthesis.",
            "Here we present data showing that glycine analogs, glyphosate and AMPA, inhibited cell growth in eight cancer cell lines, including four human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2B, DU-145, and PC-3), two human ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3), one human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), and one human lung cancer cell line (A549).",
            "In contrast, glyphosate and AMPA did not impair the growth of two immortalized human normal prostatic epithelial cell lines (RWPE-1 and pRNS-1-1) at concentrations up to 50 mM.",
            "These findings suggest that glyphosate and AMPA can differentially affect cancer cell growth but not normal cell growth at concentrations up to 50 mM.",
            "However, at a higher concentration of 100 mM, AMPA decreased cell viability of the two normal cell lines, suggesting that potential adverse side effects may arise when the doses are too high.",
            "A safe therapeutic window may be limited to a drug concentration of between 50 mM to 100 mM.",
            "However, in clinical practice, it may be difficult to administer the drugs to reach this high concentration.",
            "Therefore, the use of glyphosate and AMPA in patients may be limited if the high IC50 concentrations are difficult to achieve in patients\u2019 blood.",
            "Nevertheless, glyphosate, particularly AMPA, may be a good lead compound for developing more potent inhibitors with low IC50 concentrations.",
            "Among the human cancer cell lines, the castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines (C4-2B, DU-145, and PC-3) and ovarian cancer cell line (OVCAR-3) appear to be more sensitive to glyphosate and AMPA than are the other human cancer cell lines.",
            "The IC50 concentrations varied from 34.2 to 68.1 mM among the four sensitive cancer cell lines (C4-2B, DU-145, PC-3, and OVCAR-3).",
            "In contrast, the IC50 concentrations were between 89 and 136.7 mM in other cancer cell lines, including LNCaP, SKOV-3, HeLa, and A549 (Table 1), suggesting that these four cell lines are resistant to glyphosate and AMPA.",
            "The differences in sensitivity may be caused by many factors that are not clearly understood because these cell lines are derived from different genetic backgrounds.",
            "The rate of cell proliferation may be one of the factors, as suggested by previous study.",
            "Indeed, the C4-2B cells were more sensitive to glyphosate and AMPA than LNCaP cells.",
            "Coincidentally, LNCaP cells grow slower than C4-2B cells, which are castration-resistant cells derived from the hormone-sensitive LNCaP cells.",
            "This observation indicates that glyphosate and AMPA are more effective in inhibiting growth of rapidly proliferating cancer cells.",
            "Cell growth in a population of cells represents the net outcome of proliferation and apoptosis.",
            "Our data indicate that AMPA can arrest cancer cells in the G1/G0 phase of cell cycle, thus inhibiting entry into the S phase.",
            "On the other hand, AMPA can enhance apoptosis of cancer cells, as shown by the increased rates of annexin-V-positive cells and increased levels of cleaved PARP, an indicator of apoptosis.",
            "Therefore, AMPA inhibits cancer cell growth through inhibition of cellular proliferation and promotion of apoptosis.",
            "The molecular mechanism may be that AMPA upregulates the p53 protein level, which subsequently increases p21 protein level.",
            "Activation of the p53-p21 pathway is known to cause G1-phase arrest and apoptosis in mammalian cells.",
            "AMPA downregulates the expression of cyclin D3, which may also contribute to the cell cycle arrest.",
            "AMPA increases procaspase 9 levels and simultaneously decreases procaspase 3 levels, which may mediate apoptosis, as shown in a previous study.",
            "However, how AMPA initiates these molecular changes and whether these changes apply to other cancer cell lines remain to be determined.",
            "To our best knowledge, this is the first study showing that glycine analogs can inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of cancer cells but not normal cells, in vitro at concentrations up to 50 mM.",
            "Higher concentrations of the chemicals may affect normal cells, thus producing adverse side effects.",
            "These findings suggest that animal studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of glyphosate and AMPA in the treatment of tumors growing in animals and to test whether the effective inhibitory concentrations can be achieved in animal blood.",
            "If a positive outcome is obtained in preclinical animal study, it will be feasible to conduct human clinical trials because glyphosate and AMPA are of little toxicity to animals and humans.",
            "On the other hand, more potent inhibitors may be developed using glyphosate and AMPA as lead compounds.",

            "The daily intake of DMF (0.012 \u03bcg/capita/day) and FFA (180 \u03bcg/capita/day) from flavorings is considered by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to be underestimated.",
            "Approval for use of DMF as a flavoring was on hold due to toxicological concerns over suspected reactivity towards DNA, but was in 2015 no longer supported as a flavoring substance by industry.",
            "The estimated intake of FFA is low enough to justify approval of FFA as a flavoring, but these estimates are rough estimates based on production volumes and do not include the much higher FFA levels formed during food processing.",

            "In the V79 cell line, DMF concentrations of 1.0, 1.5 and 2mM resulted in a significant 8-fold (P = 0.006), 9-fold (P = 0.002) and 12-fold (P < 0.001) increase in DNA damage compared to the unexposed cells, respectively.",
            "Likewise, the transfected V79 cells exposed to the same concentrations of DMF had a significantly 5-fold (P =0 .024), 6-fold (P = 0.013) and 6-fold (P = 0.011) higher amount of DNA damage than the unexposed cells.",

            "Cell viability remained high (>80%) at all the tested concentrations of FFA, except for V79-hCYP2E1-hSULT1A1 cells following exposure to 15mM of FFA which gave a live cell count of 64% (Figure 2; Supplementary Table 1).",
            "Western Blot",
            "The presence of transfected human CYP2E1 and SULT1A1 proteins in V79-hCYP2E1-hSULT1A1 cells was verified by Western blotting (Figure 3).",
            "Strong proteins bands corresponding to hCYP2E1 (54.2kDa) and hSULT1A1 (32.5kDa) were detected for the V79-hCYP2E1-hSULT1A1 cell samples, but not in those from the parental V79 cells (Figure 3).",
            "Discussion",
            "FFA is able to induce gene mutations in bacteria upon activation by SULTs.",
            "This mutagenicity is mediated by benzylic DNA adducts at the exocyclic amino group of purine bases.",
            "The formation of these adducts has also been detected in mouse models and even in lung tissue in humans in vivo.",
            "Disruption of the Sult1a1 gene in mice led to a drastic decrease in the formation of these DNA adducts in mouse tissues, whereas transgenic human SULT1A1 enhanced the adduct formation in mouse models.",
            "Therefore, we performed the SCGE assay with FFA not only in control V79 cells, which are SULT-deficient, but also in a line engineered for expression of human SULT1A1.",
            "Somewhat surprisingly, FFA induced minimal DNA damage, as detected in the SCGE assay, only at the highest concentration used (15mM), which was considered too high to be biologically relevant.",
            "Even at this concentration the effect was weak.",
            "It is likely that alkaline SCGE assay may not be able to detect the type of damage induced by FFA, since adducts formed by FFA are shown to be bypassed by DNA polymerase and thereby will not necessarily lead to DNA strand brakes detected by the Comet assay.",
            "DMF is not chemically reactive as such.",
            "To the best of our knowledge, no metabolism studies have been conducted with this compound.",
            "However, the structural similarities with furan and FFA could indicate potential activation pathways.",
            "Furan is oxidatively metabolized, under ring-opening, to cis-2-butene-1,4-dial, which is highly reactive.",
            "This reaction can be catalyzed by CYPs, in particular CYP2E1.",
            "A homologous reaction with DMF would yield cis-3-hexene-2,5-dione.",
            "Such \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated bis-ketones are markedly less reactive than \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated bis-aldehydes.",
            "However, DMF, unlike furan, additionally contains two methyl group.",
            "Such benzylic positions are preferred sites for oxidative metabolic attack in numerous molecules.",
            "DMF is a very small molecule, and therefore CYP2E1 is a primary candidate that might mediate is side-chain hydroxylation.",
            "The expected primary product, 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol had demonstrated mutagenic activity\u2014even stronger than that of FFA\u2014in Salmonella strains expressing human SULTs.",
            "For these reasons, we performed SCGE assays in V79-hCYP2E1-hSULT1A1 cells as well as V79 control cells.",
            "The results were surprising in two respects: (1) the positive response in control V79 cells and (2) the lack of any impact of the human enzymes tested.",
            "However, point 1 has a precedent: Furan induced SCE in V79 and hCYP2E1-hSULT1A1 cells in an equal manner.",
            "One may speculate that V79 express some non-CYP enzymes, e.g. peroxidases or oxidases that can mediate the oxidative ring opening of furan and DMF, which could lead to a cross binding of DNA by DMF.",
            "This could be a possible explanation for why the SCGE assay detects the DNA damage caused by DMF, but not by FFA (se above).",
            "It should also be noted that the toxicity of DMF and FFA in the V79 cells was very different.",
            "Alternatively, these compounds may lead to DNA damage through an unidentified mode of action, not requiring reactive metabolites.",
            "The missing influence of human enzymes (point 2) may be owed to different factors, most likely in combination.",
            "(2a) DMF may be relatively resistant to metabolism.",
            "Indeed it is excreted in rat urine as a terminal metabolite of hexane; (2b) DMF is only moderately lipohilic and is therefore not expected to accumulate in the cells.",
            "This is toxicokinetically unfavorable in cell culture models, in which the volume of the medium usually exceeds the volume of the cells by a factor 1000\u2013100 000; (2c)",
            "The phase 1 metabolites of DMF are small, amphiliphilic molecules, expected to readily equilibrate with the extracellular space, i.e. formed by the enormous amount of medium present (2d); CYP2E1 may not be the optimal CYP form for metabolism of DMF; (2e) Potentially endogenous alcohol dehydrogenase expressed in V79 cells, which could further reduce the concentration of 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol, a potential proximate genotoxic; (2f) in the present study we noticed that possible DNA damage produced by FFA (even in SULT-expressing cells) is poorly detected in the SCGE assay; it is likely that the same is true for its congener, 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol.",
            "However, the genotoxicity of DMF and FFA in cells transfected with other metabolizing enzymes, like the V79-hCYP1A2-hSULT1A1 cells, could have given different results.",
            "In conclusion, in vitro exposure to DMF causes a concentration-dependent increase in DNA damage in V79 and V79-hCYP2E1-hSULT1A1 cells which were readily detected by the alkaline SCGE assay.",
            "Tests using the alkaline SCGE assay indicate that the previously reported genotoxicity of FFA is not accompanied by strand breaks.",
            "The alkaline SCGE is a sensitive assay, but should be used in conjunction with other mutagenicity/genotoxicity tests to evaluate the overall potential hazard of substituted furans."

        "paper_as_candidate_pool": [
            "Purpose",
            "To investigate whether or not low intensity radio frequency electromagnetic field exposure (RF-EME) associated with mobile phone use can affect human cells, we used a sensitive proteome analysis method to study changes in protein synthesis in cultured human cells.",
            "Methods",
            "Four different cell kinds were exposed to 2\u00a0W/kg specific absorption rate in medium containing 35S-methionine/cysteine, and autoradiography of 2D gel spots was used to measure the increased synthesis of individual proteins.",
            "Results",
            "While short-term RF-EME did not significantly alter the proteome, an 8-h exposure caused a significant increase in protein synthesis in Jurkat T-cells and human fibroblasts, and to a lesser extent in activated primary human mononuclear cells.",
            "Quiescent (metabolically inactive) mononuclear cells, did not detectably respond to RF-EME.",
            "Since RF exposure induced a temperature increase of less than 0.15\u00b0C, we suggest that the observed cellular response is a so called \u201cathermal\u201d effect of RF-EME.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Our finding of an association between metabolic activity and the observed cellular reaction to low intensity RF-EME may reconcile conflicting results of previous studies.",
            "We further postulate that the observed increased protein synthesis reflects an increased rate of protein turnover stemming from protein folding problems caused by the interference of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields with hydrogen bonds.",
            "Our observations do not directly imply a health risk.",
            "However, vis-a-vis a synopsis of reports on cells stress and DNA breaks, after short and longer exposure, on active and inactive cells, our findings may contribute to the re-evaluation of previous reports.",
            "Electronic supplementary material",
            "The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00420-010-0513-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
            "Introduction",
            "Whether or not low intensity radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure (RF-EME) associated with the use of GSM-1800 mobile phones can have direct effects on cells is a matter of debate.",
            "The energy transferred by these fields is certainly too weak to ionize molecules or break chemical bonds (Adair).",
            "So called thermal effects on cells, caused by energy transfer, are directly related to the specific absorption rate (SAR) and are well understood.",
            "Investigations of athermal cellular effects caused by low intensity exposure, in contrast, have generated conflicting data (Belyaev).",
            "This applies to epidemiologic studies and to laboratory investigations focusing on cellular effects such as DNA damage or proteome alterations (Blank).",
            "Early epidemiologic studies on mobile phone use did not reveal an associated health risk (Rothman et al.; Valberg).",
            "Subsequent studies described some evidence for enhanced cancer risk (Kundi et al.).",
            "More recently, an increased brain cancer risk associated with intensive phone use over many years was discussed (Hardell et al.; Hardell et al.; Kan et al.).",
            "Sadetzki et al. reported an exposure-related increase of parotoid gland tumors, which suggests that the possible risk and cellular mechanism is not cell type specific, but may affect various cells.",
            "Repacholi et al. described an increase in the incidence of lymphoma in sensitized transgenic mice.",
            "Their results were, however, not reproduced in follow-up studies (Utteridge et al.).",
            "An enhancement of genotoxicity was described (Maes et al.), but again could not be substantiated by the same team (Verschaeve et al.).",
            "DNA breaks after RF-EME have been described but could not be reproduced in other laboratories (Diem et al.; Speit et al.).",
            "Several studies have investigated effects of radiation exposure on specific proteins.",
            "Thus, Yilmaz et al., who investigated the effect of RF-EME on the expression level of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein by immunohistochemical staining, reported that exposure to the radiation emitted by a 900-MHz cellular phone for 20\u00a0min did not alter the level of bcl-2 in the brain and testes of rats.",
            "Sanchez et al. investigated the mobile phone radiation-induced stress response in human skin cells after exposure for 2\u00a0h per day and also found no changes.",
            "In contrast, in vitro exposure of EAhy926 cells to 900\u00a0MHz GSM microwave radiation induced a transient cellular stress response, judged by an increased phosphorylation of heat shock protein-27 (Leszczynski et al.).",
            "Results from Nylund and Leszczynski support the hypothesis that mobile phone radiation can affect the cytoskeleton and the physiological functions that are regulated by the cytoskeleton.",
            "More recently, Karinen et al. provided evidence that mobile phone radiation can alter protein expression in human skin.",
            "Blank has reviewed examples of direct molecular conformation changes caused by radio frequency radiation exposure.",
            "The observed changes in protein phosphorylation are consistent with the activation of a variety of cellular signal transduction pathways by mobile phone radiation, among them the hsp27/p38MAPK stress response (Leszczynski et al.).",
            "Friedman et al. described the rapid activation of ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), but not of the stress-related MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase) in response to various frequencies and intensities of RF-EME.",
            "The lack of consensus with regard to the difficulty to reproduce effects of RF-EME may to some extent reflect the large number of experimental variables, such as frequency, amplitude, modulation (Litovitz et al.), exposure time and cell types that must be controlled.",
            "In the present study, we measured the impact of RF-EME on the rate of synthesis of a range of proteins.",
            "Because any challenge to cells may eventually trigger an adaptive response, the measurement of protein synthesis offers a highly sensitive screening method to detect subtle effects.",
            "The applied methodology was based on metabolic labeling cells during RF exposure and subsequent resolution of protein extracts by two-dimensional electrophoresis in order to measure de novo protein synthesis and total protein amounts (Gerner et al.).",
            "To investigate whether or not cell types respond differently, we exposed different kinds of cells including proliferating Jurkat cells, cultured fibroblasts as well as quiescent and inflammatory stimulated primary human white blood cells.",
            "Materials and methods",
            "Exposure apparatus",
            "We used the sXc1800 exposure unit (IT\u2019IS, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland) to test radio frequency electromagnetic field exposures from mobile communication devices (Schuderer et al.).",
            "The unit was installed in a conventional cell incubator with 5% CO2 and saturated humidity.",
            "The exposure unit has two wave guides, which serve as chambers for cell growth and RF exposure.",
            "In every experiment, it allows for (and requires the) comparison of control cells and those exposed to modulated GSM 1,800\u00a0MHz fields.",
            "ELF magnetic fields may actively contribute cellular effects (Mild et al.).",
            "However, in our experiments, the background fields were identical between sham and real exposure and therefore cannot be held responsible for the observed differences.",
            "Double-blind experimental design",
            "Approximately 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells were used for each experiment.",
            "Cells were either exposed or mock-exposed to RF-EM under blinded conditions, followed by protein extraction and analyses.",
            "RF exposure was controlled by a computer program, which switched on the exposure in one waveguide while the other served as exposure control.",
            "The exposure settings were recorded in a coded file, and after the biochemical analysis of exposed and control cells, decoding was carried out by a coauthor (HPH) who was not involved in the exposure and biochemical analysis.",
            "In this manner, we excluded any direct and indirect investigator bias of the results.",
            "Exposure conditions",
            "In this study, we used modulations closely reflecting the technical specifications of GSM-1800.",
            "A GSM signal is modulated, i.e. it has different superordinated structures according to the transmission mode (\u201cGSM-basic\u201d for speech uplink or GSM-DTX for listening).",
            "A GSM basic signal is a multi-frame signal consisting of 26 frames, of which every 26th frame is blanked, which creates a low frequency (8\u00a0Hz) component.",
            "The GSM-DTX signal consists of periodical single bursts, with some multi-frames interspersed.",
            "For details see \u201cwww.itis.ethz.ch\u201d.",
            "A typical phone conversation is a mixture of listening (GSM-DTX) and talking (GSM basic).",
            "In the current study, we used a modulation mixture that consisted of about 66% GSM basic (talking) and 34% GSM-DTX (listening).",
            "The exposure time was 8\u00a0h.",
            "The intermittence pattern was 5\u00a0min.",
            "RF exposure \u201con\u201d and 10\u00a0min \u201coff\u201d (no exposure), to compare the very same conditions, which revealed DNA breaks (Diem et al.; Schwarz et al.).",
            "The exposure was 2\u00a0W/kg during the \u201con\u201d phase.",
            "With the chosen parameters, the controlled temperature difference between the two chambers (control and real exposure) was below 0.15\u00b0C, which, according to our experience, excludes a thermally induced effect in our system (Gerner et al.).",
            "Cell preparation",
            "Human Jurkat T-cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS under standard cell culture conditions.",
            "Primary human diploid fibroblasts (ES1 cells) were a kind gift of the workgroup R\u00fcdiger in Vienna.",
            "It allowed us to investigate the proteomes of the very same cell line and culture conditions, which upon radiation revealed DNA breaks (Diem et al.; Schwarz et al.).",
            "These cells were cultured in Dulbecco`s modified Eagle`s Medium (DMEM, Gibco), 10,000\u00a0IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 200\u00a0mM l-glutamine, 40\u00a0\u03bcg/ml neomycin and 10% FCS.",
            "Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (white blood cells\u2014WBC) were isolated from heparinized whole blood obtained from healthy donors (mixed with 2 vol. HBSS) by standard density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech).",
            "The interface cells were washed and resuspended in autologous (donor) plasma.",
            "Inflammatory activation of the cells was accomplished by the addition of 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL phytohaemagglutinin (PHA-P; Sigma) and 10\u00a0ng/mL LPS (Sigma).",
            "Cells were metabolically labeled with 0.2\u00a0mCi/mL 35S protein labeling mix containing 35S-methionine and 35S-cysteine (Trans35label, Biomedica, MP Biomedicals) during control exposure and real RF-EME at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.",
            "The incubation and labeling times were 2 and 4\u00a0h in exploratory experiments and 8\u00a0h in the final series with three independent repetitions per exposure condition.",
            "Subcellular fractionation",
            "After incubation and labeling of cells, cytoplasmic proteins were isolated as follows.",

            "The gel from sham exposed cells (reference) was compared to the gel from the cells with real exposure, using the TT900 S2S software (version 2006.0.2389, Nonlinear dynamics, Carlsbad, CA) and then evaluated with the Progenesis software PG200 (version 2006, Nonlinear) using the \u201csame spot\u201d algorithm.",
            "Spot assignment, background correction, normalization and statistical calculations (one way analysis of variance, ANOVA, calculated from three independent experimental replicates per group) were performed using this software package.",
            "If the \u201cP-value\u201d for a protein was \u22650.05, this was considered \u201cnot significant\u201d.",
            "For each data set (cell type), in each table, we summarized three independent experiments (pairs of sham and real exposed cells), where the differences between sham and real exposure are expressed as average \u201cincrease factor\u201d (x-fold higher) in real exposed cells.",
            "Results",
            "Jurkat cells",
            "Figure\u00a01 shows corresponding 2D gels derived from exposed and control cells.",
            "The separated proteins were q uantified for protein amounts (fluorescence detection) and protein synthesis (35S-autoradiography).",
            "The spot pattern obtained was very highly reproducible: 855 spots were consistently detected in six gels from three independent experiments, each with exposed and corresponding control cells.",
            "The average standard deviation of fluorescence spot intensities (18.8%) was determined from the three independent control cell gels.",
            "Fluorescence spot intensities for some individual proteins appeared to reveal an increased level in response to RF-EME.",
            "Application of strict spot quantification criteria, however, indicated that there were no significant differences between RF-EME-exposed and control cells.",
            "Autoradiographs of the same gels, however, revealed significant differences in the rate of de novo synthesis of several proteins (greater than 2 fold) between RF-EME and control cells.",
            "Figure\u00a01c, d shows the higher general autoradiograph intensity observed for radiation exposed cells.",
            "On average, the total 35S autoradiograph intensity was almost doubled [the measured increase was 93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028% (n\u00a0=\u00a03)].",
            "Actually all detectable protein spots displayed an increased 35S incorporation rate.",
            "We categorized a protein as specifically up-regulated if the normalized integrated 35S autoradiograph spot intensity was at least two-fold greater than the corresponding control cell spot with an ANOVA P-value of less than 0.05.",
            "Using this criterion, fourteen proteins were found to be specifically up-regulated and were subsequently identified by mass spectrometry as described in Materials and Methods (Table\u00a01 and supplementary data).",
            "Figure\u00a02 provides three examples of proteins specifically up-regulated by RF-EME: heat shock protein 70, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 14 and 26S protease regulatory subunit 6B.",
            "Figure\u00a03 shows peptide fragmentation mass spectra of peptides derived from ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 14 and 26S protease regulatory subunit 6 in order to demonstrate the high degree of reliability of the protein identification procedure used.",
            "The RF-EME induced increase in protein synthesis (Fig.\u00a04a\u2013f) was highly reproducible.",
            "Fibroblasts",
            "Cultured human fibroblasts showed the highest level of responsiveness to RF-EME (Fig.\u00a04e, f; Table\u00a02) with an average protein synthesis increase of 128\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022% (three independent experiments).",
            "Thirteen of the fourteen proteins whose rate of de novo synthesis was increased in Jurkat cells were also synthesized at a higher rate in fibroblasts.",
            "As well as these, the rates of synthesis of annexin A1 and A5 were found to be significantly increased (Table\u00a02).",
            "This finding suggests that the proteome alterations in responsive cells induced by RF-EME exposure are characteristic for this kind of cell stress.",
            "White blood cells",
            "Primary mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood (white blood cells, WBC) responded only marginally to RF-EME (Fig.\u00a04g, h; Table\u00a03).",
            "The apparent increase in 35S incorporation was less than 10%, which is within the margin of error of the applied methodology.",
            "Inflammatory stimulation of WBCs by treatment with lipopolysaccharide and phytohaemagglutinin increased the level of protein synthesis by these cells (compare Fig.\u00a04g\u2013i), which is consistent with the induction of cell proliferation as previously described in more detail (Traxler et al.).",
            "Notably, RF-EME further increased the level of 35S incorporation by the stimulated cells (compare Fig.\u00a04i\u2013j) by an average of 43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013% (three independent experiments with three different donors).",
            "The proteome alterations were, however, less compared to those observed in Jurkat cells and fibroblasts.",
            "Only one protein, hsp60, was induced more than two-fold (Table\u00a04).",
            "Discussion",
            "We used a highly sensitive method of measuring protein synthesis rates and protein amounts to investigate the potential effects of low-intensity mobile phone radiation exposure on cells.",
            "Our results show that the rate of protein synthesis in proliferating cells is increased by long-term (8\u00a0h) RF-EME, while no effect was detectable in quiescent white blood cells treated in the same manner.",
            "Although the observed changes reached no statistical significance at short exposure times, we observed some trends consistent with but also extend observations made by Nylund and Leszczynski, who used the same exposure system, but only measured protein amounts (and not de novo synthesis).",
            "Usefully, our results appear to reconcile a number of conflicting previous findings.",
            "First, we found both RF-EME responsive and RF-EME-insensitive cells (compare Tables\u00a01, 2 with Table\u00a03).",
            "The RF-EME insensitive quiescent WBCs (Table\u00a03) were rendered sensitive to RF-EME by inflammatory activation (Fig.\u00a04).",
            "Inflammatory activation of WBC induces T-cell proliferation and consequently an increased rate of protein synthesis (Traxler et al.).",
            "Thus, our data suggest that proliferating cells with high protein synthesis rates are more sensitive to RF-EME than cells with lower protein production.",
            "Many studies have been performed with quiescent white blood cells, which were also insensitive under our experimental conditions.",
            "Second, the exposure time seems to be a critical factor.",
            "In our preliminary experiments, we did not observe significant effects with 2 and 4\u00a0h exposure times (data not shown).",
            "An 8-h exposure was required to obtain reproducible and significant effects, a time much longer than the longest exposure time used in most other studies.",
            "Third, the determination of protein amounts by spot integration is not very precise.",
            "Silver staining in particular, does not produce reliable quantitative data (White et al.).",
            "Standard deviations obtained with the much more accurate fluorescence detection methods are usually of the order of 25%.",
            "Consequently, subtle alterations may easily be missed due to limited sensitivity.",
            "Possible mechanisms",
            "During electromagnetic exposure, we applied 5\u00a0min of \u201cexposure on\u201d and 10\u00a0min of \u201coff\u201d on the same cell types and/or conditions, which revealed DNA breaks (Diem et al.; Franzellitti et al.; Schwarz et al.).",
            "Interestingly, we found the same cells reactive (e.g. fibroblasts, Table\u00a02) or nonreactive (e.g. na\u00efve lymphocytes, Table\u00a03), when investigating protein synthesis.",
            "This may suggest a common underlying mechanism between DNA breaks and increased protein synthesis in reactive cells.",
            "With this exposure regime, the temperature difference between exposed cells and control cells was less than 0.15\u00b0C, we exclude a heat-related response.",
            "Heat-induced proteome alterations detectable with our proteome profiling methodology would require temperature differences greater than 1\u00b0C.",
            "Furthermore, a temperature increase of even 1\u00b0C does not affect e.g. TCP-1 family members (Gerner et al.).",
            "We conclude that the warming of the cell cultures caused by RF exposure was too low to account for the present observations.",
            "Most of the proteins found to be induced by RF-EME are chaperones, which are mediators of protein folding.",
            "Since the applied electromagnetic fields were very weak, the direct and active denaturation of existing proteins by RF-EME exposure appears unlikely to underlie the observed increased level of protein synthesis.",
            "Resonance phenomena may concentrate radiation exposure-mediated physical energy on hot spots and have already been suggested to cause biological effects (Belyaev).",
            "Indeed, exposure to low frequency electromagnetic fields caused effects, which were reduced by noise signals (Litovitz et al.), providing further support for the concept of resonance as an underlying condition.",
            "Hydrogen bonds are known to resonate with microwaves.",
            "Folding of newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum occurs via a process involving the formation of intermediate folded structures (Arai and Kuwajima) mediated by several chaperones (Deuerling and Bukau).",
            "This process could potentially respond in a very sensitive fashion to radiation-induced excitation of hydrogen bonds as this could cause a temporary disturbance of spatial orientation.",
            "An increased rate of inappropriate folding of newly synthesized proteins would not affect existing proteins and thus render cell function intact for some time (unless key labile proteins are affected).",
            "Furthermore, such a mechanism would not necessarily have a significant impact on total protein amounts.",
            "However, later on it would increase the protein synthesis rate in response to an increased rate of turnover of the newly folded proteins.",
            "This interpretation plausibly explains the reported increased level of protein synthesis.",
            "Essentially all detectable proteins displayed an increased synthesis rate, which indicates a general compensatory response, e.g. to a hampered supply of functional proteins.",
            "Proteins with the highest response (Tables\u00a01, 2) are involved in the chaperoning of newly synthesized proteins and protein turnover.",
            "Chaperones such as 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, heat-shock proteins and T-complex protein 1 family members are directly involved in protein folding and assist folding of newly synthesized proteins (Deuerling and Bukau).",
            "Neutral alpha-glucosidase AB is an important endoplasmic reticulum protein responsible for quality control and glycoprotein processing (Ellgaard and Helenius).",
            "Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 14, also termed deubiquitinating enzyme 14, is required for proteasomal processing of ubiquitinated substrates (Koulich et al.).",
            "The 26S protease regulatory subunit 6B is also involved in ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and in transcriptional regulation (Choi et al.).",
            "Elongation factor 2 is actually indispensable for protein synthesis (Perentesis et al.).",
            "Exposure time matters",
            "Our data complement those of Lee et al. who did not find changes in the expression levels of HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27, or MAPK phosphorylation in Jurkat cells exposed to RF-EM for 30\u00a0min and 1\u00a0h.",
            "In our experiments, increased protein synthesis was only observed after an 8-h exposure time and was in fact fully reversible within 2\u00a0h (data not shown).",
            "This is also in agreement with Sanchez et al. and Yilmaz et al. who found no changes associated with exposure times of 2\u00a0h and 20\u00a0min, respectively, i.e. changes in the rate of protein synthesis are induced by long exposures to low intensity RF-EM.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Our data describe cell responses to RF-EME exposure specifically observed in actively proliferating cells.",
            "When investigating protein synthesis, we found the same cell types nonreactive or reactive, compared to those to reveal DNA breaks (Diem et al.; Schwarz et al.).",
            "Active cells continuously repair DNA-damage as it occurs as side product of DNA transcription or respiratory chain products (Alberts et al.; Branden and Tooze).",
            "Therefore, a subtle inhibition of any part of the anti-oxidant protection or the DNA repair system would accumulate damaged DNA.",
            "Consequently, interference with protein expression may explain the DNA changes found by others (Belyaev et al.; Diem et al.; Schwarz et al.) as indicator for a risk associated with long-term exposure.",
            "The observed proteome alterations support a novel mechanistic model for the understanding of RF-EME induced bioeffects: this model is based on radiation-induced disturbances of hydrogen bonds, which may be essential during the protein folding process.",
            "Our results do not directly indicate a health risk.",
            "However, the finding that metabolically active and/or proliferating cells are more responsive to RF-EME implies a higher sensitivity of growing organisms."

            "INTRODUCTION",
            "Dimethylformamide (DMF, CAS 68-12-2) is a polar solvent widely used as an organic solvent in industry (e.g. for the production of acrylic resin, synthetic leather, films, synthetic textiles etc.).",
            "Intake of DMF may be mainly from inhalation of its vapor and by physical contact with skin, and occupational exposure to DMF may cause nausea, abdominal pain, and alcohol intolerance.",
            "Especially, DMF has been shown to induce hepatotoxicity and liver dysfunction in animals and humans by many investigators, and it is known that the primary target organ of DMF is the liver in animals and humans.",
            "DMF is hydroxylated at its methyl moieties by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) to produce N-methyl-N-hydroxymethylformamide (DMF-OH), the generated DMF-OH being biotransformed to N-methylformamide (NMF) by a non-enzymatic or enzymatic reaction, undergoing further reactions that result in xenobiotic enzymes.",
            "The hepatotoxicity by the DMF itself and/or its intermediates are hepatotoxic.",
            "In the liver activated intermediates such as NMF are more toxic than DMF itself.",
            "The activated intermediates have high polarity and reactivity.",
            "This hepatotoxicity is induced through covalent binding with macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins.",
            "But, actually, in most chemical factories, mixture rather than a single substance is open used.",
            "However most of the risk assessment study was focused on a single substance.",
            "Mixture can have different physical and chemical properties that different from the unique characteristics of each chemical.",
            "Therefore, its toxic effects on the human body can also be changed.",
            "It was reported that the metabolic ratio of DMF as a single exposure is differ from co-exposure with methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and/or toluene.",
            "And simultaneous exposure of alcohol and DMF can cause synergetic effect to liver function abnormality.",
            "In our previous study, we found workers in synthetic leather and synthetic textile factories that were simultaneously exposed to DMF and toluene and/or DMF and MEK.",
            "However, the effect of simultaneous exposure to DMF and other chemicals was not well investigated.",

The effects of hepatotoxic DMF and Tol did not provoke hepatotoxicity clearly in rats of the D1, D2, T, D1T, and D2T treated by DMF and Tol, whereas in the D3 group receiving 1,800 mg/kg of DMF, signs of vacuolization of hepatocytes and altered cell focus around the central vein region (Fig. 1C1) and serious zonal necrosis around the central vein in rats treated with both DMF (1,800 mg/kg) and Tol (D3T) could be observed (Fig. 1C2).",
            "Activities of CYP-dependent catalytic enzymes and immunoblot assay.",
            "The effects of increasing doses of DMF and simultaneously treatment with Tol on total microsomal CYP content and the activity of CYP-dependent catalytic enzymes are presented in Table 1.",
            "By repeated treatment, the microsomal CYP contents in single DMF treated groups were significantly increased according to increasing dosage (p < 0.05), whereas it was decreased in groups treated with both DMF and Tol and was dependent on DMF dosage.",
            "EROD, PROD, and \u03c1NPH are considered to be associated with the activity of CYP1A1 (EROD), CYP2B1/2 (PROD), and CYP2E1 (\u03c1NPH), respectively.",
            "In this study, no significant changes in EROD and PROD activities were observed among the control, single treated with DMF, and treated with both DMF and Tol, but EROD activity between the D1 and D1T group was only statistically significant (p < 0.05).",
            "\u03c1NPH activity associated with CYP2E1 increased steadily with the increase in the concentration of DMF and the increase was prominent in the group single treated with DMF (p < 0.05).",
            "Fig. 2 shows the results of immunoblot analyses which were carried out with microsomes from control rats and rats treated with DMF and both DMF and Tol using MAb specific to CYP2E1.",
            "The densities for CYP2E1 were considerably enhanced according to the dosages of DMF and the increase existed in the treated groups, with a larger increase for the rats treated with both DMF and Tol than the groups of rats which were treated with a single compound.",

            "DISCUSSION",
            "When living organisms are exposed to environmental xenobiotics, they are able to produces specific enzymes and metabolize and excrete the metabolites from their bodies via detoxification processes.",
            "The CYP are major enzymes for the metabolism of xenobiotics as well as for certain classes of endobiotics, including fatty acid, steroids, and prostaglandins.",
            "More than 100 forms of CYP have been identified and classified into over 20 different families and subfamilies, and it is known that they are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endobiotics through over 60 different reactions that metabolize hundreds of thousands of different chemicals.",
            "Among than, CYP2E1 isozyme plays a key role in the bioactivation of a variety of low molecular weight protoxicants and procarcinogens, including many solvents such as benzene, trichloroethylene, acetone, DMF, and ethanol.",
            "Guengerich et al. reported that CYP2E1 catalyzed the metabolic oxidation and toxification of N-methylformamide by an inhibition study of the enzyme, Nakajima reported that CYP1A, CYP2B and CYP3A2 were involved in the metabolisms of acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride and DMF.",
            "He also found that liver damage was induced remarkably in the group of animals treated with DMF after being retreated with acetone, with the suggestion that the CYP2E1 isozyme was involved in the metabolism of DMF.",
            "We previously observed that the CYP2E1 isozyme was inducible by DMF using a monoclonal anti-mouse CYP2E1 antibody.",
            "Many studies of DMF have been carried out as a single compound even though most workers are exposed simultaneously to DMF as well as Tol and/or MEK.",
            "Studies of simultaneous exposure have not been clearly demonstrated.",
            "Thus, we examined the effect of Tol on DMF-induced hepatotoxicity, monitoring the induction of CYP and the other related enzymes in rat liver.",
            "(i) CYP content and activities of PROD and \u03c1NPH were increased by increasing the dosage of DMF, but the combination of DMF and Tol decreased activity compared to single treatment with DMF. (ii)",
            "The densities of CYP2E1 were also considerably enhanced by the dosages of DMF and the blot densities were prominently increased in the groups treated with both DMF and Tol compared with groups of single treatment with DMF. (iii)",
            "No significant changes were observed in the activities of GST and GSHPx and LPO contents.",
            "(iv) Liver function tests showed that AST, ALT, and ALP were increased by treatment with DMF and Tol and with signs of moderate and dramatic hepatic injuries in the rats of the highly exposed group (D3) and the combinatory group of DMF and Tol (DT3).",
            "The hepatotoxicities induced by DMF and by its de-methylated metabolite, NMF, have been observed in several species including rats, mice, and humans, and the hepatotoxicities were more severe by NMF than by DMF itself.",
            "As described in the introduction, DMF is hydroxylated at its methyl moieties by CYP to DMF-OH and NMF is generated by an enzymatic and non-enzymatic reaction, accompanying the production of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) during the degradation of DMF and NMF under aerobic conditions.",
            "Thus, ROSs and reactive intermediates cause liver toxicity, usually increasing in serum transaminases, such as AST and ALT which have been useful indicators in the evaluation of liver injury for workers occupationally exposed to DMF.",
            "ROSs are produced endogenously by normal metabolic processes, but their levels are markedly increased by environmental pollutants such as chemicals, heavy metals, cigarette smoke, and ionizing radiation.",
            "ROSs possess the potential to damage either cellular or organelle membranes and macromolecules, causing lipid peroxidation, and alterations of nucleic acids and proteins.",
            "Living organisms are protected from the damages of ROS by several defence mechanisms, such as the actions of superoxide dismutase, catalase, GST, and GSHPx.",
            "The main function of GST is to conjugate electrophilic and hydrophobic compounds with cellular glutathione and solubilize for excretion.",
            "These reactions result in the detoxification of many endogenous electrophiles as well as in environmental chemicals.",
            "In the present study, no significant change in glutathionelinked enzyme activities, such as GST and GSHPx were observed between control and the groups of animals treated with single and combined chemicals.",
            "However, the levels of CYP2E1 were considerably enhanced according to the dosages of DMF.",
            "Immunoblot densities against CYP2E1 were prominently increased in the combined group compared with the single treatment group.",
            "Also, the signs of hepatic injury appeared in the livers of the rats of the highly exposed group (D3) and the effects were dramatic in the rats treated with DMF and Tol (DT3).",
            "Thus, our results from this study suggest that CYP2E1 isozyme was inducible by DMF and Tol, and induction by Tol is responsible for the accelerated effect of the formation of NMF by induced CYP2E1 and the generated NMF might directly induce hepatotoxicity.",

            "This study aimed to examine night shift workers and their changes in thyroid stimulating hormones (TSH) levels over time.",
            "Methods",
            "Medical check-up data (2011\u20132015) were obtained from 967 female workers at a university hospital in Incheon, Korea.",
            "Data regarding TSH levels were extracted from the records, and 2015 was used as a reference point to determine night shift work status.",
            "The relationships between TSH levels and night shift work in each year were analyzed using the general linear model (GLM).",
            "The generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to evaluate the repeated measurements over the 5-year period.",
            "Results",
            "The GEE analysis revealed that from 2011 to 2015, night shift workers had TSH levels that were 0.303 mIU/L higher than the levels of non-night shift workers (95\u00a0% CI: 0.087\u20130.519 mIU/L, p\u2009=\u20090.006) after adjusting for age and department.",
            "When we used TSH levels of 4.5\u2009\u2265\u2009mIU/L to identify subclinical hypothyroidism, night shift workers exhibited a 1.399 fold higher risk of subclinical hypothyroidism (95\u00a0% CI: 1.050\u20131.863, p\u2009=\u20090.022), compared to their non-night shift counterparts.",
            "Conclusions",
            "This result of this study suggests that night shift workers may have an increased risk of thyroid diseases, compared to non-night shift workers.",
            "Background",
            "Night shift work has well-known adverse effects on health.",
            "According to the Labor Standards Act, night shift work is defined as work that is performed between 10\u00a0PM and 6\u00a0AM the next day, and an estimated 10.2\u201314.5\u00a0% of wage workers in Korea (1.27\u20131.97 million people) perform night shift work.",
            "Many studies have revealed that night shift work can cause cardiovascular diseases, sleep disorders, peptic ulcers, and breast cancer among women.",
            "The effect of night shift work on health is mainly thought to be related to its interference with circadian rhythms.",
            "For example, night shift work interferes with the worker\u2019s natural circadian timing system, which disturbs their normal circadian rhythms and physiological functions.",
            "Previous research has also revealed that night shift workers disturbed levels of prolactin, cortisol, and growth hormone.",
            "Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels change in accordance with circadian rhythms, and with sleep patterns.",
            "However, very little research has evaluated the association of thyroid diseases with night shift work.",
            "One study that examined thyrotropin rhythm and night shift workers, and another study examined a correlation between TSH levels and night shift work.",
            "Nevertheless, few studies have examined TSH levels over time.",
            "Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the changes in TSH levels over time among female workers according to their night shift status.",
            "Methods",
            "Data collection",
            "This study retrospectively evaluated data from employee medical check-ups that were performed at a university hospital in Incheon between 2011 and 2015.",
            "Our institutional review board approved the study\u2019s retrospective design.",
            "Most night shift workers at the university hospital were nurses, therefore, we ultimately evaluated data from 967 female adult workers.",
            "The Employee medical check-ups were performed using the same requirements as general and special medical check-ups and workers were required to fast for at least 8\u00a0h.",
            "This study collected data regarding sex, age, height, weight, night shift work, and TSH levels.",
            "The normal ranges were defined as 0.17\u20134.5 mIU/L for TSH and 0.8\u20131.90\u00a0ng/dL free T4, which were analyzed using blood testing (Cobas E601; Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany).",
            "Four workers with thyroid diseases (abnormal TSH and free T4 levels) were excluded from the final analyses.",
            "The workers were categorized according to age (\u226429\u00a0years, 30\u201339 years, 40\u201349 years, and \u226550\u00a0years) and body mass index (BMI) (<25\u00a0kg/m2 or \u226525\u00a0kg/m2).",
            "Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data regarding smoking, alcohol drinking, and exercise habits.",
            "Non-/ex-smokers were defined as individuals who had not smoked within the last 6\u00a0months, and current smokers were defined as individuals who had smoked within the last 6\u00a0months.",
            "Non-/moderate drinkers were defined as individuals who consumed \u22642 servings of alcohol per day and excessive drinkers were defined as individuals who consumed >2 servings of alcohol per day.",
            "Exercise status was categorized as regular exercise (at least 30/min of exercise once per week) or no regular exercise.",
            "Night shift workers, (\u22654 night shifts per month) were identified based on their status in 2015, when all night shift workers were required to undergo a special medical check-up Departmental status was defined as nursing (general ward, outpatient unit, emergency room, operating room, and/or intensive care unit) or other (e.g., support workers or administrative workers).",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "The general linear model (GLM) was used to analyze annual differences in TSH levels between the night shift workers and non-night shift workers (2011 to 2015",
            "The generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to estimate the correlation among the repeated TSH measures throughout the 5-year period, with night shift work defined as the independent variable and TSH levels as the dependent variable.",
            "TSH levels were reported as a continuous variable for most analyses, and as a categorical variable for the odds ratio (OR) analyses (subclinical hypothyroidism: \u22654.5 mIU/L).",
            "Age and department were defined as confounding variables, and were included in the GEE analysis.",
            "All data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 19.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).",
            "Results",
            "Characteristics of the 967 included workers, who were categorized as night shift workers (546 workers, 56.5\u00a0%) and non-night shift workers (421 workers, 43.5\u00a0%) are shown in Table\u00a01.",
            "Night shift workers were significantly younger than non-night shift workers and more likely to be excessive drinkers.",
            "However, we did not observe any shift-specific differences in BMI, smoking status, and exercise status.",
            "We identified 654 nursing workers and 313 workers who were employed in other departments.",
            "Approximately 74.5\u00a0% of the nursing workers were night shift workers, while 80.7\u00a0% of the other workers were non-night shift workers.",
            "The annual mean TSH levels for each group are shown in Table\u00a02.",
            "The average TSH levels were 3.27 mIU/mL among night shift workers and 2.98 mIU/mL among non-night shift workers; the difference was not statistically significant for each year.",
            "TSH levels were treated as single points in the GLM analysis to evaluate whether night shift work was associated with a linear change in TSH levels.",
            "After adjusting for age, we observed that night shift work was not associated with changes in TSH levels at each year with night shift workers having higher TSH levels (Table\u00a03).",
            "As the GLM cannot evaluate repeated measures over an observed period, we performed a GEE analysis to evaluate the relationship between night shift work and TSH levels during 2011\u20132015 (Table\u00a03).",
            "The GEE analysis included 967 workers, and included age and department as covariates.",
            "Night shift workers had TSH levels that were 0.303 mIU/L higher, compared to the non-night shift workers (p\u2009=\u20090.006).",
            "We also performed GLM and GEE analyses to evaluate the risk of subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH levels of \u22654.5 mIU/L) (Table\u00a04).",
            "In the GLM analysis, night shift workers had not risk of subclinical hypothyroidism, compared to non-night shift workers except in 2012 (OR : 1.912, p\u2009=\u20090.025).",
            "In the GEE analysis, night shift workers had a 1.399-fold higher risk of subclinical hypothyroidism, compared to non-night shift workers (p\u2009=\u20090.022) (Table\u00a04).",
            "Discussion",
            "Serum TSH measurement is the most sensitive method for identifying thyroid dysfunction However, few studies have evaluated whether night shift workers develop thyroid diseases, and only a few studies have examined the relationship between TSH levels and night shift work.",
            "In a study suggesting TSH levels with sleep time and another study shows that insomnia is associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer among postmenopausal women.",
            "Moreover, a cross-sectional study of male night shift workers revealed that night shift workers had significantly higher TSH levels, compared to their day shift counterparts.",
            "In the present study, we retrospectively evaluated longitudinal data regarding TSH levels, and found that night shift workers exhibited higher TSH levels, compared to day shift workers, in the age-adjusted annual GLM analyses but not statistically significant..",
            "However, the GEE analyses (adjusted for age and department) confirmed that the TSH levels were higher among night shift workers over the 5-year study period.",
            "The GEE analysis was adjusted for department because approximately 70\u00a0% of the nurses were night shift workers.",
            "Our results suggest that night shift work might be associated with the risk of subclinical hypothyroidism, and that this risk increased with longer employment as a night shift worker.",
            "Subclinical hypothyroid is a condition with normal free T4 levels and elevated TSH levels, which is exclusively diagnosed using screening test results.",
            "In the general population, subclinical hypothyroidism has a reported prevalence of 4\u201315\u00a0%, which varies according to the specific study.",
            "When anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies are present, there is a 25\u201350\u00a0% risk of subclinical hypothyroidism progressing to overt hypothyroidism within 20\u00a0years.",
            "If autoantibodies are not present, TSH levels of >3.0\u20134.5 mIU/L are considered a risk factor for progression, and regular observation is recommended.",
            "The current guidelines for the initial treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism recommend starting drug treatment at TSH levels of >10 mIU/L (while considering other co-existing conditions), although it remains unclear whether drug treatment is beneficial for patients with TSH levels of 4.5\u201310 mIU/L.",
            "In the present study, we found that age-adjusted TSH levels of \u22654.5 mIU/L among night shift workers during 2011\u20132015 were associated with a 1.4-fold higher risk of subclinical hypothyroidism, compared to non-night shift workers.",
            "In that analysis, we adjusted for age because TSH levels are known to increase with age.",
            "There are several potential explanations for why TSH levels were higher among night shift workers, compared to non-night shift workers.",
            "First, TSH levels exhibit a normal circadian rhythm, with study-specific peaks at approximately 2\u20134\u00a0AM and troughs at approximately 4\u20138\u00a0PM.",
            "However, this circadian rhythm assumes that workers have a normal sleep at night, and night shift work-related changes in sleep schedule, timing, and quality may alter the body\u2019s normal circadian rhythm and lead to an abnormal TSH circadian rhythm.",
            "Furthermore, some authors have suggested that sleep deprivation promotes oscillations in the TSH circadian rhythm, which increases the likelihood that TSH levels rise when workers are deprived of sleep after their night shift.",
            "Second, other studies have found that night shift work disturbs women\u2019s circadian rhythm and induces changes in their female hormone levels, reproductive system, and menstrual cycle.",
            "Thus, women might be more sensitive to night shift work-related hormonal changes that could alter TSH levels.",
            "Third, nocturnal eating may affect hormone levels (e.g., TSH, insulin, and glucagon), and it is possible that night shift work might lead to irregular eating habits and nocturnal eating, which might lead to increases in TSH levels.",
            "Fourth, some studies have also found that night shift work can increase the risk of autoimmune disease and altered immune system function, which might lead to increased TSH levels among night shift workers.",
            "Although the present study was not designed to identify the causal factors that lead to the increased TSH levels among night shift workers, we did observe an increase in TSH levels among night shift workers, compared to non-night shift workers.",
            "Furthermore, we assume that night shift work might increase the risk of subclinical hypothyroidism.",
            "The present study has several limitations that warrant consideration.",
            "First, we only evaluated female workers at a hospital (as most workers were female and/or nurses), and it is possible that our results may not be observed among men.",
            "Second, there was noticeable heterogeneity in the amount and type of night shift work, which included traditional night shifts, day and night shifts, and on-call shifts.",
            "This heterogeneity may limit the validity of our analyses.",
            "Third, our data were obtained from employee medical check-ups, and it is possible that our data regarding special diseases or drug history might not be accurate.",
            "Fourth, we defined the workers\u2019 departments and night shift work statuses based on their status in 2015, and it is possible that not all individuals in the night shift worker group were consistently working night shifts throughout the study period.",
            "Fifth, blood samples were obtained at different times, and it is possible that the hormone levels did not reflect circadian rhythm-specific changes, as night shift workers were evaluated during their night shift, while day shift workers were evaluated during their day shift.",
            "Despite these limitations, this study used cross-sectional repeated measures data from a large sample during a 5-year period, which may help overcome these limitations.",
            "Conclusions",
            "In conclusion, we found that night shift work was associated with increased TSH levels among female workers at an university hospital.",
            "We believe that these findings may help increase awareness of thyroid disease occurrence among night shift workers.",
            "Furthermore, we hope that this study can provide the foundation for detailed studies regarding the effects of night shift work on thyroid function and disease, and the association between night shift work duration and TSH levels."

            "Shift workers represent a high-risk group for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome; however, the underlying reasons for this are still not completely understood.",
            "Shift work is a work schedule that involves irregular or unusual hours compared with those of a normal daytime work schedule.",
            "Several types of work schedules can be described as shift work, including night work and rotating shift work).",
            "In recent studies, significant associations have been found between shift work, especially night shift work, and the risk of CVD, metabolic syndrome, and cancer).",
            "In an analysis of systematic review and metaanalysis, Vyas et al. showed that shift work was associated with myocardial infarction (risk ratio [RR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15\u20131.31) and ischemic stroke (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01\u20131.09)).",
            "They also indicated that night shift work was associated with the greatest increase in the risk for coronary events (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13\u20131.76).",
            "Moreover, Vetter et al. suggested that over a 24-year observation period, longer duration of rotating night shift work was associated with a statistically significant increase in CHD risk).",
            "Some studies have indicated that shift work is associated with not only CVD but also neoplasm.",
            "Hansen and Lassen recently reported an increased risk of breast cancer among female military employees working night shifts).",
            "Systemic inflammation, measured using high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), has been associated with the risk of CVD and stroke, in addition to classical risk factors such as hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, dyslipidemia (DL), and smoking).",
            "Inflammatory cytokines such as hs-CRP and IL-6 are being investigated not only as inflammatory markers but also as prognostic markers for CVD, stroke, and mortality).",
            "In unstable coronary artery disease, increased levels of systemic markers of inflammation, such as CRP and IL-6, have been reported).",
            "Large cohort studies have shown an association between elevated levels of circulating CRP and IL-6 and increased risk for cardiac events or death).",
            "Therefore, examining the relationship between work schedule and measured systemic inflammation may help clarify one of the reasons why shift work leads to increased risk of CVD.",
            "In addition, some observational studies have showed that higher levels of work engagement and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with lower inflammatory cytokines levels).",
            "However, the association between work schedule and inflammatory cytokine levels remains unclear.",

            "In addition, the following two analyses were performed as sensitivity analysis; the working form was divided into only night shift and other, and without excluding those who had a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, malignant tumor, and depression, which are expected to be related to IL-6.",

            "There were 3660 participants (69.6%) who worked regular work schedules, 181 (3.4%) worked shifts without night work, 1276 (24.3%) worked shifts with night work, and 142 (2.7%) had schedules with only night work.",
            "Night workers were older.",
            "Years of education < 12 years, hours worked per week < 40 h, and household income < 2.99 million JPY/year were much more prevalent among night workers.",
            "The unadjusted associations between log-transformed IL-6/hs-CRP and work schedule are shown in Table 2 and Fig.",
            "1.",
            "The participant group with only night work was significantly related to higher levels of log-transformed IL-6 compared with the group of regular work.",
            "On the contrary, hs-CRP was not.",
            "Table 3 shows multivariate regression analysis log-transformed IL-6 and log-transformed hs-CRP for age, sex, years of education, hours worked per week, annual household income, BMI, laboratory data (LDL-C, HbA1c), and job stress.",
            "As shown in Model 1, participants with only night work had significantly higher levels of log-transformed IL-6 than those with regular work schedules (\u03b2 = 0.078, standard error [SE] = 0.023, P < 0.001).",
            "The results remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex (Model 2; \u03b2 = 0.087, SE = 0.008, P = 0.001), years of education, hours worked per week, annual household income, BMI, laboratory data (LDL-C, HbA1c), and job stress (Model 3; \u03b2 = 0.058, SE = 0.023, P = 0.01).",
            "Similar results were also observed in the sensitivity analysis (Table 4).",
            "However, there was no significant association between work schedule and hs-CRP level.",
            "Discussion",
            "The purpose of this study was to examine the association between work schedule and inflammatory cytokine levels in a cohort of Japanese workers.",
            "We found that participants who worked only night work had significantly higher IL-6 levels than those who had regular work schedules.",
            "Our findings were interesting in the following points.",
            "Working only night work was associated with higher levels of IL-6, but shift work alone was not.",
            "We conducted two types of sensitivity analyses to confirm this finding.",
            "In the first, the work schedule was divided into two groups: only night work and all other shifts.",
            "The result indicated that participants who worked only night work had higher levels of IL-6 than those who worked other shifts.",
            "In the second analysis, we did not exclude participants with a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, malignant tumor, and depression, which are expected to be related to IL-6.",
            "We analyzed the association between work schedule and IL-6 and obtained a similar result.",
            "There are several reasons why only night work might influence IL-6 levels.",
            "The first possible reason is that insufficient sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance, which generate chronic stress, may be linked to increased IL-6 levels.",
            "Insufficient sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance are much more common among only night workers than other workers.",
            "A recent study found increased 24-hour urinary norepinephrine, a stress hormone, in people with both sleep restriction and circadian rhythm disturbances).",
            "Lutgendorf et al. suggested that chronic stressors in older women are associated with significant increases in IL-6 over and above those associated with normal aging).",
            "In another study, Maes et al. found that psychological stress significantly increased the stimulated production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist, interferon gamma, and IL-10).",
            "However, in our study, even after adjusting for job stress, there was an association between only night shift workers and higher Il-6 level.",
            "It is expected that chronic stress from insufficient sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance may be related to a higher IL-6 level in people who only night work.",
            "A second possible reason for the effect of only night work is that lower SES may be linked to increased IL-6 levels.",
            "Recently, researchers have focused on the association between lifestyle, SES, and inflammatory cytokines.",
            "Higher levels of IL-6 are strongly related to aging, sex, obesity, high rates of smoking), alcohol consumption), and physical inactivity).",
            "In some large cohort studies, factors associated with low SES, such as education and income, were associated with high IL-6 levels).",
            "The present study corroborated these previous findings (Supplementary Table 1).",
            "Our study showed that lower education and household income levels were related to higher IL-6 levels.",
            "Thus, night workers, who tended to have lower SES, may have had higher IL-6 levels.",
            "Added to the sensitivity analyses in this study, we believe our findings are valid for helping to explain one of the underlying mechanisms of CVD onset in people who only work night shifts.",
            "The other important results were as follows.",
            "There was no significant association between hs-CRP and work schedule.",
            "A previous study showed that elevated stress was not significantly associated with lower CRP levels).",
            "Because stress may not be related to hs-CRP, it is possible that this study did not show a significant relationship.",
            "Because night workers are groups at high risk for CVD onset who tend to have higher IL-6 levels, more unhealthy lifestyles, and lower SES, various intervention programs need to be implemented in these populations.",
            "Screening programs for modifiable risk factors including DL, smoking, glucose intolerance, and HT among night workers should be carried out.",
            "Night workers should be educated about CVD and the risks of developing CVD to forestall or avert the earliest clinical manifestations of disease.",
            "Night workers should be supported in efforts to lower their IL-6 levels by encouraging exercise and smoking cessation, which can lead to preventing CVD.",
            "There were several limitations to our study.",
            "First, our study was a cross-sectional design and causal inferences could not be made because of the inability to determine temporal sequence.",
            "Prospective study designs should be considered in further research on these relationships to provide more insight on the question of the causal direction.",
            "Second, we used IL-6 and hs-CRP as the sole indicators of inflammatory cytokines.",
            "Future studies should examine the relationship between work schedules and other inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and fibrinogen.",
            "Third, we did not consider about timing or days of measuring IL-6.",
            "Although we did not know the detailed time when Il-6 was measured, blood samples were collected at baseline during yearly health checkups and most participants had a scheduled health check during working hours.",
            "A meta-analysis confirmed that IL-6 varied across the day, the most conspicuous effect being a trough in the morning).",
            "Future study should consider diurnal fluctuation of IL-6.",
            "Fourth, both the quality and quantity of sleeping of participants were not completely understood, because the method used in J-HOPE did not include information about sleep deprivation.",
            "In addition, we did not know how long they had worked under night work.",
            "Future studies should evaluate the association between IL-6 and sleep deprivation in night shift workers.",
            "Fifth, we did not investigate the association between classical symptoms (i.e., chronic fatigue, stomach or duodenal ulcer) and inflammatory cytokines.",
            "Because the three classical symptoms were not investigated in the cohort study, this is an important area for future research.",
            "Sixth, we could not find the relationship between night shift work and CRP, as the reason might be attributable to under-detection of CRP levels.",
            "Lastly, the direct biological causal relationship between night shift work and IL-6 level remains unclear and warrants further investigation.",
            "Conclusion",
            "The present study revealed that working only night shifts was significantly related to high levels of IL-6 among Japanese workers.",
            "These observations can help us to understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between work schedule and CVD onset.",
            "Further studies are needed to assess the association between temporal variations in shift work and IL-6; additionally, interventions such as lifestyle changes should be considered."

            "Objectives",
            "The objective of this study was to develop an estimate of a radio frequency (RF) dose as the amount of mobile phone RF energy absorbed at the location of a brain tumour, for use in the Interphone Epidemiological Study.",
            "Methods",
            "We systematically evaluated and quantified all the main parameters thought to influence the amount of specific RF energy absorbed in the brain from mobile telephone use.",
            "For this, we identified the likely important determinants of RF specific energy absorption rate during protocol and questionnaire design, we collected information from study subjects, network operators and laboratories involved in specific energy absorption rate measurements and we studied potential modifiers of phone output through the use of software-modified phones.",
            "Data collected were analysed to assess the relative importance of the different factors, leading to the development of an algorithm to evaluate the total cumulative specific RF energy (in joules per kilogram), or dose, absorbed at a particular location in the brain.",
            "This algorithm was applied to Interphone Study subjects in five countries.",
            "Results",
            "The main determinants of total cumulative specific RF energy from mobile phones were communication system and frequency band, location in the brain and amount and duration of mobile phone use.",
            "Though there was substantial agreement between categorisation of subjects by cumulative specific RF energy and cumulative call time, misclassification was non-negligible, particularly at higher frequency bands.",
            "Factors such as adaptive power control (except in Code Division Multiple Access networks), discontinuous transmission and conditions of phone use were found to have a relatively minor influence on total cumulative specific RF energy.",
            "Conclusions",
            "While amount and duration of use are important determinants of RF dose in the brain, their impact can be substantially modified by communication system, frequency band and location in the brain.",
            "It is important to take these into account in analyses of risk of brain tumours from RF exposure from mobile phones.",
            "What this paper adds",
            "Epidemiological studies of brain tumours in relation to mobile phone use have mainly analysed risk in relation to amount and duration of use of mobile phones.",
            "While these factors are important determinants of the amount of radio frequency energy in the brain, our results suggest that their impact can be substantially modified by communication system, frequency band and tumour location.",
            "It is therefore important to take these into account in analyses of risk of brain tumours in relation to radio frequency exposure in Interphone and future case\u2013control and cohort studies.",
            "Introduction",
            "The multinational epidemiological study Interphone was conducted to evaluate the possible relationship between risk of brain, acoustic nerve and parotid gland tumours and radio frequency (RF) exposure from mobile phones.",
            "Most epidemiological papers to date have evaluated risk only in relation to reported mobile phone use.",
            "The relation between mobile phone use and RF dose (expressed as energy absorption) at the location of the tumour is complex, however, particularly since dose is localised.",
            "The Japanese Interphone Study developed dose indices taking localised absorption into account by multiplying phone duration by spatial maximum specific energy absorption rate (SAR) in the tumour region.",
            "SAR, in watts per kilogram, represents absorbed power per unit mass of tissue, a widely used metric of RF dose rate.",
            "Many parameters can, however, influence amount and distribution of RF dose in the brain, including telephone type, network characteristics, and amount and conditions of phone use.",
            "This paper presents an algorithm, developed within Interphone, to account for these parameters for dose estimation in epidemiological studies and illustrates its application on study subjects from five Interphone countries (Australia, Canada, France, Israel and New Zealand).",
            "Methods",
            "Interphone is a collaborative case\u2013control study conducted in 13 countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the UK).",
            "Study methods and results of analyses of brain tumour risk related to mobile phone use have been published.",
            "Subjects were interviewed using a questionnaire, including a mobile phone use calendar, structured according to factors that could change patterns of phone use and output power.",
            "Hundreds of pictures of mobile phones were compiled to assist subjects in identifying models used.",
            "Phone use for each subject was reported by period of use for each phone; if use changed, multiple periods were reported.",
            "For each period, questions were completed concerning network operator and duration and number of calls.",
            "Information on laterality, call environment and use of hands-free devices was collected.",
            "Information was also collected about Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) telephones.",
            "As use was limited among study subjects and because both peak and mean output are lower for mobile phones in the study, they were not included in the RF dose estimation.",

            "It was essential to determine whether brain radiation patterns differ between phones and, if so, to develop a method for assessing SAR distribution from different models.",
            "Computer simulations and experiments using phantoms (representing a head filled with homogeneous liquid) are the main dosimetric approaches used to produce an SAR distribution from a mobile phone, emitting in a specific frequency band, held in a specific position and radiating a specific power.",
            "Work involved is considerable, and it was not practical to conduct such detailed dosimetry for every phone model used.",
            "Results of SAR dosimetric measurements made in two broadly used standard phantoms (Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin and Generic Twin) were therefore analysed to derive 3D SAR distributions in the brain for mobile phones used by the study subjects and assign absolute levels of dose in the most exposed brain area.",
            "The approach, shown in online appendix figure 1, is detailed below.",
            "Identification of phone classes",
            "The aim was to identify phone classes producing distinct spatial distributions in the brain into which phones used historically by study subjects could be classified.",
            "Analyses of SAR spatial distribution were conducted using dosimetric databases from France and Japan on over 100 phone models from different countries and time periods, and clusters of SAR distributions were sought in relation to external phone features and communication system.",

            "A method was developed to estimate average SAR in each cube of the 1\u2005cm3 Gridmaster so that SAR at the location of each tumour could be derived (see for details).",
            "For each cube in the vicinity of the spatial peak, the finely sampled SAR measurements were averaged.",
            "The parameter of the exponential decay function inside the brain was estimated and average SAR in 1\u2005cm3 extrapolated to the entire Gridmaster.",

            "The relative average SAR value was computed in each Gridmaster cube as the ratio of its average SAR to the average in the cube with the highest SAR (generally located in the outer layer of the grid near the ear).",

            "Output power levels",
            "A mobile phone's RF emissions are directly proportional to its output power, which may vary substantially between different networks (depending on infrastructure at a given time, communication system, frequency band, enablement of different transmission protocols, such as DTX) and phone use circumstances (moving/stationary, urban/rural settings) due to power control technologies, such as APC.",
            "Determinants of output power were studied in volunteers in 12 countries who used GSM SMPs for approximately 1\u2005month each.",
            "Detailed methods and results have been published.",

            "The position in which phones are held varies between individuals and, for the same individual, during use and with different phones.",
            "Classifications of SAR distributions using phone position therefore cannot be used in epidemiological studies.",
            "Frequency is known to be inversely related to penetration depth of radiation.",
            "Phones were therefore classified by band as follows: 800\u2013900, 1500 and 1800\u20131900\u2005MHz.",
            "No measurement and limited simulations were available on 450\u2005MHz phones, and only 14 subjects in the five countries reported ever using them; they were therefore included with 800\u2013900\u2005MHz phones.",
            "Average spatial SAR distribution for each phone class",
            "From each phone measured, 3D SAR distributions were estimated in the Gridmaster and, for each phone class, the average SAR distribution was derived.",
            "Figure 2 shows average SAR distributions in the brain at 800\u2013900 and 1800\u2005MHz.",
            "Most of the SAR in the brain (97%\u201399% depending on frequency band) appeared to be absorbed in the hemisphere on the side where the phone is used, mainly (50%\u201360%) in the temporal lobe.",
            "The average relative SAR decreased rapidly with depth, particularly at higher frequencies (figure 2).",
            "The SAR distribution appeared similar across phone models, between older and newer phones, and between phones with different antenna types and positions.",
            "Output power levels",
            "Influence of APC",
            "In GSM phones, before APC was introduced in the early 1990s, phones worked to maximum power.",
            "The SMP study conducted between 2001 and 2005 with four GSM models, and over 63\u2008000 calls made by 516 subjects in 12 countries, showed that, on average, APC reduced power to around 50% of the maximum power levels in both 900 and 1800\u2005MHz frequency bands.",
            "Results from this and other studies are broadly consistent in the period 1999\u20132005 for GSM networks.",
            "For any historical dose index, however, extrapolation in time is necessary.",
            "GSM networks were introduced in early to mid-1990s in Europe and more recently in North America.",
            "Earlier, first-generation analogue networks had no or very limited APC capability (K Hansson Mild, personal communication, 2007), so phones were nearly always operating at maximum power.",
            "Since the start of GSM systems, improved network coverage may have reduced power levels, but increased indoor use of phones, more frequent use of handovers and higher traffic density may have increased them.",
            "Thus, there are uncertainties about backward extrapolation and we decided, for GSM and other second-generation networks, to assume a factor of 1 for APC up to its introduction and of 0.5 afterwards.",
            "For Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks, information about power control is scant, except that systems are very efficient.",
            "In a limited number of measurements in Canada, the average power was 13\u201315 times less than peak; an APC factor of 0.067 was therefore chosen for CDMA networks, compatible with recently published data comparing CDMA and GSM exposure levels.",
            "Influence of network operator",
            "The SMP study indicated important differences between operators.",
            "Within a frequency band, operator was the most important factor explaining differences in average power levels between users.",
            "The study, however, was only a snapshot in time and place, and network optimisation factors vary considerably over time and place.",
            "SMP volunteers moreover did not form a geographically representative sample of the study population in most countries, and no information was available for some networks in study regions.",
            "For these reasons, though this adds uncertainty, the dose algorithm could not include a factor relating to operator.",
            "Influence of phone use environment",
            "Urban/rural use",
            "A small (13%\u201314%) difference in average power levels was found in the SMP study between subjects using phones mainly in rural versus urban environments.",
            "This was mainly driven by Sweden, where volunteer selection covered sparsely populated areas.",
            "Few rural users were included in SMP studies elsewhere.",
            "Base-station data from Sweden showed greater urban/rural differences (factor of 1.6\u20131.9 depending on time of day), but data were for 1\u2005week and one operator only.",
            "An urban/rural factor was therefore included in the dose algorithm only where the study covered a large proportion of the country (Israel and New Zealand): based on SMP and base-station studies, average output power was estimated to be 30% greater in rural users than in urban users for second-generation phones.",
            "Use while moving or stationary",
            "No difference in average power levels was found in the SMP study between users using phones mainly while moving in a vehicle and those reporting mainly stationary use.",
            "This was initially surprising because networks must hand-over a moving phone from one base-station to another, and with each handover, the power returns to a high level before APC lowers output to optimum level.",
            "Handovers, however, occur frequently in stationary situations because networks need to distribute traffic equitably between base-stations, and stationary phone calls may require extra power in built-up areas because of shielding, thus explaining the lack of an effect.",
            "The SMP study, moreover, may not have been sufficiently sensitive to detect differences: information available concerned average use (the only information collectable in epidemiological studies) rather than use circumstance of each individual call.",
            "Based on the results of the SMP study, it was decided not to differentiate moving and stationary use in the dose algorithm.",
            "Indoor/outdoor",
            "A difference was found between output power inside and outside buildings in a small study.",
            "A question was added to the SMP study, but no difference was found.",
            "As no information is available in the Interphone questionnaire on use inside buildings, this variable was not included in the algorithm.",
            "This decision is unlikely to bias dose estimates because quality of indoor communications improved over time, leading to gradual increase of indoor use from a low level in the earliest years.",
            "However, this is a source of uncertainty.",
            "Influence of DTX",
            "Use of DTX could not be measured with the SMPs.",
            "Data published in 2000 suggest that DTX reduced average power by about 30% once it was enabled in a network.",
            "As little information was available from network operators about dates of DTX enablement and because operators which provided information reported it occurred early in GSM networks, it was assumed all GSM networks in the study were DTX enabled from 1994 to 1995.",
            "Use of phone-specific SAR values",
            "The dosimetry database of SARmax for phones in use before and during the Interphone Study included 1233 values.",
            "Analysis showed large variation in SAR, with some SARmax measured below 0.01\u2005W/kg (current limit of detection) possibly due to measurement errors.",
            "Analyses by time period (online appendix figure 3) provided no statistical evidence of a trend over time for a given communication system.",
            "The methods and standards used to measure SARmax have evolved over time, so SARmax values are not directly comparable.",
            "Analyses (not shown) of SARmax values for more recent models in the database, restricted to measurements in reputable laboratories, showed differences as high as a factor 3 for specific phone models.",
            "For these reasons and because efficiency of phones may partially compensate or exaggerate differences, phone-specific SARmax values were not used in the algorithm: instead, the median of available SARmax measurements was assigned to phones in a class.",
            "For this, SARmax measured with averaging volumes of 1 or 10\u2005g were converted to the SAR of the 1\u2005cm3 Gridmaster cell with the highest average SAR for the phone class.",
            "Conversion factors were derived from the database of SARmax (1\u2005g) and SARmax (10\u2005g) in the French and Japanese measurements.",
            "Single ratios were used for all frequency bands for SARmax (1\u2005g) and for SARmax (10\u2005g) as analyses showed no significant difference across bands (not shown).",
            "Information on phone use from study subjects",
            "Information on duration and number of calls was reported by Interphone Study subjects by period of use for each phone they had used.",
            "Information on laterality of use, call environment and use of hands-free devices was also collected.",
            "For time periods for which a subject reported use of hands-free devices, amount of use was reduced by 100%, 75%, 50% or 25%, respectively, if devices were used always or almost always, more than half, about half or less than half of the time.",
            "If the subject reported a preferred side of use, 90% of use was assigned to that side of the head and 10% to the other.",
            "Otherwise, 50% was assigned to each side of the head.",
            "Sensitivity analyses were also conducted in which reported laterality was not used at all, and 50% of use was assigned to each side for all subjects.",
            "Construction of the dose algorithm and application to Interphone Study subjects",
            "Based on the above, an algorithm was developed for RF dose from mobile phones in terms of cumulative specific energy (CSE) (in joules per kilogram) absorbed at a given location in the brain (l), for a given frequency band (f) (450, 800\u2013900, 1500, 1800\u20131900\u2005MHz) and a specific communication system (s) (GSM, CDMA, etc).",
            "Location can be anywhere within the Gridmaster cells, and the quantity estimated is the average within the volume of the relevant cells.",
            "The algorithm estimates the CSE (CSEl,f,s) absorbed at that location for a given study subject as follows:",
            "where:",
            "i denotes month of use within a period defined by operator and phone,",
            "X l,c proportion of the SARmax received at location l, for a phone in class c",
            "Averagec average over all phones in class c of the argument in parentheses",
            "SARx SARmax (1 or 10\u2005g) for phone x in class c from the SARmax measurements of phones.",
            "Conv1/10g conversion factor from SARmax measured for averaging volumes of 1 or 10\u2005g to SARmax in the Gridmaster cell with highest average SAR.",
            "Ti reported average call time in month i from answers to the questionnaire",
            "Hi modifier for reported use of hands-free devices in month i from the questionnaire (see above)",
            "Yi,u/r effect of exposure circumstances modifying output power (only urban/rural use\u2014see above)",
            "Pi,f,s o proportion of traffic in frequency f and communication system s for operator o at time i based on information from network operators questionnaires.",
            "Proportion is 1 if the phone operated in a single band and system.",
            "When dual bands/systems were enabled, the relative proportions of traffic were taken to increase linearly from 1.0/0.0 at time of introduction of the second frequency band/system to p/(1\u2212p)\u2014the proportions stated at time of response by the operator\u2014and to remain constant thereafter.",
            "Oi,f,s,o effect of other modifiers as appropriate (APC and DTX, see above).",
            "The total CSE absorbed at a given location (l) TCSEl for a particular study subject was obtained by summing over all combinations of communication systems and frequencies he/she used.",
            "Risk analyses can be conducted both using TCSEl as the explanatory variable (assuming that carrier frequencies and their modulation by different communication systems do not modify possible biological effects) and investigating separately the effect of CSE in different frequencies and communication systems.",
            "Based on this algorithm, other metrics can be developed including the time-weighted average of the absorbed power (TWA-SAR), obtained by dividing TCSE by total duration of calls, as well as TCSE and TWA-SAR in different time windows before case diagnosis to explore the hypotheses that risk, if any, may be related to dose rate rather than cumulative dose and that doses in different time windows may have different effects.",
            "Distribution of doses",
            "Table 1 and figure 3 show the resulting distribution of CSE at tumour location by communication system and frequency among glioma study subjects from the five countries (results for meningioma study subjects are similar\u2014not shown).",
            "Substantial differences were seen between technologies, with CSE being highest on average for Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) and lowest for GSM-1800 and CDMA systems.",
            "The distribution of TCSE at the tumour location by cumulative call time, cumulative number of calls and time since start of use of mobile phones is shown in table 2 overall (see online appendix table 2 for specific frequencies and communications systems).",
            "While substantial agreement (34%) exists between categorisation of subjects by TCSE and cumulative call time (\u03ba 0.68), there is non-negligible misclassification: 37%, 21% and 8% of subjects, respectively, have 1, 2 or more deciles of difference.",
            "Because higher frequencies penetrate less in the brain, the agreement is substantially lower for GSM-1800 (with 5% having complete agreement and 86% more than 2 deciles difference) than for lower frequencies (online appendix table 2).",
            "Results are similar for cumulative number of calls though \u03ba statistics, and agreement are lower.",
            "TCSE is also related to time since start of use (table 2 and online appendix table 2), with most subjects with high TCSE being long-term users and most short-term users having low TCSE.",
            "In analysis of variance including the main factors in the dose algorithm, only cumulative call time and tumour location were statistically significant predictors (predicting, respectively, 43% and 13% of the variability) for TCSE overall.",
            "Results were similar for analogue systems and 800\u2013900\u2005MHz frequency bands.",
            "For CDMA 1900, APC was statistically significantly associated with CSE (p=0.015).",
            "Discussion",
            "While attempts to take into account SAR spatial distribution have been made in epidemiological studies before, this is the first attempt to systematically evaluate and quantify the main parameters thought to influence RF dose from mobile telephone use in an epidemiological study.",
            "This work has necessitated identification of the likely important determinants of SAR, and collection of appropriate information from study subjects, network operators and laboratories involved in SAR measurements to evaluate the importance of each factor.",
            "It also necessitated the development of SMPs and the conduct of volunteer studies using these phones.",
            "The main determinants of TCSE from mobile phones were found to be communication system and frequency band, tumour location and amount and duration of mobile phone use.",
            "Factors such as APC (except in CDMA networks where its influence is substantial), DTX, urban/rural, moving/stationary and indoor/outdoor use were found to have a relatively minor influence.",
            "Although TCSE and cumulative call time agree substantially in categorising RF exposures, using only the reported call time creates a complicated mixture of Berkson and classical measurement errors, particularly at higher frequencies and in CDMA networks.",
            "If RF dose is truly associated with brain tumour risk, these exposure assessment errors could bias risk estimates towards the null (no effect) and increase their uncertainty, making it more likely that real associations with RF dose would not be detected in case\u2013control and cohort studies.",
            "Efforts to take into account main determinants of dose are therefore important.",
            "Uncertainties in spatial SAR distribution for each phone class, particularly in relation to possible differences within classes.",
            "This study found clustering of phones related to external phone characteristics only in specific phone positions.",
            "As this varies during normal use, it cannot be used to define phone classes, but regrouping of phones may cause some misclassification.",
            "Difficulties in localising the probable centre of the tumour.",
            "A protocol for localisation was developed and tested by a panel of neuroradiologists.",
            "In most cases, neuroradiologists reported high confidence in their evaluation.",
            "In some instances, however, particularly when images were not available for localisation, only tumour location was entered into the Gridmaster.",
            "The centre was then estimated with a specially developed computer program to find the tumour's centre of gravity (except for meningioma located at the surface of the meninges, close to the skull, for which the centre was estimated as the geometric centre of gravity of the outermost layer of the tumour).",
            "Comparison of centres predicted in this way with tumour centres estimated by neuroradiologist showed good agreement.",
            "Lack of reliable systematic information on SARmax and phone efficiency for specific phones used by study subjects and lack of information on parameters influencing APC for specific networks in the study.",
            "Average information therefore had to be used, adding uncertainty to the dose estimation.",
            "Potential error in recall of phone use: Interphone validation studies indicated that recall was subject to moderate systematic but substantial random error.",
            "Systematic errors were larger for duration of calls than number of calls, and phone use was underestimated by light users and overestimated by heavy users.",
            "There was little evidence overall that error was different between cases and controls overall, though cases appeared to over-report for more distant time periods.",
            "Potential error in laterality of use.",
            "Little direct data exist on laterality recall errors, and impact of potential recall biases on risk estimates has been the topic of debate.",
            "Since laterality is one of the components of our algorithm, risk estimates can be derived with or without it, thereby shedding some light on this important question.",
            "Pulsed low-frequency magnetic fields from digital phones.",
            "DC electricity flowing from the phone's battery with each pulsed data transmission generates magnetic fields (online appendix figure 4).",
            "For GSM phones, these 217\u2005Hz pulses have frequency components in the extremely low-frequency range, where brain cancer risks have been inconsistently associated with occupational exposures.",
            "Interphone investigated the feasibility of estimating exposure to pulsed magnetic field emissions, but this was beyond the study's resources.",
            "Pilot measurements made on SMPs (online appendix 2) demonstrated that CSE and cumulative exposures to pulsed magnetic fields have many of the same determinants (online appendix figures 4\u20135).",
            "Therefore, the cumulative magnitude of pulsed magnetic fields from digital mobile phones may be confounded with TCSE in epidemiological studies.",
            "Lack of knowledge regarding the biologically relevant dose metric.",
            "Although correct specification of dose metric can have a major impact on a study's power, laboratory studies of effects of non-thermal RF exposures provide little guidance on biophysical mechanisms, if any, and relevant dose metric for RF epidemiology.",
            "Cumulative dose is a biologically valid dose measure for many carcinogenic agents, such as ionising radiation, and was therefore used as the main metric in our study, though other metrics such as dose rate and cumulative electric field strength can also be derived from our algorithm.",
            "There are a number of uncertainties in our estimation of dose, which will need to be investigated further:",
            "Conclusions",
            "While substantial agreement was found between categorisation of subjects by TCSE and cumulative call time, there was non-negligible misclassification, related to communication system and tumour location, particularly at higher frequency bands.",
            "While this is important for Interphone, it will be particularly important in future epidemiological studies in which a greater proportion of subjects will have used higher 1500, 1800\u20131900, 2200\u2005MHz frequency bands and communication systems with more efficient power control like CDMA and UMTS.",
            "Efforts to investigate different dose metrics and to quantify the uncertainties described above in future, more detailed studies are needed to improve dose estimation and reduce uncertainty in case\u2013control and cohort studies of brain tumours and RF exposure from mobile telephones."

            "Introduction",
            "Experimentally, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), widely used as a plasticizer for synthetic polymers, is known to induce testicular atrophy with hepatomegaly in mice and rats [1,2].",
            "After oral exposure, most DEHP is rapidly metabolized in the gut into mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the active metabolite inducing testicular atrophy [1].",
            "Many biochemical studies have shown that the concentrations of testosterone, zinc, ascorbic acid and glutathione are decreased in both testes and sera of DEHP-treated animals [3,4].",
            "However, the details of mechanisms of the spermatogenic disturbance caused by DEHP remain unclear.",
            "There is speculation that the production of free-radicals might injure the seminiferous epithelium in DEHP-treated animals.",
            "Actually, Kasahara et al. [4]",
            "recently showed that oral administration of DEHP http://www.asiaandro.com; aja@sibs.ac.cn increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (O2-and H2O2) with concomitant decreases in glutathione and ascorbic acid in the rat testes.",
            "Nitric oxide (NO) is also a free radical, and is a potential biological mediator that functions at low concentration as a signal in many diverse physiological processes, but it might cause DNA damage and cell death at high concentration [5,6].",
            "However, so far there has been no report on nitrogen oxides (NOx) in DEHP-treated animals.",
            "Our previous study showed that feeding mice with diets containing 2% DEHP induced focal degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium from day 5 and depletion of almost all germ cells by day 15 [7].",
            "The aim of the present study is to compare the NOx generation, the MEHP distribution and lipid peroxidation in the testis with those in the liver, kidney and pancreas in 2% DEHP-treated mice.",

            "Animals",
            "Male Crlj:CD1(ICR) mice (6-week old) were purchased from Charles River (Kanagawa, Japan) and kept in the Laboratory Animal Center of Tokyo Medical University for 1 week.",

            "A normal CE-2 diet was purchased from Clea (Tokyo, Japan), and CE-2 diet containing 2% DEHP was prepared by Oriental Yeast Company (Chiba, Japan).",
            "We used a diet of 2% DEHP because our previous study showed that the diet containing 2%, instead of 1% DEHP, induced significant aspermatogenesis in rats when given for 2 weeks [8].",
            "Experimental design",
            "Seven-week-old male ICR mice were divided into control (n = 5) and DEHP-treated groups (n = 7).",

            "The dose of DEHP was 0.90 \u00b1 0.52 mg/mouse/day.",
            "On day 10, all mice were deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether, and then blood was taken from the right atrium.",
            "Thereafter, the testis, liver, kidney and pancreas of each mouse were weighed.",

            "Results",
            "DEHP-treated mice had mild diarrhea for 10 days, and their bodyweights were significantly decreased (Table 1).",
            "The relative liver weights of DEHP-treated mice were significantly higher than those of control mice, showing the presence of hepatomegaly (Figure 1).",
            "The relative testis weights of DEHP-treated mice were not significantly changed from those of the controls, neither were the kidney or pancreas weights.",
            "However, histologically, it was noted that most germ cells had been deleted from the seminiferous epithelium with much fluid in the tubules of the all DEHP-treated mice (Figure 2).",
            "Histochemically, lipid peroxidation was    detected in the testis but not liver, kidneys or pancreas of all DEHP-treated mice (Figure 2).",
            "Serum analyses showed a significant decrease in testosterone, indicating the presence of Leydig cell dysfunction.",
            "It was also found that total protein, BUN, Na, ALP and GPT in DEHP-treated mice had been increased, indicating the presence of dehydration and hepatic insufficiency (Figure 3).",
            "The BUN / CRE ratios in control and DEHP-treated mice were 83.6 \u00b1 3.8 (mean \u00b1 SE, n = 5) and 89.0 \u00b1 8.6 (mean \u00b1 SE, n = 7), respectively (P < 0.6).",
            "Therefore, renal insufficiency was not apparent in DEHP-treated mice.",
            "As expected, MEHP was specifically accumulated in the livers of DEHP-treated mice (Figure 4).",
            "It was noted that the MEHP concentration in their kidneys was as high as that in their livers, despite no significant induction of renal failure.",
            "In sharp contrast, the MEHP concentration in their injured testes was found to be extremely low.",
            "The NOx concentration in livers was significantly higher than that in kidneys or pancreata in DEHP-treated mice (Figure 4).",
            "However, the testicular NOx concentration did not significantly differ from that in the liver, although the testes contained only a small amount of MEHP.",
            "The testicular concentrations of Zn, Fe and Cu in DEHPtreated mice were 9.27 \u00b1 0.73 \u03bcg/g, 15.47 \u00b1 0.84 \u03bcg/g and 1.31 \u00b1 0.12 \u03bcg/g, respectively.",
            "These were lower than those in control testes, but the differences between control and experimental groups were not significant (P > 0.05,  http://www.asiaandro.com; aja@sibs.ac.cn Figure 5).",
            "Discussion",
            "In the present study, we showed that the concentration of MEHP in the testes of DEHP-treated mice was significantly lower than that in the liver, however, the quantity of the testicular NOx was as high as hepatic NOx.",
            "Furthermore, free radical-induced lipid peroxidation could be histochemically detected only in the testes among the four examined organs.",
            "These results suggest that DEHP-induced aspermatogenesis might due to the high sensitivity of the testicular tissues to MEHP instead of specific accumulation or uptake of MEHP into the testis.",
            "In the serum analyses, the concentration of testosterone was found to significantly decreased in DEHP-treated mice, indicating the presence of Leydig cell dysfunction.",
            "Furthermore, liver dysfunction with increased GPT and ALP concentrations was detected in the treated mice.",
            "These findings were consistent with results of previous studies [4].",
            "It was also noted during the BUN/CRE analysis that no apparent renal dysfunction was induced in spite of the high MEHP concentration in the kidneys of DEHP-treated mice.",
            "In contrast, the amount of the testicular MEHP was found to be extremely low compared with that in other organs examined, although the MEHPtoxicity had been exerted on a number of cells including Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and germ cells [14].",
            "This indicates that the testicular cells have a quite high sensitivity to MEHP.",
            "To our knowledge, there has only been one previous study on free radical production in DEHP-treated animals, which showed the increased production of reactive oxygens (O2-and H2O2) in the rat testes, but no other organs were examined [4].",
            "In the present study, we compared NOx generation in testes with that in livers, kidneys and pancreata.",
            "The analysis showed that testicular NOx was as high as hepatic NOx.",
            "Therefore, NOx generation and the MEHP distribution were not correlated with each other among the four examined organs.",
            "Additionally, we measured the testicular amounts of Fe, Cu and Zn, the important components of antioxidant enzymes such as Cu/Zn-SOD, Fe-SOD, Fe/Zn-SOD and catalase (Fe-catalase).",
            "These three elements were found to be slightly, but not significantly, decreased in DEHPtreated mice.",
            "Interestingly, a previous study showed that the activities of Cu/Zn-SOD and catalase were sig-nificantly increased in DEHP-treated testes [4].",
            "It was also noted in another study that the Zn concentration was significantly decreased, whereas the activity of Zncontaining enzymes (alcohol dehydrogenase and aldolase) was increased in the testes of DEHP-treated rats [2].",
            "Therefore, it is likely that Zn-related enzymes, including SOD, are activated by DEHP exposure to a certain degree in the testis, although the total amount of Zn in the organ is decreased.",
            "With regard to the nonenzymatic antioxidant system, it was shown that DEHP administration decreases glutathione, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and vitamin E in rat testes [4,15].",
            "Actually, our previous study showed that the administration of vitamins C and E is effective for the prevention and treatment of DEHP-induced aspermatogenesis [7,8].",
            "It was also reported that antioxidant vitamins protect spermatogenesis from other toxic agents [16].",
            "In contrast to antioxidant vitamins, the administration of Zn had failed to protect the testes from DEHP-induced injury [17].",
            "This indicates that the testicular toxicity of DEHP is the result of the generation of free radicals rather than depletion of Zn in the testes.",
            "In regard to the effect of administration of testosterone on DEHPtreated animals, there are two studies: one showed the protection of spermatogenesis by testosterone [18], but the other displayed no significant effect on the spermatogenic disturbance [19].",
            "Inoue et al. [20] reported that mild oxidative stress to the result of a nephrotoxic agent induced free radical generation accompanied by an increase in the hepatorenal glutathione levels in rats.",
            "It was also noted that DEHP administration significantly increased the glutathione concentration in both livers and kidneys but decreased it in the testis [4].",
            "Therefore, it could be the high sensitivity of testicular tissues to DEHP that partially causes the lowered glutathione levels in testes.",
            "In contrast, the antioxidant hepatorenal glutathione activity might be relatively resistant to DEHP exposure.",
            "Experimental supplementation of glutathione is now in progress to determine whether it is useful for the prevention or curation of DEHP-induced aspermatogenesis.",

            "We present here data on cancer development in transplanted subject who received organs from donors whose DNA was previously examined for the genomic insertion of SV40.",
            "MATERIALS AND METHODS",
            "In all, 134 solid organ donors were identified through a previous study conducted between 2002 and 2004 within the North Italian Transplant Reference Center of the Policlinico Hospital of Milano, Italy, with the aim of assessing the prevalence of SV40 genomic infection.",
            "None of the donors were clinically affected by cancer at the time of organ donation.",
            "Briefly, DNA was isolated from blood samples from organ donors, and PCR reactions were performed in order to determine the presence of SV40 sequences in the donors' DNA.",
            "Negative and positive controls were included in all sets of reactions.",
            "The pBRSV (ATCC 45019, from G Khoury) plasmid, containing the entire genome of the reference strain SV40\u2013776, was used as the positive control in PCR amplification.",
            "Special precautions were taken in order to avoid laboratory contamination with SV40 sequences.",
            "The analysis was repeated in a blind fashion, in order to confirm the results.",
            "DNA from samples that were positive for SV40 by PCR were sequenced twice in both directions using specific primers according to the manufacturer's protocol (ABI PRISM\u00ae Big Dye TM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).",
            "The organs deriving from these donors were distributed to different transplant centers in Italy (Bergamo, Bologna, Brescia, Genova, Milan, Modena, Padova, Palermo, Pavia, Pisa, Roma, Torino, Treviso, Udine, Varese, Vicenza, Verona).",
            "Informed consent for organ donation and evaluation of organ safety, as required by Italian law, was obtained from family members at the time of organ donation.",
            "The Hospital Ethical Committee approved the program of solid organ donation.",
            "The follow-up of the recipients was performed through the National Transplant Center (NTC), part of the Superior Institute of Health.",
            "This Institute was created in March 2000 with the purpose of coordinating the activity of all the centres operating in the transplant system, and to assure the monitoring of transplant quality.",
            "The NTC conducts a yearly follow-up of the vital status of all the solid organ transplanted subjects in Italy, and among the other information, collects data on cancer incidence.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "Arithmetic means and s.d. of the demographic variables were calculated.",
            "Patients' survival was calculated using the actuarial method (Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis).",
            "Each patient in the cohort was included in the analysis and counted from the date of transplant to the date of cancer development, or death or loss at follow-up.",
            "The expected number of cancer cases in subjects who received organs from SV40 positive donors was calculated by applying cancer incidence rates observed among recipients of organs from SV40 negative donors.",
            "The Monte Carlo \u03c72 was used to test if a significant difference existed between observed and expected number of cancer cases.",
            "All the statistical analyses were performed using the SAS statistical package (version 8, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).",
            "RESULTS",
            "Out of 134 proposed donors, 120 were actually utilised for organ donation.",
            "Of these, 12 (10%) were subsequently classified as positive for SV40 genomic insertion.",
            "None of the positive samples showed sequence homology with either JCV or BKV sequences.",
            "The 120 utilised donors were Caucasians, 56.7% males, with an average age at organ donation of 48\u00b116 years (range 21\u201378 years), and gave 408 solid organs (kidney, heart, pancreas, liver and lung) to 387 different recipients (Table 1).",
            "The average length of follow-up after transplant was 671\u00b1219 days (range 0\u20131085 days).",
            "Out of 387 transplant recipients, we obtained follow-up information on 364 subjects (94.1%).",
            "The missing information refer to 21 subjects from a transplant centre which preferred not to furnish follow-up data, and to two subjects whose organs were given to the European transplant organisation, and therefore where not followed-up by the NTC.",
            "Out of the 364 transplanted subjects, 11 developed cancer (3.0%): five after kidney transplant (three male subjects and two female subjects), five after liver transplant (four male subjects and one female subjects), and one after heart transplant (a male subject).",
            "The average actuarial incidence of cancer was 0.015 per year.",
            "The 12 subjects subsequently identified as SV40 positive donors donated 43 organs to 41 recipients (Table 2).",
            "None of these recipients developed cancer during the follow-up period (average follow-up 671\u00b1266 days).",
            "The remaining 108 donors who were subsequently identified as SV40 negative gave 365 organs to 346 recipients (Table 2).",
            "In all 11 of these recipients developed cancer during the follow-up period (667\u00b1219 days).",
            "The 11 patients who developed cancer received organs from 11 different donors (Table 2).",
            "These donors also donated other 35 organs, but none of the recipients developed cancer.",
            "The expected number of cases among recipient of organs from positive donors was 1 per year, for a total of two expected cases during the whole follow-up period; however, no subject who received organs from SV40 positive donors developed a tumour (Monte Carlo \u03c72=2.05; P<0.001).",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "Simian Virus 40 DNA infection has been detected in several but not all human tumour types.",
            "The lack of consistency of the results may reflect the type of tumours examined, the age of the patients, the analytical methods used to detect genomic SV40 infection, or possible laboratory contamination.",
            "The summary of published studies on the association between SV40 and cancer suggests that, even if the virus may be an important co-factor in cancer development, its aetiological role is not yet proven, and the time needed for completing the carcinogenesis process is not known for SV40.",
            "A further consideration is that SV40 DNA has been found in tumour cells, but it has also been detected in peripheral blood of otherwise healthy subjects.",
            "Although SV40 has been shown to be tumorigenic in animal models, no appropriate comparable model has been developed in human subjects to study SV40 carcinogenicity.",
            "We are using a unique approach, in which the SV40 genomic status of the donors before transplant is known, and is correlated with the follow-up of the recipient for cancer development.",
            "As the information on SV40 genomic infection status of the donors was available a priori, it was possible to know which recipient was directly exposed to the infection after transplant.",
            "Only a few studies have examined SV40 infection in transplanted patients, but nobody has studied cancer development in relation to SV40 infection in these patients.",
            "Among the strengths of this study is the fact that the population of transplanted patients is part of a highly controlled system of follow-up, set up at a national level, which allowed an almost complete follow-up of the subjects (over 94%).",
            "Moreover, all the donors were clinically free of cancer at the time of donation, and they were tested for the presence of SV40.",
            "One of the limitations of the study could be the short follow-up period.",
            "In a previous study conducted in Italy on the incidence of cancer after kidney transplant, the average time to cancer development after transplant was 1200 days, while the average follow-up in this study is 670 days.",
            "However, Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are more likely generated by patient viral reactivation or viral transmission from the donor to recipients, and such tumours require less time to develop than solid organ tumours.",
            "Viral infection from Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) or HHV8, for example, was associated with PTLDs or KS, with incidences that were maximal during the first year after transplant.",
            "However, since the latent period for SV40 carcinogenesis is not known, the length of follow-up necessary to assess a risk of cancer related to SV40 genomic infection in these patients remains a theoretical question.",
            "Repeated yearly follow-ups of these patients are ongoing.",
            "This study examined the presence of genomic insertion of SV40 in transplant recipients' DNA, in order to avoid the cross reactivity to antibodies to the common human JC and BK viruses, therefore, we have no data on carcinogenicity related to these viruses.",
            "Testing for the presence of genomic insertion of these viruses and cancer development could be valuable in future studies.",
            "Cancer rates observed in our study are comparable to that reported in the literature in transplanted patients.",
            "The application of the expected cancer incidence rates (observed among recipients of organs from SV40 negative donors) to the subjects who received organs from SV40 positive donors should yield an expected number of cases around 1 per year, for a total of two expected cases during the whole follow-up period.",
            "Our data show that no subject who received organs from SV40 positive donors developed a tumour, thus the results show less than the expected incidence.",
            "Although this result does not indicate any protective effect of SV40, it is certainly consistent with a lack of carcinogenic activity of the virus in organ-transplanted subjects.",
            "As the genomic presence of SV40 in the recipients was not tested, it could be possible that some of the subjects who developed a tumour were SV40 positive independently from the donor status.",
            "However, even if some of the recipients were SV40 positive, the fact that they did not develop any tumour during the follow-up strengthens our results.",
            "Therefore, knowing the SV40 infective status of the recipients would not decrease the strength of the result observed in the recipients of organs from positive donors, none of whom developed cancer.",
            "In conclusion, SV40 positive donors do not seem to increase the risk of cancer after transplantation."

            "In previous analyses we have shown that parental occupational exposure to diesel exhaust may increase the risk of CBT; maternal exposure to diesel exhaust any time before birth showed an OR of 1.77 (95% CI 0.96\u20133.26), whereas paternal exposure around the time of the child's conception showed an OR of 1.39 (95% CI 0.97\u20131.99).",

            "We assessed the following subtypes of solvents: benzene, other aromatics, aliphatics and chlorinated solvents.",
            "For the different exposures, different numbers of questions were selected: benzene was based on 16 questions from 14 job modules; other aromatic solvents based on 31 questions from 16 modules; aliphatic solvents based on 30 questions from 16 modules; and chlorinated solvents based on 20 questions from 11 modules.",
            "The a priori exposure rules were then applied to the information collected in the telephone interviews with the parents.",
            "Exposure was assigned blinded to the case\u2013control status.",
            "Exposure variables were created for specific time periods relative to the birth year of the child.",
            "These key time periods were exposure at any time before the child's birth year; exposure in the year 2 years before the birth year (capturing \u2018the year before conception' for fathers only); exposure in the year before the child's birth year (capturing the time during pregnancy for mothers); and exposure in the year after the child's birth year (representing the time of breast feeding \u2013 mothers only).",
            "Statistical analyses",
            "ORs and 95% CIs were estimated for maternal and paternal occupational exposures to solvents associated with risk of CBT in their offspring, using unconditional logistic regression models.",
            "All models were adjusted for the frequency-matching variables.",
            "Models were additionally adjusted for best parental education (as a measure of socio-economic status (SES)) and occupational exposure to diesel exhaust.",
            "Other potential confounders that were considered, based on their suggested association with CBTs and potential association with occupational exposure to solvents, were any maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, any maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal age at child's birth and paternal alcohol use in the year prior to pregnancy.",
            "The addition of these variables changed the ORs by <5%, so they were not included in the final models.",
            "We have also included occupational exposures to benzene, other aromatics, aliphatics, chlorinated solvents and diesel exhaust in one model (OR2).",

            "To reach our frequency-matching quotas, 1467 of these families were recruited to the study.",
            "Full occupational information was provided by 935 control mothers (63.7% of recruited) and 795 fathers (54.2%).",
            "Overall, occupational information of at least one of the parents was available for 306 cases and 950 controls.",
            "These families were included in the analyses (Table 1).",
            "Maternal exposure to all solvents combined any time before birth of their child suggested an increased risk of CBT, showing an OR of 1.16, but with a wide CI (Table 2).",
            "When analyses were specified to type of solvent, the increased risk was most pronounced with maternal occupational exposure to chlorinated solvents (OR 8.79, 95% CI 0.96\u201380.7) at any time before birth.",
            "Overall, few women were exposed to solvents in the year before birth (Table 2) or in the year after birth (data not shown).",
            "Paternal occupational exposure to all solvents combined any time before the child's birth appeared to be associated with CBT risk: OR 1.27 (95% CI 0.90\u20131.79, Table 3).",
            "The OR for paternal exposure in the year before conception was 1.55 (95% CI 0.99\u20132.43).",
            "Risk of CBT seemed to be increased with paternal occupational exposure in the year before conception to benzene (OR 2.66, 95% CI 0.92\u20137.69), other aromatics (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10\u20132.79) and aliphatics (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.90\u20132.24) (Table 3).",
            "The OR for exposure to chlorinated solvents was also elevated (2.33), but, being based on very small numbers exposed, the CI was wide.",
            "Exposures to other aromatic solvents and aliphatic solvents were strongly correlated among men (RPearson=0.90).",
            "When both exposures in the year before conception were included in the same model and adjusted for diesel exhaust exposure, only exposure to other aromatic solvents (OR 4.24, 95% CI 1.10\u201316.4) was associated with an increased risk of CBT (the OR for aliphatic solvents was 0.39, 95% CI 0.10\u20131.49) (data not shown).",
            "When all exposures were modelled together, the association between CBT risk and paternal exposure to other aromatics appeared to be strongest (OR2 4.47, 95% CI 1.12\u201317.8; Table 3).",
            "Excluding the Aus-ALL controls from the analyses revealed similar risk estimates (data not shown).",
            "When both parents had occupational exposure to solvents any time before the child's birth, the OR for CBT was 2.04 (95% CI 0.90\u20134.64, based on 25 exposed controls and 13 exposed cases), compared with the non-exposed case (data not shown).",
            "Discussion",
            "Our results suggest that parental occupational exposure to solvents is associated with an increased risk of CBT.",
            "For paternal exposure, this seemed mainly driven by exposure to aromatic solvents in the year before conception.",
            "For mothers, a positive association, although based on very small numbers exposed, was observed between CBT risk and exposure to chlorinated solvents any time before the child's birth.",
            "Our overall findings are consistent with previous reports on the association of CBT with parental exposure to solvents.",
            "We observed an OR of 1.16 (95% CI 0.71\u20131.90) for combined solvent exposure any time before birth for mothers.",
            "This risk estimate is lower than the OR of 2.4 (95% CI 1.2\u20134.9) reported by for occupational exposure in the 5-year period before the child's birth.",
            "This OR of 2.4 reflected the risk for the highest exposure category.",
            "For any exposure, the OR for mothers in their study was 1.3 (95% CI 0.9\u20132.0).",
            "However, we additionally adjusted for occupational exposure to diesel exhaust, whereas without this adjustment the OR for maternal exposure would have been 1.32 (95% CI 0.85\u20132.06; data not shown).",
            "For paternal exposure to combined solvents Cordier et al did not observe an increased risk, while we found an OR of 1.27 (95% CI 0.90\u20131.79) any time before birth and an OR of 1.55 (95% CI 0.99\u20132.43) for exposure in the year before conception.",
            "Such an increased risk of CBT associated with paternal exposure to solvents was also found in an earlier study.",
            "None of the earlier studies considered the risks by specific type of solvents.",
            "In the model where all solvents and diesel exhaust were mutually adjusted (OR2), the evidence was strongest for an association of CBT with exposure of fathers to aromatic solvents.",
            "The association with occupational exposure to diesel exhaust reported previously attenuated when modelled together with the specific solvent exposures (OR2).",
            "When testing for interactions between exposure to diesel exhaust and solvents, we observed a significant interaction (P=0.049) for paternal exposure in the year before conception.",
            "Stratified analyses of the association between paternal occupational exposure to solvents in the year before conception and the risk of CBT revealed an OR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.54\u20131.99) among fathers not occupationally exposed to diesel exhaust in that year and an OR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.23\u20134.98) among fathers who were occupationally exposed to diesel exhaust in the same period (data not shown).",
            "No interactions were observed for paternal or maternal exposures any time before birth.",
            "The timing of parental exposure relative to the child's birth can give a clue to the most biologically relevant period of exposure: preconceptional exposure (germ cell effect), perinatal exposure (i.e. intra-uterine or trans-placental) or postnatal exposure (via breast feeding).",
            "The detailed job histories obtained from both parents allowed us to assess occupational exposures for the potentially relevant time periods.",
            "However, numbers of exposed mothers were generally too low to specify time periods.",
            "While we did observe an increased risk for maternal exposure to chlorinated solvents any time before birth, this was based on only three exposed case mothers and four exposed control mothers.",
            "None of the mothers was exposed to chlorinated solvents in the year of the pregnancy.",
            "For paternal exposure, the year before conception appeared to have the largest impact as all those ORs were higher than the ORs for any time before birth.",
            "This finding suggests a potential effect on sperm cells.",
            "Exposure to aromatic solvents such as toluene and xylene showed the strongest relation with CBT in our population.",
            "Toluene has been causally linked to DNA damage in the sperm of rats, which could potentially lead to carcinogenic effects in the offspring.",
            "The use of organic solvents in Australia and many other developed economies is widespread, including in paints and lacquers, dry cleaning, printing and degreasing.",
            "It is recommended that exposures be kept as low as workable and many solvents have occupational exposure standards (e.g. for toluene the 8-h TWA is 50 p.p.m. and the short-term exposure limit is 150 p.p.m. in Australia).",
            "The median birth year of the children in the current study was 2001 (range 1990\u20132010), so the relevant paternal exposures in the years before conception will largely have been below this limit.",
            "The current use of halogenated solvents should be lower than in previous decades because Australia ratified the Montreal protocol and committed to phasing out the industrial use of particular solvents (e.g. carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform) by the end of 1995 and specific uses (e.g. methyl bromide in horticulture) by the end of 2005.",
            "The Australian government committed to a 90% reduction in the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons by 2015 and complete phasing out by 2020.",
            "Control families were recruited by national random-digit dialling.",
            "Approximately 90% of Australian households had a landline telephone connection during the recruitment period, so families contacted were likely to be representative of the wider population.",
            "The participation rates in our study were relatively low, however, among both the cases and the controls.",
            "Subjects of highest SES are more likely to participate in a study than subjects of lower SES when recruitment is done via random-digit dialling.",
            "Previous analyses have shown that the control families used in our study were of higher SES than the general population.",
            "We aimed to minimise selection bias by adjusting for SES by means of the highest level of education completed by one of the parents.",
            "Adjustment for parental education resulted in slightly lower risk estimates overall, both for paternal and for maternal occupational exposure to solvents, when compared to models not adjusted for education.",
            "Recall bias may have influenced the results, as case parents may reflect on and recall past exposures more than control parents, thus biasing the risk estimates upwards.",
            "This bias would be particularly likely when questions are asked about specific, known-toxic exposures.",
            "We did not ask direct questions about exposure, rather we sought information on jobs and tasks and assigned specific exposures using pre-defined rules.",
            "We cannot rule out, however, greater reporting of jobs or tasks based on case parents' perceptions of hazards that might be associated with them.",
            "ORs may be strongly affected by small changes in the probability of false-positive exposure classifications (i.e. being classified as being exposed when truly non-exposed) when studying low prevalence exposures.",
            "When comparing the rule-based exposure assessment method with the more conventional case-by-case expert assessment, it appeared that the assessment of exposure to solvents showed less agreement than pesticides and diesel exhaust, although agreement was still moderate to good for solvents.",
            "Chlorinated solvents showed the lowest agreement (\u03ba=0.26 for men and \u03ba=0.46 for women on a job level), indicating that these solvents are particularly difficult to assess.",
            "It is likely that exposure misclassification will have occurred, but without a gold standard we can neither define the specificity of the method nor state whether we under- or overestimated the true exposures.",
            "Exposure misclassification may result in spurious risk estimates; it may therefore be worthwhile applying a more detailed exposure assessment method taking into account exposure levels.",
            "In the previous Aus-ALL study, levels of exposure have been studied by applying case-by-case expert assessment.",
            "The same approach could be applied to the Aus-CBT study population, focusing on the specific exposures that appeared to be associated with an increased CBT risk.",
            "Additionally, larger study populations may be beneficial when studying a rare disease like CBT in more detail.",
            "Pooled analyses of CBT case\u2013control studies where full job histories have been collected may improve our understanding of the effect of occupational exposures on the risk of CBT and its subtypes.",
            "Our results suggest that parental occupational exposures to solvents may be related to CBT.",
            "In particular, paternal exposure to aromatic solvents and maternal exposure to chlorinated solvents appeared to be associated with an increased risk of CBT in their offspring."

            "This study aimed to preliminarily investigate whether these biomarkers could be objective indicators for fatigue and stress among working women.",
            "Method:",
            "Participants included 118 full-time female workers (mean age 37.8 years), including 55 shift workers.",
            "Self-administered questionnaires, such as visual analog scale (VAS) for general health, a lifestyle questionnaire, SF-8 for health-related quality of life, and K6 for mental health screening, were used.",

            "Our results suggest that APG and BAP are potential objective biomarkers for fatigue among working women, although further follow-up studies are needed to clarify the scope of usefulness of the biomarkers for fatigue.",
            "Introduction",
            "In Japan, the law \"promotion for activity of women on work life\" (Woman Activity Promotion Law) was established in November 2015.",
            "Japanese women are influenced by various external environmental factors such as housework and child care, in addition to social labor.",
            "Furthermore, internal environmental factors, such as dramatic changes in sex hormones, could lead to alterations in their physical and mental states.",
            "Thus, work-related fatigue and stress among working women is complicated due to the added work related to housekeeping.",
            "As a current counterplan against \"Karoshi,\" fatigue is subjectively estimated using an \"occupational workplace stress simple questionnaire.\"",
            "However, fatigue is considered to be related not only to recognized symptoms but also to unrecognized physical reactions.",
            "Fatigue is a unique discomfort and a decline in the state of physical activity for ability with the desire to rest because of excessive physical and mental activities or illness.",
            "Although \"fatigue\" and the \"sensation of fatigue\" are considered to be the same, the conception of \"fatigue\" is distinguished from the \"sensation of fatigue.\"",
            "\"Fatigue\" means a decrease in physical ability for activity that occurs due to an overload to mind and body, and \"sensation of fatigue\" is the sense of noticing that fatigue exists, with discomfort and a decrease in activity being recognized.",
            "Therefore, objective biomarkers are required for the precise evaluation of fatigue.",
            "Recent studies on fatigue have reported that autonomic nerve balance and oxidative stress makers in serum can potentially estimate mental and physical fatigue,.",
            "Guidelines for fatigue evaluation have recently been published by the Japanese Society of Fatigue Science.",
            "These guidelines established methods for objectively evaluating fatigue as well as to measure biomarkers, medications, or services for combating fatigue.",
            "More recently, Fukuda et al. reported that oxidative stress and anti-oxidative activity were potential biomarkers for fatigue in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.",
            "Oxidative stress and anti-oxidative activity are associated with a risk of atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease,.",
            "Thus, we hypothesized that biomarkers of autonomic function and oxidative stress are potential objective indicators for fatigue among working women.",
            "This study preliminarily investigated the association between these biomarkers and results of the self-administered questionnaires for \"sensation of fatigue.\"",
            "Furthermore, we examined the differences between shift workers and daytime workers as shift workers are considered to have greater exposure to mental and/or physical stress than office or daytime workers.",
            "Methods",
            "This study was approved by the ethics review board of the Japan Organization of Occupational Health and Society.",
            "All participants provided written informed consent.",
            "Study participants consisted of 118 full-time-working women, including 54 public employees, 40 nurses, and 24 office workers.",
            "Mean age \u00b1 standard deviation was 37.8\u00b111.0 years.",
            "Of the 118 women, 55 were shift workers.",
            "Of the 55 local government prison officers who attended a workshop, 54 were accepted to participate in this study by informed consent.",
            "Of the 40 nurses who worked in a hospital, all were accepted.",
            "Of the 29 office workers in an organization for occupational health and safety, 24 were accepted.",
            "Self-administered questionnaires including a visual analog scale (VAS) for general health: \"sensation of fatigue,\" life-style questionnaire, SF-8 for health-related quality of life, and K6 for screening of mental health were carried out two days prior to blood work.",
            "Shift workers completed the questionnaires before the start of the day shift.",
            "Beat-to-beat variation in each subject was measured and analyzed using an acceleration plethysmography (APG) system (ARTETD; Umedica, Osaka, Japan).",
            "The APG test was performed before the start of the day shift.",
            "APG waves were recorded from one finger while subjects were in the sitting position and fully clothed.",
            "An APG wave is the second differential wave of a pulse wave, which stabilizes the baseline of the waves and allows for an accurate measurement of rate intervals (consecutive a-wave intervals).",
            "To assess autonomic function according to frequency domains, [low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) power and LF/HF ratios] were determined.",
            "For the analyses of frequency domains, consecutive a-a intervals were analyzed using the maximum entropy method, where the power spectra at 0.02-0.15 and 0.15-0.5 Hz corresponded to LF and HF, respectively.",
            "The resolution of the spectrum was set at 0.001 Hz.",
            "From the power spectra, LF and HF components were presented as ms2.",
            "Blood was collected from the shift workers at rest before the start of the day shift.",
            "Among non-shift workers, blood was collected on a holiday or after work and at rest.",
            "The serum level of d-ROMs and biological antioxidant potential (BAP) were evaluated.",
            "Oxidation and anti-oxidation activities were measured simultaneously in the serum.",
            "Oxidative and anti-oxidative activities were assessed by measuring d-ROMs and BAP, respectively, using FREE Carrio Duo (Diacron International, Italy).",
            "Statistical Analysis",
            "First, the distribution of d-ROMs, BAP, and the LF/HF ratio was determined using a histogram.",
            "LF/HF distribution was considered abnormal, and a log10 conversion was performed.",
            "To find confounding factors among variables, the correlation was determined using Spearman's or Pearson's method.",
            "The significance of difference between the two groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney U test or Student's t-test.",
            "The significance of difference among three groups was determined using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni's method.",
            "Multiple adjustments were performed using analysis of covariance.",
            "A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
            "Results",
            "Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. Body mass index (BMI) was 21.9\u00b13.5 kg/m2.",
            "The means of d-ROMs, BAP, and the LF/HF ratio were 349 CARR U, 2206 \u03bcmol/l, and 1.89, respectively.",
            "Correlations between the LF/HF ratio, d-ROMs, and BAP and background characteristics and lifestyles are examined (see supplementary Table).",
            "d-ROMs were significantly correlated with age (r=0.311, p<0.01), BMI (r=0.201, p<0.05), and drinking habit (r=0.253, p<0.01), but not with other lifestyle factors.",
            "BAP showed significant negative correlation with smoking (r=-0.240, p<0.01).",
            "The means of BAPs of non-smokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers were 2265.9\u00b1329.0, 2271.5\u00b1346.5, and 1985.4\u00b1323.5 \u03bcmol/l, respectively, showing significantly low values in current smokers (p=0.005).",
            "However, BAP was not associated with the Brinckman index (r=0.073, p=0.781).",
            "BAP showed a significant association with VAS (r=0.482, p<0.01) and the log10 LF/HF ratio (r=0.395, p<0.01) among shift workers.",
            "The log10 LF/HF ratio was significantly negatively associated with exercise habit (r=-0.200, p<0.05), and positively associated with commuting-time (r=0.186, p<0.05) (see supplement Table).",
            "The results of a comparison between shift and daytime workers are shown in Table 2.",
            "Although there were no significant differences in background factors, such as age, BMI, communication time, duration of sleep, and drinking/smoking, the BAP and log10 LF/HF ratio were significantly higher in shift workers than in daytime workers (Table 2).",
            "BAP was more widely distributed in shift workers than daytime workers.",
            "In addition, BAP and log10 LF/HF ratio were adjusted for age, BMI, communication time, duration of sleep, habit of drinking/smoking, and VDT time.",
            "After adjustment, the results also show significant difference between daytime and shift workers in BAP (2088.1 (standard error=38.2) vs. 2348.8 (42.4), p<0.0001) and log10 LF/HF ratio (-0.034 (0.054) vs. 0.201 (0.059), p=0.005).",
            "Discussion",
            "This study shows that \"fatigue\" and the \"sensation of fatigue\" could be not correlated with each other.",
            "When high values of biomarkers for the physical fatigue state are continuous, they may cause an increased risk in the onset of cardiovascular disease,.",
            "When symptoms of the sensation of fatigue are high, the worker can take action to notify their supervisor and/or occupational health staff about their condition, who will then take countermeasures to reduce the risk.",
            "However, fatigue is currently assessed based on recognized symptoms alone.",
            "Thus, when symptoms are absent and biomarkers are high, the worker would be at high risk in the future because no action to reduce the risk would be taken by the supervisor and/or occupational health staff.",
            "Therefore, measuring these biomarkers might be helpful to reduce the risk of health impairment caused by work overload.",
            "Literature on d-ROMs and BAP reports that confounding factors include sex differences, age, obesity, smoking, drinking, excessive exercise, ultraviolet rays, pregnancy, VDT time, and corpus luteum hormone,.",
            "However, in the present study, d-ROMs and BAP were not found to be consistently associated with these factors.",
            "According to correlation analysis, the same differences were seen between shift workers and daytime workers.",
            "Correlations between oxidative biomarkers and lifestyles may depend on the study subjects.",
            "As our study population consisted of healthy full-time workers, the appropriate adaptation for oxidative stress could be concurred.",
            "If d-ROMs are chronically high, BAP would be induced, resulting in the lowering of d-ROMs by neutralization.",
            "In the present study, BAP was negatively associated with smoking, consistent with the finding of a previous report.",
            "This result indicates that smoking is a strong inhibitory factor against oxidative stress among women.",
            "A decrease in BAP is frequently observed in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, whereas an increase in BAP is considered to be the result of adaptation for oxidative stress.",
            "When oxidative stress is continued by chronic fatigue and the capacity of neutralization is over, BAP will be decreased by consumption for neutralization.",
            "Therefore, BAP may depend on the balance between oxidative stress and neutralization capacity.",
            "In our study, BAP was found to be higher in shift workers than in daytime workers.",
            "Shift workers have disturbed circadian rhythms and imbalances in the level of melatonin, the hormone involved in the regulation of sleep, resulting in increased risk of health impairment.",
            "In this study, the individual value of BAP was widely distributed among shift workers compared with daytime workers.",
            "The effects of working in shifts seem to vary based on individuals.",
            "Some shift workers showed a high value of BAP, suggesting that BAP may be induced by shift work.",
            "LF/HF ratio was also higher in shift workers than in daytime workers.",
            "Literature on APG reports that confounding factors include strain, obesity, arrhythmia, sleep time, and exercise habits.",
            "A high LF/HF ratio indicates that the sympathetic nerve is predominant in autonomic function, suggesting the possibility of a future health impairment.",
            "The LF/HF ratio was negatively associated with exercise, and positively associated with commuting-time, which are particularly reasonable results.",
            "Thus, the LF/HF ratio may be indicative of fatigue and stress.",
            "In this study, the LF/HF ratio was associated with BAP.",
            "The association between and mechanisms of the autonomic nervous system and oxidative stress, however, are largely unknown.",
            "Further studies are required to better understand this relationship.",
            "In this study, we examined the efficacy of indicators: oxidative stress and APG for women.",
            "Thus, the effects of the menstrual cycle were examined.",
            "According to a result of our preliminary investigation, information on the days from the first day of menstruation was obtained by an interview, and divided into four periods; the follicle period (menstruation 0-13 days), luteal phase (menstruation 14th~), menopause, and other days.",
            "We then examined the associations between menstrual cycles and LF/HF ratio, d-ROMs, and BAP.",
            "Consequently, no associations were seen (Ebata's unpublished data).",
            "There are several limitations to this study.",
            "First, it is a small-scale study, with a small sample size obtained from different workplaces.",
            "Second, it is a cross-sectional study.",
            "Third, uncontrolled confounding factors may be present.",
            "In addition, blood sampling time was not controlled.",
            "Thus, further controlled, prospective studies with consideration of the circadian rhythm are needed.",
            "In this study, there were workers who had fewer recognized symptoms and higher values of d-ROMs and LF/HF ratio.",
            "In the future, these workers may have health impairments.",
            "Thus, future prospective studies should be conducted.",
            "These studies are particularly important because the current counterplan against work overload is based on self-reported questions.",
            "Objective biomarkers to estimate fatigue and stress should be established in the field of occupational health as soon as possible.",
            "We believe that the LF/HF ratio, d-ROMs and BAP are potential candidates for this purpose.",

            "The onset of DNA replication normally is coincident with an increase in histone 1 phosphorylation and a relaxation in chromatin structure.",
            "In this paper we show that 5 mM theophylline, added 2 h after selective detachment to synchronized HeLa-S-3 cells, delays the onset and reduces the rate of DNA synthesis while theophylline treatment beginning at 8 h has no effect on subsequent DNA synthesis.",
            "These actions of theophylline are accompanied by an inhibition of histone 1 phosphorylation and a prevention of the normal relaxation in chromatin structure between G1 and S phases as revealed by image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei .",
            "The time courses of intracellular cyclic AMP levels, nonhistone protein phosphorylation, and [3 H]lysine incorporation are also compared in the same treated and untreated synchronized HeLa cells.",
            "Comparison with experiments using 1-a-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) shows that the above phenomena are not a direct result of inhibition of DNA synthesis.",
            "We interpret our results as evidence that the associations between histone 1 phosphorylation, chromatin relaxation, and the onset of DNA synthesis are temporally and causally related .",
            "Variations in chromatin structure during the cell cycle have been well documented using a variety of biochemical and biophysical probes.",
            "In the past several years these studies have been extended to chromatin in the intact cell using techniques such as flow microfluorimetry or image analysis of Feulgenstained nuclei.",
            "This capability not only has the potential of circumventing certain of the artifacts introduced by isolation by bulk chromatin but also allows observations of the properties of chromatin from individual cells.",
            "Interestingly, it was found that changes in nuclear-DNA morphology during the HeLa cell cycle (1), as well as in diploid fibroblasts after stimulation (2) or virus transformation (3), correlate well with alterations in isolated chromatin structure and its functional state as measured by template activity, circular dichroism, and the number of primary binding sites of intercalating dyes (4) .",
            "Specifically, increases in average optical density (AOD) or form factor (FF) (area/[perimeter]",
            "2) or nuclear-stained DNA in situ were associated with decreases in template activity, circular dichroism at 272 nm, and the number of primary dye binding sites all measured in vitro .",
            "Moreover, image analysis of single cell nuclear chromatin revealed that the modulation of structure during the HeLa cell 78 THOMAS W. DOLBY, ANDREW BELMONT, THADDEUS W. BORUN, and CLAUDIO NICOLINI The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, and Department of Physiology-Biophysics, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19122 cycle was much more pronounced than suggested by the average properties of isolated chromatin from synchronized populations .",
            "In particular, image analysis of individual cells coupled with autoradiography indicated that what had appeared as a gradual and continuous transition from a maximally condensed chromatin at 5 h after mitosis (\"middle Gi\") to a maximally relaxed chromatin at 12 h after mitosis (\"middle-S\") (5,6) was actually most likely a more abrupt transition from a maximally condensed late Gl nucleus with high AOD and high FF to a maximally relaxed early S nucleus with low average optical density and low form factor (7) .",
            "Exposure of synchronized cells to 1-,8-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C), a drug that blocks DNA synthesis by the inhibition of DNA polymerase and ligase enzymes, resulted in cells containing 2c DNA content arrested at the GI -S border in the relaxed conformation of early S nuclei, thus proving that the transition from a condensed to relaxed morphology was not a result of DNA synthesis but perhaps a prerequisite (8) .",
            "Biochemical studies have associated an increase in one type of histone 1 phosphorylation with the onset of DNA synthesis (9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18) . (Another type of histone 1 phosphorylation, presumably occurring at different sites, has been linked by Rattle et al . 1191 to condensation of chromatin from G2 to mitosis.",
            "However, as shown experimentally [20], and indicated on general theoretical grounds,' the influence of phosphorylation on histone 1-DNA interactions is strongly site-specific.)",
            "Later circular dichroism measurements coupled with thermal denaturation studies indicated that changes in the interactions of histone 1, DNA, and nonhistone chromosomal proteins were associated with the phosphorylation of H1 and appeared to be responsible for the relaxation of the compact GI chromatin into a more open or relaxed S-phase configuration (5).",
            "This last conclusion was of great interest in light of the known influence of cyclic nucleotide levels on the phosphorylation state of various proteins and the more recent associations between changing cyclic nucleotide levels and cell proliferation.",
            "Specifically, increases in cyclic AMP levels have been observed in many (21)(22)(23)(24)(25), but not all (26,27), types of cells as they approach quiescence, while increased intracellular levels in cyclic AMP levels produced either by exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP (28)(29)(30)(31), dibutyryl cyclic AMP in conjunction with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (29)(30)(31)(32), or phosphodiesterase inhibitors alone (33)(34)(35), inhibit cell proliferation.",
            "Indeed, the action of certain phosphodiesterase inhibitors, including theophylline and caffeine, has been shown to involve a shift of untransformed cells from Gl to Go (33,35) as well as a cell cycle arrest in G2 (33) .",

            "In confirmation of earlier reports, exposure of synchronized HeLa cells to a 5-mM concentration of theophylline beginning 2 h after selective mitoic detachment produced a partial arrest of cells in Gr. As shown in Fig. 1,[ r4 C]thymidine incorporation for the theophylline-treated cells remains at baseline values until -12 h after mitosis at which time detectable DNA synthesis begins to occur.",
            "In comparison, in the control population, [14 C]thymidine incorporation rises sharply beginning at -5 h after mitosis, reaching a peak at slightly after 10 h .",
            "Examination of the image analysis data further clarifies the situation.",
            "It is apparent from the IOD vs . cell number histograms, seen in Fig. 2 as the projection along the x axis of the respective two-parameter histograms, that the slow rise in thymidine incorporation occurring at 12 h in the theophyllinetreated population (Fig. 2B,panel d) is caused by a small fraction (15%) of the cells progressing through early S phase, while the majority of the cells are blocked with 2c DNA content .",
            "The fraction of cells which manages to pass the block and progress through S slowly increases with time, reaching roughly 50% at 18 h (Fig. 2B, panel f) .",
            "Moreover, a rough estimate of S-phase duration, produced by focusing on the number of cells in early S (2 .1C-3C) and late S and G 2 (3C-4C) vs. time, reveals that those cells that escape the G t (or Gt -S border) block progress through S phase at a slower rate than normal.",
            "Indeed, whereas at 8 h in the control slide there are only 61/200 cells in early S (the majority with DNA content in the range 2 .1-2 .5C), at 12 h there are 96/200 in late S and G 2 .",
            "Yet, for the theophylline-treated cells, while at 12 h there are 30/200 cells in early S, at 15 h there are only 16/200 cells in late S and G2 .",
            "Similarly, while at 15 h there are 57/200 cells in early S and 16/200 cells in late S and G2, at 18 h there are only 21/200 cells in late S and G2 .",
            "This action of theophylline cannot be attributed simply to a direct inhibition of the cellular apparatus for DNA synthesis or to a generalized toxic effect .",
            "Returning to Fig . 1, we see that administration of the same theophylline concentration at 8 h after mitosis produces no change in [ 14 C]thymidine incorporation relative to the control.",
            "Experiments examining the uptake of media [\"C]thymidine in the presence or absence of theophylline show no significant alteration of intracellular transport within a 1-h treatment up to at least 10 h postmitosis (data not shown) .",
            "In addition, not only have other investigators demonstrated the reversibility of theophylline's action (33), but also [3H]lysine incorporation was found to be identical for the control and theophylline-treated cells between 3 and 10 h after The effects of Ara-C and theophylline on [2-' 4C]thymidine incorporation during the HeLa S-3 cell cycle.",
            "Upper panel: HeLa S-3 cells were collected in mitosis, resuspended in 300 ml of medium A at 3 X 105 cells/ml and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. 100 ml of the culture was removed at 2 h after mitosis (G,) and treated with 40 Ag/ml Ara-C. 100 ml was removed at 8 h after mitosis (S) and similarly treated.",
            "2-ml samples were removed from the control and Ara-C-treated cultures at the indicated times, pulse-labeled with 0.2,uCi [2-' \u00b0]thymidine for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, and the radioactivity incorporated in 5% TCA-precipitable material was determined as previously described (5) . \", Control; X, Ara-C added at 8 h; O, Ara-C added at 2 h .",

            "Thus, theophylline does not appear to be affecting the overall protein synthesis rate (in particular, the synthesis of lysine-rich histone would seem to be unaffected) .",
            "As anticipated, however, the action of theophylline is associated with a dramatic change in the pattern of histone 1 phosphorylation as shown in Fig.",
            "3 .",
            "After pulse-labeling control and drug-treated cells with 32P at 2 and 9 .5 h after mitosis as described in the legend to Fig . 3, histone was extracted as described in Materials, and histone 1 components were resolved by extended electrophoresis on long polyacrylamide gels (14) .",
            "It may be seen in the upper left panel of Fig . 3 that histone 1 components extracted from control G r cells migrate in these gels as two principal peaks (forms I and II) which incorporate rather low amounts of 32P during the 75-min labeling period .",
            "As control cells enter S phase, the apparent rate of 32P incor-  poration into histone 1 increases 10-fold (9) and the migration of phosphorylated histone 1 components is retarded such that three principal peaks (forms II and III) are now resolved by gel electrophoresis (upper right panel, Fig. 3).",
            "Recent experiments (41) indicate that the three peaks of histone 1 in HeLa cells resolved under these conditions represent complex mixtures of two distinct molecular components : (a) mol wt 20,000 ; (b) mol wt 21,000 .",
            "During S phase, these components acquire more phosphate groups that retard their migration .",
            "However, 5-mM theophylline treatment from 2 to 10.75 h after mitosis significantly inhibits the apparent level of histone 132p incorporation and causes histone 1 components to remain as rapidly migrating protein species that are smaller than those normally found in G l cells.",
            "In contrast, Ara-C treatment beginning 2 h after mitosis at a concentration (40 t-tg/ml) completely inhibits subsequent DNA synthesis but not phosphorylation of previously synthesized histone 1 components (9) which also migrated as the three principal peaks, as again seen in Fig . 3, even though the apparent level of histone 1 phosphorylation was cut in half.",
            "This implies that the influence of theophylline on histone 1 phosphorylation is not simply a result of the inhibition of DNA synthesis .",
            "While histone 1 phosphorylation is reduced in theophylline-treated cells, nonhistone phosphorylation at 10 h after mitosis is increased relative to control cells with marked increases in certain protein species (data not shown) .",
            "Thus, it appears that theophylline can potentiate some NHCP phosphorylations while greatly inhibiting histone H1 phosphorylation and the progression of DNA synthesis .",
            "In light of previous suggestions discussed in the introduction, correlating the onset of DNA synthesis with the relaxation of chromatin in cells at the GT-S boundary and correlating this change in chromatin conformation with increases in histone 1 phosphorylation, attention must now be devoted to an examination of the variations in nuclear morphology induced by theophylline treatment .",
            "This may be accomplished by studying Table I, which summarizes the average values and sample standard deviations of the measured parameters described in Materials and Methods for the entire population at various times after mitosis as well as for subpopulations selected by IOD, and Figs. 2,4, and 5 which display, respectively, the IOD vs.",

            "The ranges of both AOD and FF are the same in the two populations and, although there are slight differences indicative of a more dispersed nuclear morphology in the treated population, it is not completely clear whether these differences are real or rather a statistical fluctuation caused by the sample population size.",
            "However, two-tailed statistical tests indicate that the difference in means of the two populations is statistically significant with a significance level of --2 .5% .",
            "At 5 h, though, the difference is striking.",

            "Here, two-tailed statistical comparisons of the means for the 2c DNA content subpopulation show significant differences (at a significance level of -2%) for the AOD and the area, but not for the FF .",
            "As noted earlier, in contrast to the apparent similarity in morphometry at this time there is a marked functional difference emerging: roughly 20P/o of the control populations has entered S phase by this time, as compared to nearly 001o of the treated population .",
            "At 12 h after mitosis, significant morphometrical differences between the two populations re-emerge.",

            "As shown in Fig. 5, by this time their nuclear morphometry lies in a relatively homogeneous window of low AOD and low FF .",
            "Although the theophyllinetreated cells also show evidence of the same chromatin relaxation, based on the global averages for AOD and FF found in Table I, this can be seen to be an artifact caused by the different cell cycle phase composition of the two populations .",
            "Focusing only on the 2c DNA subpopulations, Table I and Fig. 5 show that there is a significantly higher average AOD and average FF for the treated 2c DNA population as a result of only a fraction of the treated 2c DNA population's having relaxed and altered shape to the extent of the control 2c DNA cells at this time .",
            "The remainder of the 2c DNA theophylline-treated cell nuclei, while having experienced a reduction in AOD such that their AOD lies between that of the highly condensed nuclei found in late G, and the dispersed nuclei of early S phase, still have maintained the high FF of late G, cells.",
            "This general distribution pattern is maintained in the 2c DNA- treated subpopulations at later times (15 and 18 h) as well.",
            "Thus, the failure of a large proportion of theophylline-treated cells to enter S phase at the normal time is associated with a failure of their nuclear morphometry to change to the less round forms characteristic of control early S phase and to a lesser extent with the failure of their unclear density to disperse to the extent of control early S phase nuclei.",
            "Finally, examination of Fig . 6 reveals that the modulations in nuclear morphometry decribed above are not related directly to cyclic AMP levels.",

            "Although it is interesting to note that the dramatic effect produced by theophylline on nuclear morphology at 5 h after mitosis is coincident with a significant rise in cyclic AMP levels, it must also be noted that even at 10 h the cyclic AMP level in the DISCUSSION treated cells is well above the maximum level reached in the control .",
            "Moreover, theophylline treatment at 8 h produced similar rises in cyclic AMP but did not affect ['\"CJthymidine incorporation .",
            "Although theophylline causes a 20% rise in cyclic AMP levels 2-4 h after treatment, whether the mid-G,, late G,, or early S, this increase did not produce the onset of DNA synthesis or the decondensation of chromatin .",

            "An analysis of the role of theophylline in producing a delay in the onset and a reduction in the rate of DNA synthesis in synchronized HeLa cells must begin with the observation that the action of theophylline is unrelated to direct interference with the enzymatic apparatus of DNA synthesis as noted earlier in the paper.",

            "It does not explain the theophylline-induced variations in nuclear morphometry reported in this paper unless the same perturbation in the DNA synthesis enzymatic pathways incidentally also produced these same changes or unless these changes are additional events induced by theophylline and independent of the action involving DNA synthesis .",
            "Given that the induced morphological structural changes are opposite to those nor- mally observed in the transition from G, -* S, both explanations would assign such an action of theophylline to the status of a mere coincidence.",
            "The alternative hypothesis is that the critical event involves modification of the chromatin structure which, in turn, permits DNA synthesis under those conditions in which the required substrates and enzymes are present and uninhibited, and that theophylline interferes with this normal modification .",
            "The observed variations in nuclear morphometry induced by theophylline would now be explained as an expected reflection of interference with this modification .",
            "With this hypothesis, interest in the normal association of S phase with histone 1 phosphorylation and the possibility that there exists a causal relationship between histone 1 phosphorylation and chromatin structure is greatly enhanced (5) by the observed inhibition of histone I phosphorylation occurring with theophylline treatment .",
            "In summary, then, our results show that the theophyllineinduced delay and inhibition of DNA synthesis in synchronized HeLa cells is accompanied by both an arrest of nuclear morphometry in a morphological state intermediate to that of late G, and early S and an inhibition of histone 1 phosphorylation .",
            "A comparison of data obtained by exposing cells to Ara-C, rather than theophylline, indicates that both the above phenomena are not a direct result of inhibition of DNA synthesis.",
            "At present, our best explanation of our results is that the associations between the inhibition of DNA synthesis, the altered nuclear morphometry, and the inhibition of histone 1 phosphorylation are related causally ."

            "Smoking, nutrition, parity and oral contraceptive use have been reported as major environmental risk factors for cervical cancer.",
            "After the discovery of the very strong link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer, it is unclear whether the association of these environmental factors with cervical cancer reflect secondary associations attributable to confounding by HPV, if they are independent risk factors or whether they may act as cofactors to HPV infection in cervical carcinogenesis.",
            "To investigate this issue, we performed a population-based case-control study in the V\u00e4sterbotten county of Northern Sweden of 137 women with high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN 2-3) and 253 healthy age-matched women.",
            "The women answered a 94-item questionnaire on diet, smoking, oral contraceptive use and sexual history and donated specimens for diagnosis of present HPV infection (nested polymerase chain reaction on cervical brush samples) and for past or present HPV infections (HPV seropositivity).",
            "The previously described protective effects of dietary micronutrients were not detected.",
            "Pregnancy appeared to be a risk factor in the multivariate analysis (P < 0.0001).",
            "Prolonged oral contraceptive use and sexual history were associated with CIN 2-3 in univariate analysis, but these associations lost significance after taking HPV into account.",
            "Smoking was associated with CIN 2-3 (odds ratio (OR) 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-4.0), the effect was dosedependent (P = 0.002) and the smoking-associated risk was not affected by adjusting for HPV, neither when adjusting for HPV DNA (OR 2.5, CI 1.3-4.9) nor when adjusting for HPV seropositivity (OR 3.0, CI 1.9-4.7).",
            "In conclusion, after taking HPV into account, smoking appeared to be the most significant environmental risk factor for cervical neoplasia.",
            "Infection with the oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) has been established as a main cause of high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN 2-3), an immediate precursor of cervical cancer (Lorincz et al, 1992;Cuzick et al, 1994).",
            "The time lag between infection and development of invasive cervical cancer is probably on average more than 15 years (\u00d6st\u00f6r, 1993).",
            "Most HPV infections clear spontaneously but a minority of infections, especially of high-risk types, will persist and those are a major risk factor for development of CIN 2-3 (Ho et al, 1998).",
            "The risk factors that determine whether HPV infection will be transient or become persistent as well as the risk factors that determine progression from CIN to invasive cervical cancer are insufficiently known.",
            "Since certain risk factors for cervical cancer or CIN such as smoking and oral contraceptive use have been reported to be associated with HPV infection (Hildesheim et al, 1990;Butterworth et al, 1992;Burger et al, 1993;Eluf-Neto et al, 1994;Ho et al, 1998;Kruger-Kjaer et al, 1998;Kwasniewska et al, 1998;Olsen et al, 1998) this may have confounded the risk ratios.",
            "The transient nature of HPV infections makes epidemiological studies of HPV exposure as such difficult, since women currently negative for HPV DNA may have been infected previously.",
            "However, the serum antibody response to HPV capsids will persist on long-term follow-up, even after HPV infection is no longer found (af Geijersstam et al, 1998) and is a useful marker of life-time HPV exposure (Olsen et al, 1997).",
            "As most previous studies have either not taken HPV into account or only studied present infection, we conducted a population-based case-control study of CIN 2-3 in Northern Sweden, taking past and present HPV exposures into account.",

            "Between October 1993 and December 1995, 254 women with a pathological cervical smear, referred for colposcopy in V\u00e4sterbotten county were asked to participate.",
            "One hundred and seventy-four women were referred from the population-based cervical screening programme and 76 because of smears taken outside the programme.",
            "They were referred to any of the three hospitals in V\u00e4sterbotten county: Ume\u00e5 University Hospital, Skellefte\u00e5 Community Hospital or Lycksele Community Hospital.",
            "Four of the referred women refused to participate in the study, and the remaining 250 were enrolled.",
            "One hundred and thirty-seven of these women were finally diagnosed with CIN 2-3.",
            "The final diagnosis was based on blinded histopathological re-classification by an experienced pathologist of stored archival biopsy specimens (130 cases) and for seven cases where an archival biopsy was not available, on a blinded reclassification of the cytological archival specimen.",

            "Screening group",
            "A group of women who were invited by letter for screening in the organized programme were asked by an additional enclosed letter to attend the study.",

            "From October 1995 until March 1996, out of 2191 invited women, 871 were asked to participate and 320 accepted.",
            "In order to find out the reason 63% did not accept the invitation, a randomly selected subgroup of 50 of these women was interviewed by telephone by the same investigator.",
            "Two were not interested to participate in the screening programme at all.",
            "The other 48 women had recently seen or intended to see a doctor or midwife for screening and did not want to participate because of inconvenience.",
            "Sampling procedures",
            "In January 1995, the organized screening programme switched cervical sampling device to Cervex brush (Cortec Medical AB, Malm\u00f6, Sweden) that permits collecting cell samples from both ecto-and endocervix.",
            "The 114 samples that were taken before that time were taken with a cotton-tipped pin in the endocervix and a wooden spatula from the ectocervix and posterior fornix.",
            "Before colposcopic examination, a sample for HPV DNA was taken from the endocervix by a rotary motion with a Cytobrush (Medscand, Malm\u00f6, Sweden) for detection of cervical HPV DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with consensus primers and type-specific primers for HPV 11, 16, 18 and 33.",
            "The HPV sample was stored in physiologic saline containing 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8 and kept at -70\u00b0C until analysis.",
            "If the colposcopic examination was normal an annual follow-up was arranged.",
            "In the screening population, all women were examined by the same physician.",

            "Oral contraceptive pill intake has been postulated to induce a local folic acid deficiency and interfere with DNA synthesis, repair or somehow alter the susceptibility of cells to oncogenic viruses or chemical carcinogens and therefore be a risk factor for CIN (Butterworth et al, 1982;Harper et al, 1994).",
            "We found no association of folate intake with CIN 2-3 in the first place and also did not detect any interaction between folate intake and OC use.",

            "The dietary associations found in this study (increased risk associated with boiled coffee and with high intake of dairy products) have not been consistently found in previous studies and the possibility exists that they may be chance associations attributable to multiple hypothesis testing.",
            "Further studies would be needed to evaluate the consistency of these risks.",

            "However, HPV seropositivity is not completely sensitive (estimated at 50-70% sensitivity; Kjellberg et al, 1999) and attenuation but not elimination of risks after adjusting for HPV seropositivity may also reflect residual confounding.",

            "The effects of smoking have been well studied and show a strong association to CIN and cervical cancer (Cuzick et al, 1990;Winkelstein, 1990;Phillips and Smith, 1994;Ho et al, 1998;Kruger-Kjaer et al, 1998;Olsen et al, 1998).",
            "Chemical carcinogens in tobacco, such as cotinine and nicotine, probably exert a mitogenic effect by activating carcinogenic nitrosamines and causing DNA damage and also may impair the local immune defence in the cervical epithelium.",
            "However, the fact that smoking as a behaviour in some populations is associated with a lifestyle with increased risk for HPV infection has suggested that the association seen with smoking may be due to residual confounding from HPV or other sexually transmitted pathogens (Winkelstein, 1990;Ho et al, 1998).",
            "The fact that the significant excess risk for CIN 2-3 associated with smoking was not reduced by adjustment for HPV indicates that smoking does indeed have a causal association with CIN 2-3.",

            "Compared to non-drinkers, a total ethanol intake of >620\u2009g\u2009month\u22121 was significantly related to a decreased risk of renal cell cancer (odds ratio (OR) 0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4\u20130.9; P-value for trend=0.03).",
            "The risk decreased 30\u201340% with drinking more than two glasses per week of red wine (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4\u20130.9), white wine (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4\u20131.0), or strong beer (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4\u20131.0); there was a clear linear trend of decreasing risk with increasing consumption of these beverages (P-values for trends <0.05).",
            "Case\u2013control and prospective studies have shown an inverse association between alcohol intake and risk of renal cell cancer, but no association or a slightly elevated risk among the highest category of beer drinkers was found in others.",
            "In studies that showed a reduced risk, the association was more pronounced for wine, wine and liquor, beer, or beer and liquor.",
            "These differences may be due to small sample sizes in many studies and they require further investigation.",
            "We investigated the association of different types of alcoholic beverages and of total alcohol (ethanol) consumption with the risk of renal cell cancer in a large population-based case\u2013control study in Sweden.",
            "MATERIALS AND METHODS",
            "We carried out a population-based case\u2013control study of men and women aged 20\u201379 years without previously diagnosed renal cell cancer (ICD-9 diagnosis code 189.0), born in Sweden or any other Nordic country and resident in Sweden between 1 January 1996 and 30 June 1998.",
            "Through regional cancer registers, we identified all incident cases of renal cell cancer (n=1275) in five of Sweden's six hospital regions.",
            "Patients were asked to participate through their physicians.",
            "A total of 877 cases (69%) participated in the study.",
            "Non-participation was because of death (12% of identified cases), the patient being too ill or disabled (6%), or patient refusal (13%).",
            "The cancer patients were contacted at least 1 month after diagnosis and on average after 3 months.",
            "Control subjects were randomly selected from the Swedish population registry and were frequency-matched to cases by sex, age in 10-year strata, and place of residence.",
            "Of the 2046 selected control subjects, 1508 (74%) agreed to participate, with non-participation mainly because of refusal (24% of subjects).",
            "All regional ethics committees approved the study protocol.",
            "All case and control subjects received a self-administered questionnaire on personal and medical history, as well as dietary habits and alcohol consumption 5 years before study, disregarding recent changes.",
            "We asked about the usual frequency of consumption of medium-strong beer (2.8\u2009g ethanol per 100\u2009g), strong beer (4.5\u2009g ethanol per 100\u2009g), white wine (8.9\u2009g ethanol per 100\u2009g), red wine (9.9\u2009g ethanol per 100\u2009g), strong wine (16\u2009g ethanol per 100\u2009g), and hard liquor (32\u2009g ethanol per 100\u2009g).",
            "The respondents answered in terms of number of drinks per week, month, or year, given standard portion sizes (a glass of beer=200\u2009ml, a glass of wine=100\u2009ml, and a glass of strong wine or hard liquor=40\u2009ml).",
            "Light beer (1.8\u2009g ethanol per 100\u2009g) consumption was given in a range of nine predetermined response categories ranging from \u2018never\u2019 to \u2018three times a day or more\u2019.",
            "We converted frequency and amount of alcohol into total grams of ethanol.",
            "The questionnaire also covered education, smoking, usual adulthood weight, height, hypertension, and diabetes.",
            "If needed, we contacted subjects by telephone for missing details.",
            "Nine cases and 284 controls failed to return the mailed questionnaire and were instead interviewed only by telephone.",
            "This short telephone interview did not include the questions on alcohol consumption.",
            "Furthermore, 13 cases and 20 controls did not answer the question on alcohol consumption in the questionnaire.",
            "Unconditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) as estimates of relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).",
            "Data were explored in models including only sex and age (categorised as <40, 40\u201349, 50\u201359, 60\u201369, 70\u201379 years) in addition to models with sex, age and the following covariates: cigarette smoking (never smoked, smokers stratified as low (\u2a7d16.7 pack-years) or high (>16.7 pack-years)); usual adulthood body mass index (BMI, weight\u2009height\u22122 (kg\u2009m\u22122), stratified into quartiles); years of education (<10, 10\u201312, >12); hypertension (yes/no); diabetes (yes/no).",
            "Subjects who had quit smoking were classified as low (67%) or high (33%), according to their pack-years consumption.",

            "Median values of exposure categories were entered as continuous variables into multivariate regression models to assess the significance of linear trend with increasing exposure.",
            "RESULTS",
            "A total of 855 cases and 1204 controls reported their alcohol consumption and were included in the analyses.",
            "The distributions according to age, cigarette smoking, BMI, education, hypertension, and diabetes among case and control subjects are shown in Table 1.",
            "Cases and controls were broadly similar in distribution by sex (59% male cases and 61% male controls), and age (64.3 years among cases and 64.4 among controls).",
            "The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was higher among case subjects.",
            "Control subjects had a somewhat lower BMI, but there was no major difference in the prevalence of smoking or education.",
            "Control subjects with missing alcohol consumption had a higher BMI than control subjects who were included in the analyses.",
            "No differences in characteristics were observed between cases with missing information on alcohol consumption and those included in the analyses.",
            "Fifteen per cent of the study population (136 cases and 179 control subjects) reported not drinking alcohol (including light beer) while two-thirds drank different types of alcoholic beverage, 11% drank only beer, 3% only wine, and 4% only strong wine or hard liquor.",
            "Consumption of white wine and red wine was correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.58; 95% CI 0.55\u20130.60).",
            "Correlation coefficient between white wine and strong beer was 0.29 (95% CI 0.25\u20130.33) and between red wine and strong beer was 0.27 (95% CI 0.24\u20130.32).",
            "Alcohol intake was not related to BMI (r=\u22120.01; 95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.03).",
            "Control subjects drank more alcohol than cases, especially more wine.",
            "Men consumed beer and hard liquor more often and in greater quantities than women.",
            "Smokers drank more alcohol than non-smokers among both cases and controls.",
            "Total ethanol intake was statistically significantly associated with a decreased risk of renal cell cancer (Table 2).",
            "The multivariate OR for more than 650\u2009g\u2009month\u22121 (approximately 21\u2009g\u2009day\u22121) of ethanol compared to non-users of alcohol was 0.6 (95% CI 0.4\u20130.9).",
            "Although a statistically significant association was observed only for the >620\u2009g\u2009month\u22121 category, there was a significant inverse trend (P for trend=0.03).",
            "Odds ratios for different types of alcoholic beverage and total ethanol intake, and risk of renal cell cancer are presented in Table 3.",
            "In multivariate models including age, sex, BMI, and cigarette smoking (Model 1), consumption of more than two glasses of red wine per week was associated with a 40% (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4\u20130.9) reduction in risk compared to non-drinkers of red wine.",
            "An inverse association was also observed, albeit of borderline statistical significance, among those drinking more than two glasses per week of white wine (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4\u20131.0) or strong beer (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4\u20131.0).",
            "The risk of renal cell cancer decreased with increasing intake frequencies of white wine (P for trend=0.02), red wine (P for trend=0.01), and strong beer (P for trend=0.04).",
            "We found no relation between renal cell cancer risk and drinking of either light beer, medium-strong beer, strong wine, or hard liquor.",
            "Further adjustment of the multivariate models (Model 1) for education, hypertension, and diabetes did not affect the risk estimates (data not shown).",
            "When we additionally adjusted for the other six beverages in the multivariate regression model, this mutual adjustment did not change risk estimates for each specific alcoholic beverage (Model 2), suggesting that strong beer, white wine, and red wine were each responsible for the reduction in risk of renal cell cancer.",
            "To investigate if there is an effect modification by sex, we performed analyses of men and women separately.",
            "In the multivariate model, significant and nonsignificant inverse associations for total ethanol, strong beer, white wine, and red wine were observed in both men and women, but were less apparent in women (data not shown).",
            "Similarly, in analyses stratified by BMI (<25.0 vs \u2a7e25.0\u2009kg\u2009m\u22122), smoking (ever/never), and hypertension (yes/no), there were no differences between the subgroups (data not shown).",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "In this population-based case\u2013control study, we observed an inverse association between moderate alcohol intake and risk of renal cell cancer.",
            "Consumption of red wine, white wine, and strong beer was associated with a lower risk.",
            "However, there were no clear associations with light and medium beer, strong wine, or hard liquor, perhaps due to chance or differences in other risk factors related to specific types of alcoholic drink.",
            "For example, the large variation in other risk factors such as smoking and occupation could explain why hard liquor was not associated with renal cell cancer risk although we controlled for known risk factors.",
            "The major strengths of our study are its population-based design and the large number of cases.",
            "The Swedish regional cancer registers made it possible to ascertain virtually all incident cases of renal cell cancer and the National Population Registry enabled random selection of frequency-matched population controls.",
            "In this case\u2013control study, both cases and controls were selected from 19 counties in Sweden (covering 79% of the population) and the participation rate was relatively high.",
            "Nevertheless, a possible limitation might be selection bias due to non-participation or non-response.",
            "Although a substantial number of cancer patients (12%) died before they could be included or were too ill to participate (6%), this would influence the results only if alcohol consumption is associated with short-term prognosis of renal cell cancer.",
            "Refusing to participate could influence the results if this was associated with alcohol consumption.",
            "Another concern is that 97% (855) of the cases but only 80% (1204) of the control subjects in the study population answered the question on alcohol consumption.",
            "This difference is mainly due to the fact that alcohol consumption was not included in the short telephone interview with the 284 control subjects who failed to answer the mailed full questionnaire.",
            "Control subjects with missing alcohol consumption had a higher BMI than those who were included in the analyses, but alcohol intake was not related to BMI in our data.",
            "Any selection bias, therefore, has probably limited influence on our findings.",
            "We cannot rule out the possibility that misclassification of alcohol intake affected our results given that under-reporting of alcohol consumption has often been reported.",
            "However, our observed associations are not likely to be fully explained by misclassification of alcohol intake because validation studies demonstrate that self-reported alcohol assessment methods yield most realistic levels of intake if both the frequency and amount of consumption are asked for different types of alcoholic beverages separately.",
            "Any non-differential misclassification between cases and controls, or incorrect recalling of consumption, may lead to underestimation of the true association.",
            "If cases tended to under-report their intake more than controls, it would distort the observed OR towards a seemingly protective effect.",
            "However, inverse associations between alcohol intake and risk of renal cell cancer observed in prospective studies suggest that our results are not fully explained by such bias.",
            "Even though cigarette smoking is a risk factor for renal cell cancer, it did not confound the associations with alcoholic beverages in our study.",
            "The inverse association with alcohol mentioned in the above prospective studies, and in some case\u2013control studies, corresponds with our results, although the findings for each specific beverage varied across studies.",
            "A shortcoming in other studies is the inability to clearly disentangle the effect of different types of alcoholic beverage owing to limited number of only/mainly drinkers of wine, beer, or hard liquor.",
            "However, in our multivariate model with mutual adjustment for individual beverages, risk estimates did not markedly change.",
            "Because we asked for alcohol consumption 5 years before the study, we cannot account for variation in consumption over time or identify ex-drinkers in our analyses.",

            "Because obesity is a risk factor for renal cell cancer, and diabetics are at higher risk than those without diabetes, it is possible that improved insulin sensitivity lowers renal cell cancer risk.",
            "A reduced risk associated with consumption of wine and beer might be due to the phenolics they contain as these possess antioxidant and antimutagenic properties or increase plasma antioxidant capacity in human.",
            "However, the lower risk that we observed for three different alcoholic beverages and total ethanol intake suggests that alcohol itself rather than a particular type of drink is responsible for the reduction in risk.",
            "However, it is unclear why we observed an inverse association only for strong beer and not for medium\u2013strong, or light beer, although this might be due to the lower ethanol content of light (1.8%) and medium-strong (2.8%) beer compared to strong beer (4.5%).",
            "In conclusion, we found that moderate alcohol intake was associated with a lower risk of renal cell cancer.",

            "As in vivo exposure to MWCNT produced a transient inflammatory and progressive fibrotic response, this study sought to identify significant biological processes associated with lung inflammation and fibrosis pathology data, based upon whole genome mRNA expression, bronchoaveolar lavage scores, and morphometric analysis from C57BL/6J mice exposed by pharyngeal aspiration to 0, 10, 20, 40, or 80 \u00b5g MWCNT at 1, 7, 28, or 56 days post-exposure.",
            "Using a novel computational model employing non-negative matrix factorization and Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation, significant biological processes with expression similar to MWCNT-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis pathology data in mice were identified.",
            "A subset of genes in these processes was determined to be functionally related to either fibrosis or inflammation by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and were used to determine potential significant signaling cascades.",
            "Two genes determined to be functionally related to inflammation and fibrosis, vascular endothelial growth factor A (vegfa) and C-C motif chemokine 2 (ccl2), were confirmed by in vitro studies of mRNA and protein expression in small airway epithelial cells exposed to MWCNT as concordant with in vivo expression.",
            "This study identified that the novel computational model was sufficient to determine biological processes strongly associated with the pathology of lung inflammation and fibrosis and could identify potential toxicity signaling pathways and mechanisms of MWCNT exposure which could be used for future animal studies to support human risk assessment and intervention efforts.",
            "Introduction",
            "Nanotechnology is an emerging discipline in both industrial and medical fields, which necessitates the development of nanotoxicology to determine the biological effects of occupational and commercial nanoparticle exposure.",
            "Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are fibrous nanoparticles consisting of multiple concentric cylindrical carbon tubes that are appealing for both industrial and medical purposes due to their efficient electronic conductivity, great strength, and strong capillary forces, while maintaining a small size, light weight, high surface area to mass ratio, and low density.",
            "The physical attributes of MWCNT, while useful from an engineering standpoint, make them easily aerosolized and a potential inhalation hazard during synthesis, product use, and disposal.",
            "In vitro studies of MWCNT exposure determined toxicity to both lung epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells with increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, NF-\u0199B signaling, cytokine release, cytoskeletal reorganization, and endothelial cell permeability.",
            "Mouse and rat in vivo studies determined that MWCNT can reach the alveolar region of the lung after pharyngeal aspiration and inhalation, respectively, and induce a transient inflammatory reaction followed by a progressive fibrotic response.",
            "Although chronic inflammation has been suggested as the underlying mechanism governing the progression to fibrosis, this does not appear to hold true for MWCNT as the initial inflammatory response to MWCNT diminishes before the progressive fibrotic response begins.",
            "Therefore, it is essential to uncover the significant biological processes directing MWCNT-induced inflammation and fibrosis so as to determine potential outcomes and hallmarks of exposure.",
            "We hypothesize that the identification of transcription-related biological processes and pathways, which match the patterns of BAL quantification for inflammatory pathology and morphometric scoring of collagen for fibrosis in MWCNT-treated mice, could identify critical toxicity pathways and potential mechanisms of MWCNT-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis for early identification and intervention.",
            "Recently, our group conducted an in vivo dose-response time-course study of MWCNT exposure in C57BL/6J mice to determine the ability of MWCNT to induce pulmonary inflammation, damage, and fibrosis.",
            "Mice were exposed to 0, 10, 20, 40, or 80 \u00b5g of MWCNT by pharyngeal aspiration with endpoints monitored at 1, 7, 28, and 56 days post-exposure.",
            "The results indicated that a transient inflammatory response occurred 1 day post-exposure with peak activity 7 days post-exposure.",
            "A fibrotic response was noted 28 days post-exposure, which progressed through 56 days post-exposure.",
            "Nevertheless, MWCNT-induced toxicity pathways and mechanisms underlying these observed in vivo pathological responses remain unknown.",
            "We hypothesize that systematic analyses of gene expression profiles and pathological data could identify transcription-related biological processes correlated with the observed pathological patterns of lung inflammation and fibrosis, which could reveal MWCNT-induced toxicity pathways and pathogenesis.",

            "Fibroblast-like cells in the lung secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) along which the alveolar type II cells move.",
            "Upon resolution of the injury, this ECM is typically reabsorbed and normal lung function and architecture is maintained; however, when an inflammatory response becomes chronic due to persistent injury or uncontrolled signaling, the inflammatory process can become pathogenic.",
            "Fibrosis, excessive collagen production, in the lung occurs when the deposition of ECM is poorly controlled and there is a loss of normal lung function and architecture.",
            "Because many of the regulators of normal development and inflammation also govern the process of fibrosis, there are multiple hypotheses on what actions must occur for the response to switch from normal inflammation to pathogenic fibrosis.",

            "CCL2 is a known stimulator of the immune response, initiating chemotaxis in a variety of cell types, such as monocytes, lymphocytes, and basophils, as well as inducing the production of collagen from fibroblast cells.",
            "Due to these processes, CCL2 is suggested to play a role in inflammatory diseases.",
            "Interestingly, CCL2 has also been suggested to play a role in angiogenesis and upregulates the expression of VEGFA while, in turn, VEGFA has also been suggested to increase the expression of CCL2.",
            "The dose-dependent increase in ccl2 mRNA expression at all days and doses in vivo suggests its role in the initial inflammatory process.",
            "Although the in vivo mRNA levels of vegfa remained relatively constant across all days and doses, the in vivo protein levels are unknown and may enhance collagen production.",

            "Snuff use was associated with a decreased risk of CSCC.",
            "Overall, our study provides no evidence that tobacco use increases the risk of CSCC.",
            "Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a relatively common cancer worldwide, more common in males and the elderly, and a four-fold increase in age-standardised incidence has occurred in Sweden over the last four decades and this trend seems to be continuing.",
            "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is recognised as the most important risk factor for CSCC, although other definite or possible risk factors include immunosuppression, infection with oncogenic viruses, chronic inflammatory skin diseases, exposure to arsenic and high body mass index (BMI).",
            "Tobacco smoke and oral snuff contain a large number of carcinogenic substances.",
            "However, the relationship between tobacco use and/or oral snuff and CSCC has not been sufficiently investigated among humans and the evidence has been somewhat conflicting.",
            "We have investigated the possible role of tobacco smoking, snuff dipping and BMI in CSCC aetiology in a large nationwide cohort of Swedish construction workers.",
            "SUBJECTS AND METHODS",
            "The cohort and follow-up",
            "The Construction Industry's Organization for Working Environment, Safety and Health (Byggh\u00e4lsan) provided outpatient health services to construction workers all over Sweden from 1969 through 1993.",
            "Beginning in 1971, the information collected was stored in a computerised register, as described elsewhere.",
            "The first visit to the clinic defined entry into the cohort.",
            "Since no information on smoking history was collected from 1975 to 1977, we only included the workers who were registered between 1971\u20131975 and 1978\u20131992.",
            "Since over 95% of the cohort were men, we restricted our study to male workers and overall, 337\u2009311 men were included in the subsequent analyses.",
            "Exposure information was obtained by self-administered questionnaires double-checked by a nurse.",
            "The quality of the tobacco data has been reviewed and the answers are believed to be of high validity.",
            "Each cohort member was followed from date of entry into the cohort until CSCC diagnosis, death, emigration or end of follow-up 31 December 2000, whichever occurred first.",
            "The unique Swedish 10-digit personal identification number was used for follow-up by record linkage to the nationwide National Death Registry (date and cause of death), the Migration Registry (date of emigration) and the Swedish Cancer Registry.",
            "Statistical analyses",
            "The distribution of BMI was analysed in four groups according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria: underweight \u2a7d18.5; normal weight 18.6\u201325; overweight 25\u201330 and obese >30.",
            "Age was categorised in 5-year intervals.",
            "Cigarettes were assumed to contain 1\u2009g of tobacco and cigars 6\u2009g of tobacco each.",
            "Age-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using proportional hazards Cox regression model, with age and the relevant exposure factors as independent variables (Stata Statistical Software: Release 8.2. College Station, TX, USA: Stata Corporation).",
            "Interaction effects between tobacco variables, age and BMI were also included in the model and likelihood ratio tests were used to assess their significance.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Throughout follow-up, a total of 756 men developed CSCC, the risk increasing substantially with age.",
            "The mean age at entry was 34.2 (range 14\u201382) years and cohort members were followed on average for 19.4 years (range 0\u201331.3), yielding a total of 6\u2009536\u2009910 person-years of follow-up.",
            "In total, 58% of the subjects had ever smoked some tobacco product and 28% were ever snuff dippers.",
            "About 43% used one tobacco product only (29% were pure cigarette smokers and 13% were pure snuff dippers) and approximately 21% mixed two or more tobacco products \u2013 most frequently cigarettes and pipe (5%) or cigarettes and snuff (12%).",
            "Table 1 summarises the IRR and corresponding CI for all smoking tobacco taken together.",
            "Overall, no association between tobacco and the development of CSCC was found.",
            "Former and current smokers showed an IRR of 0.95 (95% CI 0.77\u20131.18) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.80\u20131.17), respectively, compared to those who never smoked.",
            "No effect could be detected with increasing dose, duration or time since cessation.",
            "Table 2 displays the IRR and CI for the tobacco products separately and the association with BMI.",
            "Again, we found no effect of any of the different smoking tobacco products on the risk of developing CSCC.",
            "Pure cigarette smokers had an IRR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.85\u20131.26), pure cigar smokers 0.88 (95% CI 0.45\u20131.71) and pure pipe smokers 0.81 (95% CI 0.62\u20131.05) compared to nontobacco users.",
            "No dose\u2013response trends were revealed.",
            "Snuff use was found to be negatively associated with the risk of developing CSCC (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44\u20130.95).",
            "This effect was even stronger among those who had used snuff for more than 30 years.",
            "Subjects categorised as underweight, overweight or obese were not at an increased risk of CSCC compared to those of normal weight.",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "Our main finding is that the use of tobacco smoking is not associated with an increased risk of CSCC, although we found a negative association between oral moist snuff and CSCC risk.",
            "The potential impact of occupational sunlight exposure on CSCC in this cohort has been evaluated previously and no association was found, perhaps because outdoor workers wear protective clothing while working.",
            "Unfortunately, we do not have information on recreational sun habits among the cohort members.",
            "Previous investigations have reported relative risks of 1.5\u20134.1 between cigarette smoking and CSCC, whereas others found no such association.",
            "In general, most studies have been case\u2013control in design, focused only on cigarette smoking and used rather crude exposure measures; previous cohort studies were unable to study skin cancer since they mainly used mortality instead of incidence data.",
            "In the few studies of pipe and cigar smoking and BMI as risk factors of CSCC, pipe smoking and underweight have been associated with elevated risk of CSCC in contrast to our results.",
            "No studies have specifically addressed the impact of snuff use on CSCC.",
            "The major strengths of this study of Swedish construction workers are its large size, the prospective collection of exposure details and almost complete follow-up.",
            "Any residual misclassification would presumably be nondifferential and would not have any major impact on the findings."

            "Among 205 eligible ICC cases, the distribution by FIGO stage was the following: stage 1: 10.2%; stage 2: 44.9%; stage 3: 38.5%; stage 4: 6.3%. Squamous-cell carcinoma was diagnosed in 193 cases and adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma in 12.",
            "In all, 12 cancer cases refused to provide cervical samples, although they were willing to be interviewed, leaving a total of 193 cervical cancer patients with cervical exfoliated cells available for HPV testing.",
            "Control women were identified at the Cancer Institute among in-patients and visitors of patients other than women with cervical cancer, and were frequency matched by age with ICC cases within 5 years age groups.",
            "Exclusion criteria for control women included: (1) a diagnosis of anogenital tract cancers (i.e. cervix, vagina, vulva, anal canal), cancer of the breast, endometrium, ovary or colon, benign genital tumours and tobacco-related diseases (e.g. coronary heart disease, lung cancer or chronic bronchitis); (2) a history of hysterectomy or cervical conisation; and, as for ICC cases, (3) physical or mental problems.",
            "A total of 179 visitors and 37 in-patients were thus contacted.",
            "Of the eligible 216 controls, three declined to participate in the study and three refused to have a gynaecological examination.",
            "Thus, a sample of exfoliated cells from the cervix was available for 210 control women.",
            "Data and specimen collection",
            "Each participant was administered a standardised questionnaire on socioeconomic status, sexual behaviour, reproductive history, contraceptive practices, smoking habits, genital hygiene, history of sexually transmitted infections and cervical cytological screening.",
            "Questions on weekly consumption of 21 foods or food groups, and summary questions on overall consumption of all vegetables and fruits were included.",
            "Information on height (cm) at time of interview and weight (kg) 2 years before interview was self-reported.",
            "Two trained female interviewers administered the questionnaire to all case and control women in the hospital.",
            "After the interview, each consenting woman had a pelvic examination performed by a gynaecologist, who took two cervical scrapes with two Ayre spatulas and one endocervical brush.",
            "A Papanicolaou smear was prepared, and the remaining cells were eluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pelleted in PBS (2000\u2009r.p.m. for 20\u2009min at room temperature), and then stored at \u221270\u00b0C.",
            "A punch biopsy sample from the tumour (cases only) and a 10-ml sample of peripheral blood were also collected and stored at \u221270\u00b0C.",
            "The study was approved by the ethical review committees of the IARC in Lyon and the Cancer Institute in Chennai.",
            "Detection of HPV DNA",
            "To analyse the quality of target DNA, beta (\u03b2)-globin gene-specific primers were used.",
            "\u03b2-Globin-negative and HPV-negative samples (i.e. two ICC cases and 26 control women) were considered inadequate and excluded from HPV-related analyses, thus leaving 191 invasive cancer cases (179 squamous-cell carcinoma cases and 12 adeno/adenosquamous carcinoma cases) and 184 control women with adequate HPV-DNA results.",
            "The presence of HPV DNA in cervical cells was assessed using general primer-mediated GP5+/6+ PCR.",
            "Polymerase chain-reaction positivity was assessed by means of hybridisation of PCR products in an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using two HPV oligoprobe cocktails that together detect the following 36 HPV types: HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 6, 11, 26, 34, 40, 42, 43, 44, 53, 54, 55, 57, 61, 70, 71 (equivalent to CP8061), 72, 73, 81 (equivalent to CP8304), 82 (IS39 and MM4 subtypes), 83 (equivalent to MM7), 84 (equivalent to MM8) and CP 6108.",
            "Probes and procedures used for EIA detection are described elsewhere.",
            "In addition, HPV-positivity was assessed by low-stringency Southern blot analysis of PCR products with a cocktail probe of HPV-specific DNA fragments.",
            "Subsequently, GP5+/6+ PCR was repeated on positive samples in triplicate to generate sufficient products for further typing.",
            "After pooling these PCR products, typing was performed using EIA and HPV type-specific oligoprobes for the HPV types described above.",
            "Finally, E7 open-reading frame type-specific PCR assays for 14 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68) were applied to five ICC case specimens that were positive for \u03b2-globin but negative for HPV DNA by GP5+/GP6+ PCR.",
            "Reamplification of specimens with E7 was not done among control women, since integration of HPV DNA in the cellular genoma, and, therefore, loss or disruption of HPV L1 open-reading frame should not be found in women without cervical cancer.",
            "Statistical analyses",
            "To estimate the risk of cervical cancer associated with various HPV types and the other risk factors, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by unconditional logistic regression.",
            "The ORs were adjusted for age and area of residence (Chennai and out of Chennai), education level, occupation, marital status, age at first marriage (which nearly always coincided with age at first sexual intercourse), number of pregnancies and husband's extramarital affairs, as indicated in the Tables.",
            "Only 4.9% of cases and 1.4% of control women reported more than one lifetime sexual partner and zero cases and 1.4% of control women reported oral contraceptive use.",
            "Therefore, these two variables were not included in the models.",
            "Approximate tertiles of weight, height, body mass index (BMI, weight\u2009kg/height, m2), and intake of foods or food groups were computed based on the combined distribution of cases and controls.",
            "Tests for linear trend were performed assigning an increasing score for each level of categorical variables.",
            "Scores were then fitted into the model as a continuous variable.",
            "In order to elucidate the influence of HPV infection, major analyses were repeated: (1) among all cases and controls, (2) among HPV-positive vs HPV-negative control women, and (3) among HPV-positive cases vs HPV-positive control women only.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Table 1 )shows the distribution of 205 cases of cervical carcinoma and 213 control women according to selected characteristics.",
            "Only one case was found to be HPV-DNA negative and the OR for HPV-DNA positivity was 388.",
            "The vast majority of HPV infections involved high-risk HPV types and no cases and 11 control women were infected only with low-risk types (data not shown).",
            "Cervical cancer cases reported a lower education level than control subjects (OR=2.7 for no education vs secondary school or more).",
            "Approximately half of the cases and controls combined reported to work in agriculture, and farmers showed an OR of 4.3 compared with housewives.",
            "Being a widow or divorced rather than currently married (OR=8.1), having had \u2a7e5 vs 1\u20132 pregnancies (OR=5.0), and reporting that one's husband had had (or probably had) extramarital affairs (OR=7.0) were associated with significantly increased risk of cervical cancer (Table 1).",
            "In respect to paan chewing habits, 18.5% of cancer cases and 7.0% of control women reported to be ever chewers (OR=2.3; 95% CI: 1.0\u20135.3) (Table 2 ).",
            "The majority of chewers used paan with tobacco.",
            "No substantial difference in the ORs was found according to the presence of tobacco in paan.",
            "Women who reported to chew five or more paans per day showed a more elevated OR (4.0; 95% CI: 1.2\u201313.3) than women who reported less than 5 paans per day (1.4; 95% CI: 0.5\u20134.1) (\u03c72 for trend=5.08, P=0.02).",
            "Two cases and no controls reported to have ever smoked (Table 2).",
            "The mean weight was 52 and 54\u2009kg among cases and controls, respectively.",
            "Women who weighted less than 50\u2009kg had an OR of 1.9 compared with women who weighted 55\u2009kg or more (\u03c721 for trend=3.72, P<0.06).",
            "A nonsignificant inverse association was found also for height (OR for <1.51 vs >1.54\u2009m=1.7; \u03c721 for trend=2.56, P=0.11).",
            "Table 3  shows ORs by intake tertile of selected foods or food groups and cervical cancer.",
            "Significant inverse associations emerged for pulses (OR in the highest vs lowest intake tertile=0.4)and bananas (OR=0.3).",
            "The inverse associations with intake of fresh tomatoes, carrots, cruciferae and other citrus fruit were not statistically significant.",
            "There was no indication that the consumption of green vegetables, apples or pears, rice, milk, yogurt, egg, fish, meat, cakes or desserts and various oils affected ICC risk.",
            "A direct association was found for the intake of bread (OR=2.0).",
            "Table 4  shows the associations between ICC and paan chewing, BMI and overall vegetable and fruit intake according to the fully adjusted model in three different types of comparisons (see Statistical Analyses).",
            "Among all study women, paan chewing (ever vs never OR=2.4) and vegetable and fruit intake (summary question) (highest vs lowest intake tertile OR=0.5) were associated with ICC risk.",
            "In the analyses restricted to HPV-positive women, however, only the association with low vegetable and fruit intake (OR=0.4) was confirmed, even if it became of borderline statistical significance.",
            "Conversely, paan chewing was not related to ICC risk among HPV-positive women but showed a hint of direct association with HPV infection among control women.",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "This is the first report of an association between paan chewing and cervical cancer.",
            "The topic is of interest in the light of the well-established association between ICC and tobacco smoking.",
            "The mechanisms involved in the tobacco-cervical cancer link are not well understood, but some of them (e.g. high concentration of nicotine, cotinine and tobacco-specific nitrosamines in cervical mucus, impairment of immune function, accumulation of free radicals, etc,) may not require tobacco burning.",
            "Aqueous extracts of betel quids and arecanuts that are generally used to make paan produced carcinomas of the cheek pouch and fore-stomach of rodents after subcutaneous or intragastric administration.",
            "Chewing is common among women in South-East Asia and the South Pacific Islands where cervical cancer rates are very high, and, in Southern India, paan chewing has been found to account for 87% of oral cancer in women.",
            "In addition to paan chewing, low education, occupation in farming, low weight and low intake of vegetables and fruit were risk factors for cervical cancer in our study.",
            "An excess of cervical cancer among low socioeconomic class women is one of the most consistent findings of epidemiological studies on this tumour.",
            "Although the socioeconomic gradient in cervical cancer is now chiefly attributed to a lack of adequate screening, it has been present long before the spread of Papanicolaou smears in developed countries and must have explanations other than screening in our study since only one woman (a case) in Chennai reported to have ever had a Papanicolaou smear.",
            "A possible correlate of low social class is poor nutritional status.",
            "The inverse relation we found between ICC risk and vegetable and fruit intake, after allowing for education level and occupation, may support this possibility.",
            "Although we tried to obtain a woman's weight 2 years before cancer diagnosis or interview (controls), the apparent adverse effect of weight and BMI must be interpreted with caution, as it may be a consequence rather than a risk factor for cervical cancer.",
            "The findings on height, although not statistically significant, point to a possible influence of nutritional deficiencies in childhood and adolescence that might have prevented some women from attaining their full height.",
            "Unfortunately, the reliability of self-reported weight and height in India is unknown.",
            "Our present evaluation of dietary habits also has limitations, since we have been using a short frequency questionnaire that included 21 indicator foods or food groups only and we did not explore serving size.",
            "Furthermore, the questionnaire had not been validated in India, and it was especially difficult to capture any association with staple foods like rice, which are eaten daily by the majority of the population, and with food groups which are eaten rarely (e.g, apples or pears and citrus fruit) or as ingredients of complex recipes (e.g, meat, green vegetables).",
            "No reliable translation into specific macro- and micronutrients has been possible, but in the summary questions on overall intake of all vegetables and fruit, ICC cases did report a significantly lower intake than control women, in agreement with findings of some previous reports.",
            "The greatest challenge in the interpretation of our findings is, however, to rule out the possibility that the observed associations with paan chewing and low vegetable and fruit intake are not mere correlates of sexual habits and, most important, HPV infection.",
            "These associations were somewhat weakened, but were still statistically significant after adjustment for their possible mutual confounding effect and for all the major correlates of ICC risk in our study.",
            "HPV infection was found in all but one case and 28% of controls, and it involved, in the vast majority of women, high-risk HPV types.",
            "The separate analysis of risk factors for HPV infection (among control women only) and for cervical cancer among HPV-positive cases and HPV-positive controls can help to elucidate whether these influence chiefly the acquisition and persistence of HPV infection or the progression from HPV infection into malignant cervical lesions.",
            "The comparison of ORs in Table 4 suggests that low intake of vegetables and fruit is unrelated to HPV infection, but is directly associated with ICC risk among HPV-positive women.",
            "These findings are in agreement with those of and, who reported no association between intake of various vitamins and HPV infection.",
            "Paan chewing showed some, although nonsignificant, association with the prevalence of HPV infection among controls, but no association with ICC risk among HPV-positive women.",
            "A case\u2013control study from the United Kingdom showed that tobacco smoking was associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III among HPV-positive women, but not with HPV-positivity among control women.",
            "Unfortunately, the subgroup analyses in our study are based on small numbers of women and have very broad confidence intervals.",
            "However, the analyses restricted to HPV-positive women support the possibility that low intake of vegetables and fruit contributes to the progression from HPV infection to cervical cancer.",
            "With respect to paan chewing, either its adverse effect on cervical cancer is real and, possibly, mediated by a decreased ability of women who chew to clear HPV infection, or the habit of chewing is a surrogate marker for increased HPV exposure.",
            "Future prospective studies could evaluate the influence of paan chewing in the natural history of HPV infection and the development of preinvasive cervical lesions."

            "Combining the first 2 categories of each of the metrics in Supplementary Table S3 for the Australian study greatly reduced the OR: for cumulative exposure> 2.93\u2009p.p.m.-years (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 0.71, 4.36) and reduced the ORs in all categories in the other metrics while showing the same patterns.",
            "Those who had ever worked in a refinery in the Australian study showed similar patterns of results compared with those who had never worked in a refinery (Table 2), although generally ORs were much higher in those who had ever worked in a refinery.",
            "Discussion",
            "Overall, this study did not show a strong or consistent relationship between benzene exposure and AML or CLL.",
            "The study has high quality, precise benzene exposure estimates for individual participants, tailored to their job title, site and era and high quality diagnoses.",
            "Key components of the study analysis were replicated and confirmed by a second independent analyst.",
            "Potential limitations include small numbers in some subgroup analyses, no information on potential confounders, such as alcohol use, radiation exposure and genetic susceptibility, and a paucity of smoking data.",
            "Consistently elevated risks of about 1.5 for AML and smoking suggest smoking is not a potent confounder.",
            "The lack of a strong relationship between AML and benzene exposure differed from the original studies, which had some patterns of increased risk, particularly in the Australian study.",
            "A strong relationship of AML with high exposures to benzene has been shown.",
            "We found lower ORs for AML than for MDS, where a strong dose\u2013response relationship with benzene was found.",
            "This may reflect the fact that our exposures were generally low; they are similar to typical current European and North American exposures of \u2a7d1\u2009p.p.m..",
            "Our tertiles of cumulative exposure, defined as \u2a7d0.348, 0.348\u20132.93, >2.93\u2009p.p.m.-years, are much lower than the low cumulative exposure category of <40\u2009p.p.m.-years in (meta-OR: 1.94, 95% CI: 0.95, 3.95) and those found in studies such as the Pliofilm and Chinese occupational studies.",
            "Some AMLs from our earlier studies were reclassified to MDS or myeloproliferative disease (MPD) after examination of pathology information; MDS and MPD can progress to AML.",
            "Before ICD-10, MDS and MPD were not available diagnostic categories and many of our cases occurred before this, particularly in the older UK study; the more recent Australian cases were more likely to have been correctly identified.",
            "In contrast to the patterns for MDS the AML results were not consistent across the three studies, although risks for tanker drivers and in particular at terminals were similarly raised in the two diseases.",
            "The patterns for CLL tended to be different between the three studies with the Australian study showing increased risk in several analyses and particularly for refinery work (similar to the earlier Australian nested case-control).",
            "Elevated CLL mortality has previously been identified in refinery populations (.",
            "CLL is considered a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), as both are lymphoid cell malignancies.",
            "A review of 68 industrial studies reported several elevated findings for lymphoid cancers (CLL, NHL, multiple myeloma) for rubber workers and cohorts exposed to multiple chemicals.",
            "Possibly a more complex environment such as a refinery compared with terminals might tend to show an increased risk for lymphoid tumours such as CLL.",
            "Conclusion",
            "While some patterns among terminal workers, who tend to have a relatively high benzene exposure, suggest a relationship between AML and benzene, the overall evidence does not persuasively demonstrate a risk between benzene and AML.",
            "However, exposures in this study may have been too low to observe this.",
            "There was a general lack of association between benzene and CLL; the tendency for higher risks to occur in refinery workers may point to a role of more diverse exposures.",

            "Host genomic abnormalities may determine the natural history of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs).",
            "We undertook comparative genomic hybridisation analysis of epithelium carefully microdissected from 70 cervical SILs, the largest series to date.",
            "In contrast to previous studies, we used frozen sections for optimal DNA quality and examined whether patterns of DNA copy number imbalance (CNI) are characteristic of SIL grade, human papillomavirus (HPV) status and postoperative recurrence.",
            "We identified more CNIs in cervical SIL than previously described, with more CNIs per case in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HG-SIL) than in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LG-SIL) (P=0.04).",
            "While some CNIs were seen at similar frequencies in HG-SIL and LG-SIL, others, including gain on 1q, 3q and 16q, were found frequently in HG-SIL but not in LG-SIL.",
            "There were significantly more CNIs per case in HG-SILs showing loss of the HPV16 E2 gene (a repressor of viral oncogene transcription) (P=0.026) and in HG-SILs that subsequently recurred (P=0.04).",
            "Our data are consistent with sequential acquisition of CNIs in cervical SIL progression.",
            "Higher frequency of CNI in association with E2 gene loss supports in vitro evidence that high-risk HPV integration is associated with genomic instability.",
            "Further investigation of the clinical value of specific host genomic abnormalities in cervical SIL is warranted.",
            "Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) usually arises from a subset of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HG-SIL), which in turn are thought to arise from a subset of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LG-SIL).",
            "Untreated SILs have the potential to regress, persist or progress, and up to 8.6% of SILs recur locally following complete excision.",
            "However, the molecular pathology of cervical SILs is poorly understood and it is currently not possible to predict the natural history of an individual lesion.",
            "Unnecessary follow-up of women with cervical SILs destined not to progress or recur imposes large burdens on colposcopy services worldwide and produces substantial adverse psychosocial consequences for individual patients.",

            "Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is known to be an independent risk factor for progression of LG-SIL to HG-SIL and for the development of SCC.",

            "These studies have generally suggested that relatively few copy number imbalances (CNIs) exist in SIL.",
            "However, such data should be interpreted with caution, since all studies used formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, in which DNA degradation may cause difficulties with CGH, and cells microdissected under histological control do not appear to have been analysed in all studies.",
            "Moreover, one study combined cases equivalent to LG-SIL with cases equivalent to HG-SIL and another examined SIL adjacent to SCC, which may not represent typical SIL.",

            "We reasoned that any abnormalities present at similar frequencies in LG-SIL and HG-SIL might represent early events in the pathogenesis of SIL, while abnormalities present at a higher frequency in HG-SIL than in LG-SIL might reflect those involved in disease progression.",

            "In HG-SILs containing HPV16, the HPV type most frequently associated with cervical SCC, we examined associations between CNIs and the presence or absence of the HPV16 E2 and E7 genes, as detected by PCR.",
            "We aimed to identify cases in which HPV16 E2 was lost but HPV16 E7 was retained, as these cases would be expected to show derepression of HR-HPV oncogenes.",
            "Previous validation studies using Southern blotting had shown that such E2-negative/E7-positive cases contained HPV16 integrants in the absence of HPV16 episomes.",
            "The E2/E7 PCR technique was employed, as the microdissected samples did not yield sufficient quantities of genomic DNA (gDNA) and RNA to enable us to use optimal techniques for assessment of HR-HPV integration, such as restriction site PCR or amplification of papillomavirus oncogene transcripts.",

            "We have identified more CNIs per case than previously reported in SIL.",
            "We observed a median of four CNIs per case in LG-SIL and six CNIs per case in HG-SIL, compared, for example, to a mean of 1.1 CNIs per case in lesions equivalent to LG-SIL and a mean of 4.1 CNIs per case in lesions equivalent to HG-SIL in a previous report.",
            "Our study has the advantages of using frozen sections of cervical SILs (unaccompanied by SCC) from which the lesional epithelium was microdissected, which may allow for greater sensitivity in detecting CNIs.",
            "On the other hand, it should be noted that the thresholds used for determination of copy number gain and loss have been greater in previous studies of cervical SIL.",
            "Our data indicate that certain recurrent CNIs occur in both cervical LG-SIL and HG-SIL and suggest that there may also be sequential acquisition of imbalances during the progression from LG-SIL to HG-SIL.",
            "While the CNIs that occur at similar frequencies in LG-SIL and HG-SIL are consistent with early events, those that are significantly more frequent in HG-SIL may confer a selective advantage to LG-SIL cells and contribute to progression via clonal selection.",
            "Alternatively, the latter CNIs may represent an advantageous consequence of increased chromosomal instability in HG-SIL and be of greater relevance in favouring subsequent progression to SCC.",
            "CGH losses reported here are consistent with sites of allelic imbalance previously reported in cervical SIL and SCC, including 3p12\u20133p14.1, 4p16, 4q21\u2013q35, 6p14\u201322, 6q22\u2013q27, 9p21, 11p14\u201315 and 11q23.",
            "Further investigation of these sites of potential tumour suppressor genes is warranted.",
            "We observed gain of 3q in 20% of 51 HG-SIL cases.",
            "Whereas this imbalance was initially described as defining the transition to SCC in the cervix, it was subsequently reported in eight of 37 (22%) paraffin-embedded \u2018dysplastic\u2019 lesions equivalent to HG-SIL, an observation that is supported by our data.",
            "Interestingly, we found that six of the 10 HG-SILs in our study that showed gain of 3q also showed loss on 3p or 13q, also supporting the previous suggestion of an association between these abnormalities.",
            "Our findings are consistent with the earlier identification of 3q25\u2013q27 as the consensus region of gain.",
            "Cases of HPV16-positive HG-SIL in which the E2 gene was disrupted showed significantly more CNIs and significantly more frequent gain on 3q than cases in which the E2 gene was intact.",
            "Data from the PCR approach that we used to detect E2 and E7 have previously been shown to correlate with the physical state of HPV in clinical specimens, as determined by Southern blotting.",
            "Loss of E2 (with retention of E7) is consistent with the presence of integrated HPV16 in the absence of HPV16 episomes.",
            "The presence of the HPV16 E2 gene could either be due to episomal HPV16 or to integrated HPV16 in which the gene is retained, for example, following concatamerisation of the integrants.",
            "Our finding that the E2 gene was disrupted in 14 of 23 (61%) testable HG-SILs is consistent with previous PCR data.",
            "Greater chromosomal instability following loss of the E2 gene is likely to be associated with derepression of the HPV16 oncogenes E7 and E6, which can cooperate in the induction of mitotic defects and genomic instability.",
            "For some cases at least, loss of HR-HPV E2 may therefore be a significant intermediate step in cervical oncogenesis, occurring between infection with HR-HPV and the development of chromosomal instability.",
            "Indeed, these data support our recent in vitro observations that integration of HPV16 in cervical keratinocytes, with disruption of the E2 gene as is typically seen in vivo, is closely associated with the development of high-level genomic instability.",
            "On the other hand, our identification in the present study of cases of HG-SIL that retain the HPV16 E2 gene yet show numerous CNIs (e.g. case H38, with 15 aberrant arms) is consistent with the notion that loss of E2 function is not essential for chromosomal instability to develop in cervical keratinocytes.",
            "It should be noted, however, that the low cell yield provided by the microdissection approach that we chose to adopt did not enable us to assess levels of E2 gene expression in the samples that we examined.",
            "Moreover, because of clonal heterogeneity within SILs, cells containing the E2 gene may have been different to those showing numerous CNIs.",
            "Of the 46 cases of HG-SIL in our study with histologically clear excision margins and adequate follow-up data, six (13%) recurred.",
            "This rate of local recurrence is broadly similar to that described by other authors.",
            "HG-SILs destined to recur showed significantly more CNIs and significantly more frequent loss of 4q and 5q than HG-SILs that did not recur.",
            "Our observations were made on relatively small numbers of cases, using a whole genome approach that would not be appropriate for routine clinical use.",
            "However, our data support the notion that detection of one or more specific host cell abnormalities (either alone or in combination with tests of HPV type, physical state, etc.) may ultimately prove to be of value in risk stratification and clinical management of cervical SILs.",
            "It is likely that shared risk factors underlie the association that we have observed between the number of CNIs in HG-SIL and lesional recurrence despite complete local excision.",
            "Most important may be viral factors, such as persistence and integration of HR-HPV.",
            "However, there may also be a role for host genetic polymorphisms, such as those affecting TP53 or local host immunity, and/or environmental factors such as smoking, local hormonal effects and other sexually transmitted diseases.",
            "In summary, we have obtained molecular cytogenetic data that are consistent with a model of sequential acquisition of genomic CNIs in the development and progression of cervical SIL.",

            "Indeed, pooling the odds ratios from all case-control studies published to date suggests that smoking could increase the risk of AML by about 20% (Table 3).",
            "This increase is similar to those reported in previous meta-analyses (Brownson et al, 1993;Siegel, 1993).",
            "However, these estimates should be treated cautiously since there is strong evidence of heterogeneity between studies, possibly arising from heterogeneous populations and/ or different study designs (Hardy and Thompson, 1998).",
            "Interestingly, the pooled risk estimate changes little when only population-based case-control studies (Severson, 1987;Severson et al, 1990;Brown et al, 1992a;Sandler et al, 1993; and the present study) are considered, despite there being less evidence of heterogeneity (\u03c7 2 = 4.99, P = 0.29).",

            "Indeed, only one case-control study of comparable size to the present has been published, with a risk estimate and 95% confi-dence interval (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.8-2.0) similar to the result reported here (Sandler et al, 1993).",
            "This suggests that the increased risk from smoking for ALL may be similar to that for AML.",
            "Dose-response relationships for AML and ALL have previously been evaluated using the number of cigarettes consumed per day (Kabat et al, 1988;Brownson, 1989;Severson et al, 1990;Brownson et al, 1991;Brown et al, 1992a;Crane et al, 1992;Friedman, 1993), the number of years smoked (Severson, 1987;Severson et al, 1990;Brown et al, 1992a;Friedman, 1993), or pack-years (Severson et al, 1990;Crane et al, 1992;Sandler et al, 1993;Mele et al, 1994).",
            "While the majority of studies found no evidence of a trend in risk with number of cigarettes smoked per day (Kabat et al, 1988;Brownson, 1989;Brownson et al, 1991;Brown et al, 1992a;Crane et al, 1992), significant increasing trends with increasing number of years smoked were found in two studies (Severson, 1987;Severson et al, 1990).",
            "More consistent with this study were the relatively constant odds ratios for AML with years smoked observed in another study (Brown et al, 1992a).",
            "Although significant increasing trends of pack-years were reported in previous studies (Severson et al, 1990;Sandler et al, 1993;Mele et al, 1994), it was felt that for the current analysis pack-years were inappropriate as not only does this variable not account for time with respect to diagnosis, it also accrues errors resulting from recall bias.",

            "This difference probably reflects the fact that, like others (Smith and Doll, 1982;Curtis et al, 1984;Aksoy, 1985;Rinsky et al, 1987), we lagged the exposure data 2 years before diagnosis, partly to account for latency and partly because of concerns about changing habits as the illness onsets.",
            "Hence, individuals who gave up smoking within the 2 years leading up to diagnosis would have been classified as a current smoker in our study and as an ex-smoker (even if given up in the week before diagnosis) in other studies (Severson et al, 1990;Brown et al, 1992a;Mele et al, 1994).",
            "One of these studies also suggested decreasing risks with increasing number of years since quit smoking, but this result was based on small numbers (Severson et al, 1990).",
            "The level of completeness of cases in this study is known to be high as all cases are registered on the Leukaemia Research Fund's Data Collection Study (Cartwright et al, 1997), which is estimated to be 98.5% complete for AML and ALL (McNally et al, 1997).",
            "Of more concern is the high number of non-participating subjects.",
            "Cases and controls who refused to participate tended to live in more deprived areas than interviewed subjects, and so were more likely to smoke (Hay and Foster, 1984;Bennett et al, 1996).",
            "As the refusal rate for controls is considerably higher than for cases, the resulting risk estimates may be overestimated.",
            "However, adjustment for deprivation did not alter the association of tobacco exposure and acute leukaemia (unadjusted OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4).",
            "A major problem with case-control studies of the type reported here is the retrospective collection of self-reported exposure information.",
            "As smoking is not a widely accepted cause of leukaemia, exaggeration of exposure by cases seems improbable.",
            "While under-reporting by controls cannot be ruled out, the smoking habits reported appear consistent with a sample of the general population (Bennett et al, 1996).",
            "For diseases with poor prognosis, a further problem surrounds the issue of surrogate interviews.",
            "If they are not attempted, then the completeness of the study is compromised.",
            "On the other hand, surrogate information about  factors such as smoking may be poor.",
            "Fortunately, the quick referral of cases into our study ensured that only a small proportion of interviews (13%) were with surrogates.",
            "Removing the few proxy interviews made little difference to the risk estimate for ever compared with never smoked (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5 based on 702 cases and 1385 controls), and the odds ratios for the number of years smoked and the number of years since quit were similarly unaffected (data not shown).",
            "As the effect of smoking on the risk of acute leukaemia appears to be comparatively small, confounding by other factors may be important.",
            "Evidence for other risk factors that could be related to smoking is, however, sparse and contradictory.",
            "Nonetheless, it is unfortunate that information on habits such as alcohol consumption (Williams and Horm, 1977;Jensen, 1979;Blackwelder et al, 1980;Hinds et al, 1980;Schmidt and Popham, 1981;Carstensen et al, 1990;Brown et al, 1992b) and variations in diet (Hursting et al, 1990;Kwiatkowski, 1993) were not collected in this study.",
            "While our increased risk could be confounded by other risk factors, a causal relationship between tobacco smoke and acute leukaemia seems plausible.",
            "Known or suspected leukaemogens, for example benzene, radioactive lead and polonium, nitrosamines and urethanes, are present in tobacco smoke.",
            "The levels of such chemicals in one packet of 20 cigarettes are considerably less than in some work environments, so it seems unlikely that any one chemical constituent of tobacco smoke could solely cause the increased risk of acute leukaemia.",
            "Although the biological mechanisms are unknown, tobacco smoke has been associated with chromosomal defects in the peripheral blood (Perera et al, 1987), immunological changes such as increases in the leucocyte count (Petitti and Kipp, 1986) and decreases in natural killer cell activity (Hersey et al, 1983); all factors that are linked to leukaemia (Heath, 1982).",
            "In addition, long-term use exacerbates such changes (Ghosh and Ghosh, 1987;Petitti and Kipp, 1986) while quitting results in a subsequent decline in the leucocyte count (Petitti and Kipp, 1986), an increase in natural killer cell activity (Hersey et al, 1983) and a decrease in DNA damage (Frenzilli et al, 1997).",
            "Hence, our observed increased risk of acute leukaemia with 10 or more years of tobacco use and a decline in the odds ratios with increasing number of years since stopping seems reasonable.",
            "In conclusion, AML was found to be associated with smoking, and the risk was greatest for those who smoked for 10 or more years and who were still smoking at 2 years before diagnosis.",
            "It appears that the risk of ALL from tobacco was no different to the risk of AML, but small numbers have hampered our investigation.",
            "Although no trend was observed for number of years smoked or number of cigarettes per day, there was evidence that the risk of acute leukaemia decreases on cessation of smoking.",

            "The cases were all children under 15 years of age diagnosed with leukaemia between 1st January 1990 and 31st December 2001 and living around nuclear sites at the time of diagnosis.",
            "The cases were provided by the French National Registry of Childhood Leukemia and Lymphoma, which registered 5330 cases of acute leukaemia from 1990 to 2001 for the mainland France.",
            "Eighty-one per cent of all the cases of acute leukaemia were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 17% were acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).",
            "The incidence of acute leukaemia among children aged <15 years varies markedly with age.",
            "In particular, ALL incidence shows a typical peak at age 2 years for girls and 3 for boys.",
            "Therefore, the analyses were also performed by age group (0\u20134, 5\u20139 and 10\u201314 years).",
            "The Chooz and Civaux nuclear power plants were connected to the grid in 1997 and 1999, respectively.",
            "Therefore, the childhood leukaemia cases around those two sites were taken into account from 1997 for Chooz and 1999 for Civaux.",
            "Expected numbers of cases",
            "Age- and gender-specific population counts by \u2018commune\u2019 (the smallest French administrative division), were derived from the national censuses of March 1990 and March 1999 provided by the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE).",
            "A \u2018d\u00e9partement\u2019 is an administrative geographic unit including 383 \u2018communes\u2019 on average.",

            "They were used to obtain age- and gender-specific population estimates from 1991 to 1998 and for years 2000 and 2001 for each \u2018commune\u2019.",
            "The number of person years for a given year and a given \u2018commune\u2019 were subsequently calculated using those estimates.",
            "National age- and gender-specific incidence rates for childhood leukaemia in France (1990\u20132001), based on the National Registry data, were used as reference rates to derive annual expected numbers of cases for each age group and \u2018commune\u2019 near nuclear sites.",
            "The annual expected numbers of cases were used to estimate SIR defined as the ratio of the observed over the expected number of cases.",
            "The exact 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for these ratios were given using a Poisson distribution.",
            "EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT",
            "The spatial distribution of the exposure of the population around French nuclear installations due to gaseous radioactive discharge has been assessed by the Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) using radionuclide discharge data, local climate data, and a mathematical model of nuclide transfers in the environment.",
            "Four types of installations were selected: nuclear power plants (NPP), nuclear fuel cycle plants (one fuel production facility, one site with a fuel conversion facility and a fuel enrichment facility), a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, and two research centres.",
            "All the 19 French NPPs have been taken into account.",
            "They include two to six reactors ranging from 900 electric megaWatts (MW) to 1450\u2009MW.",
            "For plants of other types (nuclear fuel cycle plants, nuclear fuel-reprocessing plant, research centres), only a few sites were selected to test the feasibility of the approach and its consistency with the available data.",
            "The selected nuclear fuel cycle plants include the nuclear fuel processing plant at Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re and the fuel conversion plant and the fuel-enrichment plant at Pierrelatte.",
            "Two nuclear research centres at Saclay and Cadarache were selected together with the La Hague nuclear fuel-reprocessing plant.",
            "Previous dose calculation work for the population living near the La Hague reprocessing plant has been carried out in France.",
            "Only the average dose delivered to the Beaumont-La Hague \u2018canton\u2019 (a geographic unit which, in this case, includes 10 \u2018communes\u2019) was determined.",
            "No zoning was carried out to differentiate the \u2018communes\u2019.",
            "For the NPPs, the average annual discharge levels and discharge compositions for recent years were determined for each of the two types of NPP, namely the 900\u2009MW and 1300\u2009MW NPPs.",
            "The discharges from the 1450\u2009MW Chooz and Civaux NPPs were assumed similar to the discharge from the 1300\u2009MW NPPs.",
            "The typical composition of NPP gaseous discharges was taken into account.",
            "The composition includes the following nuclides: tritium, carbon 14, argon 41, krypton 85, xenon 133, xenon 135, iodine 131, iodine 133, cobalt 58, cobalt 60, caesium 134 and caesium 137.",
            "Carbon 14 was not measured in the gaseous effluent of the French NPPs until very recently.",
            "Therefore, no discharge data on carbon 14 were available, and the levels were assumed equivalent to the limit specified in recent discharge permits for this radionuclide.",
            "The average discharge levels and compositions for a period of several years (3- to 5-year period, depending on the data available) were assessed for the other plants.",
            "Those levels and compositions were assumed to be representative of discharges for recent years (after 1995) and have been used as input data in the dose estimations.",
            "Local climate data on wind speed and direction, vertical stability of the atmosphere and rain frequency were used for each site when available.",
            "Data were collected from the documents submitted by operators in discharge authorisation applications.",
            "For a few nuclear plants, data on vertical stability and on rain frequency were not available and the national average data were used.",
            "The FOCON96 1.0 code was used to calculate the doses from routine discharge into the atmosphere.",
            "This code includes a model of gas and aerosol dispersion in the atmosphere.",
            "The model is based on a Gaussian model with the modelling of vertical and horizontal standard deviation developed by.",
            "The code also includes models of dry and wet deposition of aerosols on soil, grass and vegetable leaves.",
            "Wet deposition is based on a model of plume scavenging by the rain.",
            "The code takes into account root absorption of nuclides by vegetables and grass.",
            "Contamination of meat and milk is also modelled in the code.",
            "The default values of the transfer parameters proposed in the FOCON 96 code have been used.",
            "The main pathways have been taken into account: inhalation, ingestion (vegetables, meat and milk), external exposure from the plume (in the atmosphere or in the water) and deposits (aerosol deposition on the ground and sediment deposition on beaches or river banks).",
            "Protection by buildings was not taken into account in the assessment of external exposure.",
            "National average food consumption rates have been taken into account (INSEE, 1991).",
            "Only estimates of the local part of food production were taken into account (from national average data).",
            "It was assumed that 100% of the year was spent in the \u2018commune\u2019.",
            "The dose coefficient to RBM calculated by the was used for internal pathways and the US Federal Guidance dose coefficient for external exposure.",
            "Red bone marrow doses from gaseous discharge were estimated around each site on a polar grid (252 assessment points) around the stack with the FOCON 96 code.",
            "The doses were interpolated on a 250-m2 mesh using a SPLINE method (G3GRID procedure of the SAS\u00a9 software).",
            "The RBM dose for each \u2018commune\u2019 is the average of the four nearest mesh points around the town-hall of the \u2018commune\u2019.",
            "Areas under study",
            "The studied area was defined as all \u2018communes\u2019 located in 40\u2009km2 centred on 24 French nuclear installations.",
            "There are 36\u2009354 \u2018communes\u2019 in France with an average population per \u2018commune\u2019 of 1609 people.",
            "A total of 2107 French \u2018communes\u2019 were included in the study.",
            "A strict partition of the areas under study had to be maintained in order to ensure the statistical independence of the observations.",
            "Therefore, when study areas around two sites overlapped (this occurred for 68 \u2018communes\u2019), the \u2018communes\u2019 were assigned to the site for which the estimated RBM dose was the highest.",
            "The total RBM dose obtained by adding the RBM dose estimates for the two sites was then assigned to the \u2018commune\u2019 considered.",
            "Since the Tricastin NPP and Pierrelatte plant are very close to each other, they were considered as a single site throughout the study.",
            "This explains the reference to 23 sites (18 NPPs) rather than the original 24 sites (19 NPPs).",
            "All of the 2107 \u2018communes\u2019 were subsequently divided into five zones defined on the basis of the estimated dose.",
            "Each of the lowest two categories of estimated dose included approximately a tertile of the expected number of cases in order to obtain stable incidence estimates in each category.",
            "The corresponding arithmetic means were 0.021 and 0.057 microSievert per year (\u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121) , respectively.",
            "In order to cover the full range of variation of the estimated dose, the third category was then divided into three categories using a logarithmic scale.",
            "The corresponding arithmetic means were 0.141, 0.553 and 2.13\u2009\u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121, respectively.",
            "Each of the five categories was constructed as aggregations of the \u2018communes\u2019 whose estimated dose was within the limits of the category.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "The present study investigated for the existence of an increase in the SIR of childhood leukaemia with increasing estimated radiation dose due to gaseous discharge from nuclear sites.",
            "The following four tests were used: Fisher's \u03c72 test, the likelihood ratio test, a linear risk score test, and Stone's Poisson maximum test.",
            "Fisher's \u03c72 test and the likelihood ratio test based on the Poisson regression models were used to examine the heterogeneity of the five predefined categories of estimated dose.",
            "The linear risk score test and Stone's Poisson maximum test explicitly investigate for an increase in SIR with increasing estimated dose.",
            "The linear risk score test used was adapted from those used by and discussed by: for the test, each case is scored on the basis on the estimated dose of the \u2018commune\u2019 under consideration.",
            "The Stone's Poisson maximum test is based on the maximum value of the SIR as \u2018communes\u2019 ranked by increasing estimated dose are aggregated into a region of greater size.",
            "The latter two tests were applied to the five predefined dose-based categories and to the estimated dose considered quantitatively for each \u2018commune\u2019.",
            "The powers of the linear risk score tests and Stone's Poisson maximum test to detect a given risk pattern have been discussed by several authors.",
            "For all four tests, both an external and an internal reference were used.",
            "In the case of tests using an external reference, rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e. a uniform SIR of 1 irrespective of the estimated dose) might evidence the existence of a trend in the relative risk with the estimated dose, or might be due to an excess risk in the overall study area compared to the whole of France, which was considered as the external reference in the study.",
            "Using an internal reference enables only the distribution of cases within the study area to be considered and ignores the difference between the overall observed and expected numbers of cases around a given site.",
            "The 5% critical values and the P-values of the four test statistics were estimated using simulation methods with R-software.",
            "Under the null hypothesis of a uniform SIR of 1 irrespective of the estimated dose, the null distributions of the four tests were determined from 10\u2009000 simulations.",
            "The simulations were based on a Poisson distribution with expected values equal to the expected numbers of cases in the case of an external reference, or on a multinomial distribution with expected values proportional to the expected numbers of cases in the case of an internal reference.",
            "The 5% critical values and the P-values were then derived from the null distributions.",
            "The analyses were performed for the 23 sites, for all cases (0\u201314 years) and for the complete period (1990\u20132001), and then separately, by age group (0\u20134, 5\u20139 and 10\u201314 years), period (1990\u20131995, 1996\u20132001), and leukaemia type (ALL, AML).",
            "The 18 NPPs were analysed as a separate subgroup because of their common characteristics.",
            "The possible heterogeneity of the 23 sites led to a more detailed study of each site individually.",
            "Bonferroni's method was used in order to correct for multiple testing.",
            "RESULTS",
            "The estimated doses due to gaseous discharge in the 2107 \u2018communes\u2019 located in the vicinity of the 23 nuclear installations ranged from 0.06 to 1.33\u2009\u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121, with an arithmetic mean of 0.17\u2009\u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121, and a standard deviation of 0.48\u2009\u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121.",
            "Table 1 shows the distribution of the observed and expected numbers of childhood leukaemia cases and the SIRs by the above dose-based categories, for each of the 23 nuclear sites, for the 18 NPPs considered together and for the 23 sites considered together.",
            "The observed number of cases of childhood leukaemia within the study area (O=750) was lower than expected (E=795.01), but the difference was not statistically significant (SIR=0.94, 95% CI=[0.88\u20131.01]).",
            "Considering all 18 NPPs or all 23 sites, no evidence of heterogeneity between the five dose-based categories, and no trend toward an increase in SIR with increasing estimated dose, considered qualitatively or quantitatively, were found.",
            "The likelihood ratio test and Fisher's \u03c72 test showed significant heterogeneity of the 23 nuclear sites (P=0.025 and 0.027, respectively).",
            "A statistically significant excess of cases was observed for one plant (Chinon: O=20, SIR=1.83, 95% CI=[1.12\u20132.83]), and a statistically significant deficit of cases was found for two plants (Fessenheim: O=17, SIR=0.50, 95% CI=[0.29\u20130.80]; Pierrelatte/Tricastin: O=6, SIR=0.41, 95% CI=[0.15\u20130.90]).",
            "When Bonferroni's method was used to correct for multiple testing (23 comparisons), neither the excess nor the deficits remained significant.",
            "The overall tests are largely influenced by the Saclay site, which is located close to Paris and hence includes most of the cases.",
            "Therefore, the main analyses were also carried out on the 22 remaining sites excluding Saclay.",
            "There were 292 cases of childhood leukaemia compared to an expected number of 310.88 (SIR=0.94, 95% CI=[0.83\u20131.05]).",
            "No evidence of either heterogeneity between the five dose-based categories or a trend toward an increase in SIR with increasing estimated dose considered qualitatively or quantitatively, was found.",
            "None of the 23 sites showed any statistical evidence of a SIR trend with increasing estimated dose, or of heterogeneity between the five dose-based categories.",
            "A likelihood ratio test based on Poisson regression models did not show any statistically significant heterogeneity for the slopes of the relationship between estimated dose and childhood leukaemia incidence estimated for each of the 23 sites separately (P=0.46).",
            "The common estimation of these slopes was not significantly different from 0: exp\u03b2\u0302=0.83 per \u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121 (95% CI=[0.58\u20131.20]) where \u03b2\u0302 is the regression coefficient associated to the estimated dose.",
            "Table 2 shows the distribution of the observed and expected numbers of childhood leukaemia cases and the SIRs by category of estimated dose for age groups 0\u20134, 5\u20139 and 10\u201314 years.",
            "No evidence of either heterogeneity between the five dose-based categories or a trend towards an increase in SIR with increasing estimated dose considered qualitatively or quantitatively, was found for any of the three age groups, when all 18 NPPs, all 23 sites or only 22 sites were considered.",
            "There was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity between the five dose-based categories or of a trend towards an increase in SIR with increasing estimated dose, considered qualitatively or quantitatively, for any of the periods (1990\u20131995, 1996\u20132001), or for any of the leukaemia types (ALL, AML), when all 18 NPPs or all 23 sites were considered.",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "The observed number of cases of acute leukaemia (O=750) in 40\u2009km2 centred on the 23 French nuclear installations between 1990 and 2001 was lower than expected (E=795.01), but not significantly so (SIR=0.94, 95% CI=[0.88\u20131.01]).",
            "In none of the five zones defined on the basis of the estimated dose due to gaseous discharges was the SIR significantly greater than 1.0.",
            "There was no evidence of an increasing trend in SIR with increasing estimated dose for all children or for any of the three age groups studied.",
            "The present study focused on developing a zoning method based on dose level order of magnitude using the same model for all nuclear installations.",
            "Inaccurate dose estimation cannot be excluded but since the same methodology was used for all sites, if the model or generic parameters were erroneous, the estimated doses would be uniformly raised or reduced; the geographic zoning would thus remain similar and the trend results would be unchanged.",
            "Conversely, inaccuracies related to the characteristics of each site, especially those related to local climate data, may have resulted in geographic zoning.",
            "However, climatologic data are derived from multiyear measurements and are not likely to be significantly inaccurate.",
            "The geographic zoning derived from dose estimates used in the present study is therefore considered not to be seriously erroneous.",
            "The dose estimates were based on a simple method.",
            "In particular, discharge has been assumed to occur at ground level for NPPs because the stacks are only a few meters higher than buildings (wake effect on the plume).",
            "For NPPs, insufficient data on the real discharge rates of carbon 14 were available.",
            "In consequence, relatively high rates for the discharge of carbon 14 by NPPs were assumed: the regulatory limits for discharge rates.",
            "This is likely to overestimate the contribution of carbon 14 to the estimated dose.",
            "The doses were estimated for adults because a sensitivity analysis showed that the estimated dose was rather similar for all the ages considered.",
            "The method of dose estimation was based on recent discharge rate data from the late nineties.",
            "As discharges generally show a sharp decrease with time, these data may lead to an underestimation of the doses compared to those associated to past discharges.",
            "On the other hand, the data are characteristic of the period 1996\u20132000, which approximately corresponds to the period of leukaemia diagnosis (1990\u20132001).",
            "Further contributions to the total dose of radiation may be taken into account from direct radiation and liquid discharges.",
            "Direct radiation is minor around the French nuclear installations and can be neglected.",
            "Doses due to liquid discharges are possibly of the same order of magnitude as those from gaseous discharges, but may be considered homogeneous at the geographic scale used for gaseous discharges.",
            "Liquid-discharge doses depend on factors that are not subject to local borders, that is agricultural habits, food harvesting and distribution channels, and individual behaviour (bathing, fishing, consumption of food contaminated by irrigation from waterways).",
            "In consequence, the doses from liquid discharges could not be estimated in the present study, but the doses from gaseous discharges are considered to classify \u2018communes\u2019 correctly.",
            "Moreover, the results of the analyses were unchanged when the type of environment (sea, river, pool, etc.) of the nuclear sites under study was taken into account.",
            "The epidemiological studies of the incidence of leukaemia around nuclear sites analysed incidence as a function of the distance from the sites.",
            "However, the dispersion of the radionuclides is generally not isotropic, the estimated dose does not decrease linearly with the distance and dose levels are not equal for all sites.",
            "The method of zoning used in the present study enables estimation of the real geographic distribution of the carcinogen dose (ionising radiation) in the environment.",
            "The zones defined by dose assessments were very different from concentric circles around the plants due to topographic and meteorological characteristics.",
            "The estimated dose and distance were significantly negatively correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient \u03c1=\u22120.58, P<10\u22124), but marked variability in the estimated dose within each concentric band (0\u20135, 5\u201310, 10\u201315, 15\u201320\u2009km) remained.",
            "The contrast in the mean dose between the lowest and highest dose-based categories (range: 2.11\u2009\u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121; ratio: 106) was much larger than the maximum contrast between the concentric bands 0\u20135 and 15\u201320\u2009km (range: 1.16\u2009\u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121; ratio: 30).",
            "The estimated dose attributable to gaseous discharge delivered to the population was very small for all \u2018communes\u2019 located in 40\u2009km2 centred on the nuclear sites considered (mean dose <0.20\u2009\u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121 and maximum value about a few microSievert per year).",
            "According to current knowledge on the effects of exposure to ionising radiation, no observable effect associated to such low doses is expected.",
            "The absence of excess risk or trend associated to the doses due to routine discharge from the plants is not surprising.",
            "In comparison, the RBM dose due to natural sources of exposure (including radon, terrestrial and cosmic gamma radiation, and intake of natural radionuclides) has been estimated to be 2700\u2009\u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121 for children, and the dose due to medical examinations has been estimated to be approximately 740\u2009\u03bcSv\u2009y\u22121.",
            "The mean estimated RBM dose due to gaseous radioactive discharge for children living in the vicinity of nuclear installations is therefore approximately 1000 to 10\u2009000 times lower than the mean RBM dose due to natural sources.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "Most of the epidemiological studies of the incidence of leukaemia around nuclear sites analysed incidence as a function of the distance from the sites.",
            "In the present study, a dose-based zoning, rather than distance, was used for the first time in order to enhance the characterisation of the population's exposure.",
            "This approach has the advantage of considering the nonisotropic distribution of gaseous discharges in the environment.",
            "It also provides an illustration of the weakness of the doses due to routine discharges compared to other sources of exposure to ionising radiation.",
            "No evidence was found for a general increase or trend in the incidence of childhood leukaemia according to this zoning in the vicinity of the 23 French nuclear installations considered for the period 1990\u20132001."

            "Human papillomaviruses play a causal role in cervical cancer.",
            "Human papillomavirus infection is also detected in other cancers of the female lower genital tract, including cancers of vulva, vagina, and perineum.",
            "However, the role of HPV infection in the development of cancers in the upper genital tract, such as endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, is less clear.",
            "The first report on HPV infection in ovarian cancers was published in 1987, although the article was retacted 1 year later by the authors.",
            "To date about 16 additional reports on HPV infection in ovarian tumours were found in the MEDLINE.",
            "Among these, 10 analysed more than 10 tumour specimens in each report.",
            "Only in four of the 10 studies, HPV infection was found in ovarian cancers.",
            "It is interesting that in three of the positive reports, specimens of Chinese origin were used.",
            "In the present study, a total of 54 ovarian cancers and 30 nontumour ovarian specimens were analysed for the presence of HPV-16.",
            "Among the 50 epithelial ovarian cancers, a total of 26 (52%) HPV-16 positive were found.",
            "Our results are consistent with those reports based on Chinese origin specimens.",
            "These independent studies are from three areas of grand China, Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, suggesting that host genetic makeup may play an important role in susceptibility to HPV infection.",
            "Alternatively, HPV intratypic variants in different geographical regions may also determine the association with the risk of ovarian cancer.",
            "It has been reported that the distribution of HPV variants varied in different geographical areas, suggesting that the virus and the host have coevolved over time.",
            "Epidemiology studies in cervical cancers showed that individuals infected with a non-European variant of HPV-16 were associated with 2\u20139- fold increased risk of cervical cancer.",
            "Whether this is the case in ovarian cancer needs to be further investigated.",
            "In addition to the host and pathogen genetic variation, the difference of the detection methods employed in the studies might also account for data discrepancy.",
            "It has been well documented in cervical cancer that the episomal viral DNA frequently integrates into the host genome as HPV-infected lesions progress to cervical cancer.",
            "During viral DNA integration, only E6 and E7 genes remained in the host genome.",
            "Therefore, the presence of E6 or E7 genes in tumour tissues may better represent the real HPV infection.",
            "In some studies, L1 was used as the only indicator, which may have been lost or not expressed in the malignant specimens.",
            "We suggest that a well recognised standard for HPV detection in tumours should be issued for further studies.",
            "In this study, we employed both ISH and IHC to detect HPV-16 E6 expression.",
            "Among the 26 HPV-16-positive cancer samples detected by ISH, 18 were confirmed positive by IHC.",
            "More importantly, none of ISH-negative samples were detected positive by IHC.",
            "These results indicate that IHC is an accurate method with less sensitivity.",
            "The prevalence of HPV-16 infection in ovarian cancers is much higher than in nonmalignant ovarian tissues, suggesting that HVP-16 infection may play a role in the development of ovarian cancer.",
            "However, large case\u2013control studies need to be conducted before reaching a conclusion.",

            "Lifetime occupational histories (industry and job title) were coded by using standard international classifications and were translated into occupations known (list A) or suspected (list B) to be associated with lung cancer.",
            "Smoking-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with logistic regression.",
            "For men, an increased risk was found for list A (177 exposed cases and 100 controls; odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.74, 95% confidence interval: 1.27, 2.38) and most occupations therein.",

            "Among those in other occupations, risk excesses were found for metal workers, barbers and hairdressers, and other motor vehicle drivers.",
            "These results indicate that past exposure to occupational carcinogens remains an important determinant of lung cancer occurrence.",
            "Lung cancer is the most frequent neoplasm worldwide, with more than 1.4 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths in 2004.",
            "Rates for men have peaked in many areas of the world, but adenocarcinomas in both genders and all lung cancer types among women are still increasing.",
            "Although tobacco smoking is by large the most important cause, occupational factors play a remarkable role.",
            "In the year 2000, it was estimated that 10% of lung cancer deaths among men (88,000 deaths) and 5% among women (14,300 deaths) worldwide were attributable to exposure to 8 occupational lung carcinogens (arsenic, asbestos, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, diesel fumes, nickel, and silica).",
            "In Europe, assuming attributable fractions of 7%\u201315% (men) and 2%\u20139% (women), the estimated numbers of deaths were more than 29,300 and 3,200, respectively.",
            "In the United States, using 1997 mortality data and attributable fractions of 6.1%\u201317.3% (men) and 2% (women), about 6,800\u201317,000 lung cancers (both genders) were estimated to be caused by exposure to chemicals in the workplace.",
            "Prevalence of occupational exposure to carcinogens is still high: in 1990\u20131993, of almost 140 million workers in 15 states of the European Union, 32 million were estimated to be exposed to carcinogenic agents and about 7 million to the 8 above-mentioned carcinogens.",
            "The corresponding estimates for Italy were more than 4 million and 1 million, respectively; 10 years later (2000\u20132003), only modest decreases were found.",
            "Different approaches are used to evaluate occupational exposure to carcinogens: one makes use of lists of occupations known (list A) or suspected (list B) to be associated with lung cancer based on evaluations of carcinogenic risks by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).",

            "Briefly, the study included 2,100 incident lung cancer cases and 2,120 population controls enrolled in April 2002\u2013June 2005 in 216 municipalities including 5 cities (Milan, Monza, Brescia, Pavia, and Varese) in Lombardy, northern Italy.",
            "Subjects were 35\u201379 years of age at diagnosis (cases) or at sampling/enrollment (controls).",
            "Response rates (participants/eligible subjects) were 86.6% for cases and 72.4% for controls.",
            "Cases were admitted to 13 hospitals that examine more than 80% of lung cancer cases from the area and had any stage of primary cancer of the trachea, bronchus, and lung as well as morphology that were verified with tissue pathology (67.0%), cytology (28.0%), or review of clinical records (5.0%).",
            "Controls were randomly sampled from population databases, frequency matched to case by residence (5 areas), gender, and age (5-year categories), and were contacted through family physicians.",
            "The study was approved by institutional review boards, and participants signed an informed consent.",
            "Data collection",
            "Extensive clinical data were collected for lung cancer cases, including morphology coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition and categorized into major histologic subtypes based on World Health Organization/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer classification.",
            "All subjects underwent a computer-assisted personal interview and blood sampling (or buccal rinse collection for a small percentage of study subjects), and they completed a self-administered questionnaire (both questionnaires are available in Italian and English on the EAGLE website); lung tissue samples from cases were collected when available.",
            "The interview included lifetime history (years of start/stop, industry, job title) of jobs held for at least 6 months.",
            "Industries and job titles were coded blindly with respect to case or control status by 2 of the authors (S. D. M., D. C.), both occupational physicians with training and experience in epidemiology and industrial hygiene, following the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities and the International Standard Classification of Occupations.",
            "Codes were then translated into occupations known (list A) or suspected (list B) to entail a carcinogenic risk to the lung.",
            "The list B occupation filling station attendant, for which there are no specific codes, was identified through text search.",
            "Subjects with job titles from both lists were assigned to list A and to list B only if they had never worked in list A occupations; the reference group included subjects never employed in occupations on either list.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "We calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using unconditional logistic regression, separately by gender; when evaluating risk for the main histologic subtypes (adenocarcinoma, squamous, and small cell carcinoma), we used polytomous (multinomial) logistic regression.",
            "To adjust for smoking, we evaluated different models and finally chose the one with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion.",
            "The final model included the matching covariates area (5 categories) and age (5-year categories); cigarette smoking (ever/never); pack-years (continuous, mean centered: linear, quadratic, and cubic terms); time since quitting (0 for never/current smokers; 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, \u226530 years); smoking (ever/never) of pipe, cigars, cigarillos; and number of jobs held (1, 2, 3, 4, \u22655).",
            "We performed an analysis by length of employment in list A occupations, calculated by summing working periods spent in list A jobs.",
            "The population attributable fraction (PAF) for list A occupations was estimated by using the formula PEC \u00d7 (OR \u2212 1)/OR, where OR is the adjusted odds ratio and PEC the proportion of cases exposed to at least one of the occupations.",
            "To calculate the annual number of lung cancer cases attributable to list A occupations in Lombardy, we used the 2005 cancer incidence data.",
            "We repeated selected analyses by including educational level as a surrogate of socioeconomic status (4 categories\u2014none, elementary, middle, high school/higher degree combined\u2014because no subject with a university degree had worked in list A occupations).",
            "Unless specified, the odds ratios given in this paper were not adjusted for education.",
            "For subjects never employed in list A or list B occupations, we performed systematic exploratory analyses on single International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities codes (1\u20134 digits) and International Standard Classification of Occupations codes (1\u20133 and 5 digits).",
            "Results for industries/occupations for which at least 5 cases and 5 controls among men or women were exposed, and the odds ratio (education adjusted or not) was either doubled/halved or had a P value of \u22640.05, are given in Web Tables 1 and 2 (both are referred to as \u201cWeb table\u201d in the text and are posted on the Journal\u2019s website (http://aje.oupjournals.org/)).",

            "Two-thirds of subjects were from the Milan area.",
            "Controls had a higher educational level (men) and had held more jobs.",
            "Among cases, one-fourth of women were never smokers versus only 2% of men.",
            "Almost half of the men (cases or controls) were former smokers compared with less than 30% of the women.",
            "In both genders, about 50% of cases and less than 30% of controls were current smokers.",
            "Men had smoked greater numbers of cigarettes.",
            "About 15%\u201317% of cases and 9%\u201310% of controls had primary cancer(s), previously or newly diagnosed, other than lung cancer.",
            "The majority of lung cancers were adenocarcinomas (>50% in women).",
            "Occupations included in lists A and B",
            "Among men, 177 cases (11.5%) and 100 controls (6.2%) had ever worked in list A occupations, with an overall odds ratio of 1.74 (Table 2); the corresponding PAF was 4.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0, 7.8).",
            "After further adjustment for dietary habits (consumption of red and processed meat, fruit and vegetables, and alcohol) and passive smoking (at home or the workplace), the odds ratio was practically unchanged (OR\u2009=\u20091.80).",
            "Most of the occupations in list A showed moderate to strong positive associations, notably (in terms of the OR and number of exposed subjects) the ceramic and refractory brick sector and occupations within the nonferrous basic industry.",
            "The risk excess for painters was modest (construction) or moderate (automobile and others).",
            "After adjustment for education, the general pattern of increased risks for list A was confirmed, although odds ratios were lower (Table 2, last 2 columns); on the basis of the overall excess of 53%, we estimated a PAF of 4.0% (95% CI: 0.8, 7.1).",
            "When evaluating the risk excess for list A occupations by morphology (results not shown in tables), we found a stronger association for small-cell (OR\u2009=\u20092.04) and squamous (OR\u2009=\u20091.97) carcinomas compared with adenocarcinoma (OR\u2009=\u20091.38); however, the difference was not statistically significant (P\u2009=\u20090.18).",
            "Analysis by length of employment in list A occupations yielded the following results (not shown in tables): <10 years: OR = 1.64 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.56); 10\u201319 years: OR = 3.89 (95% CI: 1.80, 8.40); 20\u201329 years: OR = 1.30 (95% CI: 0.57, 3.00); \u226530 years: OR\u2009=\u20091.79 (95% CI: 0.94, 3.40) (P for trend\u2009=\u20090.001).",
            "In total, 345 cases (22.4%) and 346 controls (21.4%) among men had been working in occupations in list B, with no overall increased risk (Table 3).",
            "We found a marked elevated risk for filling station attendants.",
            "The excess for bus or truck drivers was modest but was based on a large number of subjects; moderate to strong associations (based on a few subjects) were observed for several other occupations, including leather tanners and processors, glass workers, and welders.",
            "The odds ratios were reduced after adjustment for education (Table 3, last 2 columns).",
            "Among women, only 3 cases (1 in ceramic and pottery, 2 in nonferrous industries) and 2 controls (painters) had ever been employed in list A occupations, with an odds ratio of 4.05 and a PAF of 0.6% (95% CI: \u22122.7, 3.7).",
            "For list B occupations, the odds ratio was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.94) based on 24 cases and 26 controls exposed; there were few exposed women in specific occupations, with the exception of laundry and dry cleaners (12 cases and 11 controls exposed), for which we calculated an odds ratio of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.46, 3.41).",
            "Our odds ratio estimate for list A occupations was very close to the average of 1.7 emerging from Italian studies.",
            "However, we found a lower PAF because of the lower proportion of exposed cases (Table 4).",
            "Other industries and occupations not included in lists A and B",
            "For both genders, we found elevated risks for several industry branches within the categories manufacture of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment; other manufacturing industries; and barber and beauty shops (Web Table 1).",
            "From the analysis of occupations (Web Table 2), we found elevated risks for both genders for professional and technical workers not elsewhere classified, hairdressers and related workers, and several occupations within major group 7/8/9 (production and related workers, transport equipment operators and laborers).",
            "For men, odds ratios were elevated for motor vehicle drivers.",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "In this large, population-based case-control study performed in 2002\u20132005 in Lombardy, northern Italy\u2014the most populated (about 9,750,000 inhabitants), economically relevant, and industrialized region in Italy\u2014we found a relative risk excess of 74% for men ever employed in occupations known (list A) to be associated with lung cancer, with the largest contributions from the ceramic and refractory brick and the nonferrous basic industries.",
            "The PAF was 4.9%.",
            "For women, the relative risk excess was greater (OR\u2009=\u20094.05), although imprecise because of the very low numbers of women exposed.",
            "Of the occupations suspected (list B) to be associated with lung cancer, we found a marked excess for filling station attendants (men) and suggestive increases for bus and truck drivers (men) and launderers and dry cleaners (women).",
            "This study confirmed the important role of past occupational exposures as a determinant of lung cancer risk at the beginning of the new century.",
            "Applying the PAF of 4.9% to the 4,515 incident male cases of lung cancer that occurred in 2005 in Lombardy, we estimated that 221 cases per year (95% CI: 90, 352), or 181 (95% CI: 36, 321) for the education-adjusted PAF, were attributable to past employment in list A occupations.",
            "These figures contrast with the low number of occupational lung cancers officially reported to and compensated by the National Insurance Institute for Work Injuries (Istituto Nazionale per l'Assicurazione contro gli Infortuni sul Lavoro, INAIL); for instance, in 1999\u20132004, only 399 work-related lung cancer cases (on average, 66.5/year) were reported in Lombardy, and about half of them were compensated.",
            "The low PAF for list A occupations among women was expected, given that exposure to most occupational lung carcinogens occurred in workplaces in which women constituted a minority.",
            "The major strengths of the present study are the enrollment of incident cases and randomly sampled population controls; the large sample size; the unusually high participation rates, especially considering that biologic samples were requested; and the face-to-face collection of detailed information with a structured questionnaire by trained interviewers.",
            "Still, in interpreting the results, we considered several possible sources of bias.",
            "Reliability of self-reported job history is usually considered good and not a source of important recall bias.",
            "Blind coding of occupations eliminated the possibility of differential bias, although a certain degree of nondifferential misclassification is practically unavoidable, leading to an average bias toward the null.",
            "We exploited the detailed interview data to adjust for different smoking-related characteristics.",
            "Adjustment for education (an indicator of socioeconomic status) is usually performed to control for unmeasured nonoccupational (e.g., lifestyle) confounders or to address differential selection (nonresponse) between cases and controls, although some authors argue that doing so would lead to underestimated occupational risks.",
            "Our results were not altered (OR\u2009=\u20091.80) by adjustment for diet, alcohol consumption, and passive smoking.",
            "Moreover, to evaluate potential differential participation, we compared educational level among cases and controls who refused to participate in the study but consented to respond to a few selected questions: contrary to observations by others, we found no association (P\u2009=\u20090.68).",
            "For these reasons, the odds ratios not adjusted for education are probably a better estimate of the effect of occupation in our study, but we presented both types of estimates here.",
            "Our relative risk excess for list A occupations among men is consistent with those found in different countries since the 1970s.",
            "When we excluded a study conducted in a mining area with an unusually large excess, the average odds ratio was 1.4 (range, 0.4\u20131.9).",
            "The odds ratio for list A occupations (men) also closely corresponds with the findings from Italian studies (Table 4).",
            "However, we found a lower PAF, for several reasons.",
            "First, those studies were conducted in areas with a high concentration of workers exposed to asbestos in shipbuilding and railroad equipment manufacturing or to multiple carcinogens in foundries and the chemical and metal industries.",
            "Second, we found lower risks for painters, the occupation with the highest number of exposed cases (Table 2); as a result, the overall excess was lower (OR\u2009=\u20092.23 for list A occupations other than painters).",
            "Third, occupational exposure to carcinogens has been decreasing over time because of improved workplace conditions.",
            "The lack of an overall association for list B occupations is in agreement with a recent case-control study conducted in northern Italy.",
            "The findings for individual occupations in list B are only suggestive because the excess risk was moderate or the number of exposed subjects was small.",
            "The only clear excess was for filling station attendants (men), for which the evidence in the literature is conflicting.",
            "The 23% increased risk for bus and truck drivers deserves mention because it was based on a substantial number of exposed workers and because we found an excess for other motor vehicle drivers not included among list B occupations.",
            "For women, we found a moderate risk increase for launderers and dry cleaners, a finding reported in other studies.",
            "The results for single International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities and International Standard Classification of Occupations codes not included in list A or B should be regarded as suggestive because of poor sensitivity and specificity in defining exposures and multiple comparison issues.",
            "Some of the increased risks deserve mention because they are biologically plausible, were consistent across gender, or were already reported in the literature, in particular metal production and processing, barbers and hairdressers, and motor vehicle drivers (men).",
            "In conclusion, the findings of this study confirm the need for continuous monitoring and improved control of work-related exposures, both for prevention and workers\u2019 compensation purposes.",
            "Future occupational health studies should improve their ability to address interindividual variability in response to the lower exposures in work settings."

            "These results indicate that the cytotoxicity of MWCNTs requires not only cellular uptake but also lysosomal injury.",

            "The probability of occupational and public exposure to CNTs has significantly increased.",
            "Although the biocompatibility of carbon materials is known to be good, CNTs possess asbestos-like features (ie, a nanoscale size and an aspect ratio above 100).",
            "Thus, CNTs may pose extraordinary hazards to human health.",
            "Although many studies on the safety of CNTs have been conducted, a clear conclusion cannot be drawn.",
            "A wide range of results from in vitro studies have been reported; some studies reported that CNTs cause cytotoxicity and cytokine production, while other studies reported the absence of osteogenic acceleration effects.",
            "Such different results are probably caused by variations both in the specific characteristics of the CNTs tested (single versus multi; length and diameter; concentration; and impurities) and the type of cells used.",
            "Our group has previously reported that some types of cells internalize MWCNTs, while other types of cells do not.",
            "We found that the internalization of MWCNTs causes cytotoxicity, while the adhesion of MWCNTs only leads to altered protein expression levels without cell growth inhibition.",
            "These results led us to hypothesize that the cytotoxic properties of MWCNTs are correlated with the endocytic ability of cells.",
            "Therefore, systematic evaluation of cell responses to MWCNTs is essential for understanding the exact mechanism of MWCNT toxicity.",

            "We observed that VGCF-dispersed medium was not found to induce the morphological change in the tested four cell lines ( Figure 1(A) a, d, g, j and m; Figure 2a, d and g).",
            "BEAS-2B cells were only exposed to VGCF at 1 \u03bcg/mL concentration because VGCF at 10 \u03bcg/mL caused many cell deaths in BEAS-2B cells.",
            "The differentiated THP-1 cells phagocytosed VGCF, and the MESO-1 and BEAS-2B cells actively migrated and endocytosed VGCF without distinguishing single fibers or aggregates (Figure 1(A) c, f and l; Movies 1\u20133).",

            "No VGCF accumulation was observed around the nuclei, and the VGCF merely adhered to the cells or accumulated around the cells.",
            "Three types of cells also endocytosed SB, and this SB endocytosis was also inhibited by CytoD (Figure 1(B)b, e and h).",
            "TEM images showed that internalized VGCF and SB had a perinuclear localization without nuclear import ( Figure 2B, C, E, F, H and I).",
            "SB settled in the lysosomes and vacuoles, while VGCF broke through the lysosomes and vacuoles.",
            "On the other hand, IMR-32 and undifferentiated THP-1 cells seemed to internalize little VGCF (Figure 1(A) i and o).",
            "The VGCF that was not internalized by the IMR-32 and undifferentiated THP-1 cells agglutinated in the culture media during a 24-hour period, and this agglutinated VGCF adhered to the cells.",
            "SB, the negative control, also became agglutinated and was not internalized by IMR-32 or undifferentiated THP-1 cells (Figure 1(A)h and n).",

            "The viability of SB-exposed cells remained at more than 80% for all cell types, even if the cells were treated with an SB concentration equivalent to a cytotoxic concentration of VGCF.",
            "Results of the LDH assay were slightly different from those of the Alamar blue assay (Figure 3F\u2013J).",
            "All cell types, except IMR-32 cells, had approximately 50% plasma membrane permeability after exposure to VGCF at the dosage of maximum concentration as compared with DM exposure for each cell type.",
            "The IMR-32 cells leaked only a small amount of LDH even at the maximum concentration of VGCF.",
            "SB at the same concentration as the maximum VGCF concentration clearly resulted in less membrane permeability than VGCF for all cell types, but the SB-induced permeability increased with statistical significance in the MESO-1 cells and both types of THP-1 cells.",
            "Cytokine production",
            "The cytokine production of differentiated and undifferentiated THP-1 cells exposed to VGCF or SB was measured.",
            "In response to VGCF exposure, the levels of TNF and IL-1\u03b2 secreted into the culture medium by differentiated THP-1 cells were increased (Figure 4A\u2013C).",
            "In response to SB exposure, IL-1\u03b2 secretion was increased, but TNF secretion was decreased.",
            "LPS, which was used as the positive control, increased the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF in the same manner as VGCF; however, the amounts of cytokines secreted were different.",
            "The IL-1\u03b2 concentration induced by VGCF was higher than that induced by LPS, but the TNF concentration induced by LPS was markedly greater than that induced by VGCF.",
            "Furthermore, LPS also significantly induced the secretion of IL-6, but VGCF and SB did not (data not shown).",
            "The levels of IL-10 and IL-12 were less than the detection limit for all treated differentiated THP-1 cells.",
            "Interestingly, the IL-8 secretion by undifferentiated THP-1 cells was very low after exposure to DM but was increased after exposure to VGCF, SB and LPS (Figure 4D); while differentiated THP-1 cells secreted IL-8 at similar levels (ng/mL) after exposure to DM, VGCF or SB.",
            "Other cytokines were not secreted at significant levels by undifferentiated THP-1 cells.",
            "Cellular ROS production",
            "We investigated whether VGCF causes cellular ROS production by using carboxy-DCFDA as a reporter for intracellular oxidant production.",
            "ROS production was decreased significantly for all cells (except IMR-32 cells) after 1 hour of exposure to VGCF in comparison with DM (Figure 5).",
            "SB also decreased ROS production by MESO-1 and differentiated THP-1 cells.",
            "Discussion",
            "There have been some reports on the toxicity of CNTs using different cell types where biological responses, such as cell viability, morphology change and DNA content, were reported to be different according to the types of cells.",
            "Recently, we found that the differences in the sensitivity to MWCNTs were caused by the volume ratio between cell and MWCNTs.",
            "However, our previous study revealed that U937 human monoblastic leukemia cells do not show a significant cytotoxic response to purified MWCNTs.",
            "Therefore, in the present study, we examined four different cell lines in order to investigate the difference in biological responses to MWCNTs.",
            "The neuroblast was added in order to evaluate neurotoxicity because carbon particles able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier are known to affect the central nervous system and MWCNTs are known to influence a protein associated with neurons.",
            "We also examined the effect of MWCNTs on cells at different states of differentiation, and the relationship between cytotoxicity and the cellular uptake of MWCNTs.",
            "Our results indicate that MWCNTs uptake is involved in cytotoxicity.",
            "We used two colorimetric assays to evaluate the cytotoxicity.",
            "Casey et al reported that CNTs could absorb the dye, interfering in cytotoxicity measurements.",
            "We also confirmed that the cell viability was observed to be about 30% at 100 \u03bcg/mL of MWCNTs using the alamar blue assay.",
            "However, there was no large difference in LDH assay and alamar blue assay at levels under 50 \u03bcg/mL of MWCNTs.",
            "The internalization of MWCNTs to MESO-1, BEAS-2B and differentiated THP-1 cells was marked by less than 50% viability and more than 50% plasma membrane permeability after exposure to less than 50 \u03bcg/mL of MWCNTs.",
            "At that time, these cells internalized large amounts of MWCNTs and peeled off from the dish.",
            "We found that the amount of MWCNTs in the cytoplasm was closely related to the decrease in cell viability.",
            "However, the cells that endocytosed MWCNTs could divide when the amount of MWCNTs in the cell was small.",
            "These cells also internalized SB but did not show any cytotoxicity.",
            "It is reported that the internalized carbon nanomaterials aggregate in the lysosomes and vacuoles.",
            "SB also aggregates in the lysosomes.",
            "However, MWCNTs damaged the lysosomes, but SB did not.",
            "Disruption of the lysosome may influence these cytotoxic difference between VGCF and SB and the volume pressure of VGCF which were not enclosed in the lysosome, might cause cell death.",
            "According to a review by Raffa et al, the internalization of mainly single-walled CNTs can occur by phagocytosis, endocytosis or diffusion.",
            "There are three crucial parameters influencing the CNTs interaction with cells: the degree of dispersion, the formation of supramolecular complexes and the nanotube length.",
            "Time-lapse microscopy in the present study showed that the degree of MWCNT dispersion did not seem to influence the internalization of MWCNTs by macrophage- like differentiated THP-1 cells by phagocytosis or by mesothelioma origin MESO-1 cells or pulmonary epithelium origin BEAS-2B cells by endocytosis.",
            "We used CytoD, an actin barbed-end capping molecule, to inhibit phagocytosis and endocytosis.",
            "CytoD inhibited the internalization of not only MWCNTs but also SB, which has a particle size of less than 1 \u03bcm.",
            "Thus, the results of the present study do not support the theory of MWCNT internalization by diffusion.",
            "Because the definition of endocytosis generally includes phagocytosis and we could not differentiate between endocytosis and phagocytosis, we assume that the cells internalized MWCNTs via endocytosis in the present study.",
            "The IMR-32 cells and undifferentiated THP-1 cells maintained more than 50% cell viability and they were not injured at 100 \u03bcg/mL of MWCNTs.",
            "At this concentration, we observed many MWCNT agglomerates on the bottom of the wells, and the IMR-32 and undifferentiated THP-1 cells were adhered to the aggregated MWCNTs rather than to single MWCNT molecules or thin bundled MWCNTs.",
            "In particular, the undifferentiated THP-1 cells adhere to VGCF agglomerates, although they are naturally non-adhesive cells, and secreted IL\u20138.",
            "Rosales and Juliano reported that integrin-mediated adhesion induces a set of immediate early genes that are characteristic of monocytic differentiation containing IL-8.",
            "In fact, THP-1 cells differentiated by PMA secreted IL-8 in our study.",
            "Also, considering the fact that the doubling time of IMR-32 cells and undifferentiated THP-1 cells is about 40 hours and 18 hours, respectively, the biological responses of these cells exposed to MWCNTs might not be cytotoxicity, but active responses including cell differentiation and enhancement of the plasma membrane permeability.",
            "Recently, we reported that MWCNTs exhibited differential inducibility on C2C12 cells.",
            "On the other hand, the reasons why these cells adhered in the aggregated SB were an observed slight decrease in cell permeability and increased IL-8 secretion.",
            "It may be that the agglomeration of SB was entirely small and had little effect.",
            "However, SB slightly increased the permeability of differentiated THP-1 cells.",
            "This biological response may be the same mechanism as in the case of the increased plasma membrane permeability of undifferentiated THP-1 cells exposed to MWCNTs.",
            "Walker et al reported that carbon black increased the release of LDH by human aortic endothelial cells without a loss of cell viability.",
            "It appears that the assessment of cytotoxicity by measurement of cell permeability is not suitable when using carbon materials.",
            "We examined whether intracellular ROS production is involved in biological responses (including cytotoxicity) to MWCNTs.",
            "Some studies have reported that the production of ROS is critical in the hazardous effects of CNTs, while other studies have not supported this relationship.",
            "Our results were different for each type of cell, but the production of intracellular ROS did not increase; instead, a scavenger effect for intracellular ROS was observed.",
            "Iron is used during the catalytic production of CNTs.",
            "This iron remains in CNTs as a residue, and the Fenton reaction is elicited, which is said to cause oxidative stress.",
            "However, because the iron content in the VGCF that we used in this study was very low, only a small amount of ROS was produced, and the scavenger effect of the CNTs themselves may have appeared.",
            "We also assayed the LPS-induced cytokine production by THP-1 cells.",
            "LPS induces nuclear factor-\u03baB, which is induced by ROS, and it represents a cytokine secretion pattern unlike the VGCF-induced effects on differentiated THP-1 cells.",
            "Hence, the MWCNTs-induced secretion of cytokines is not caused by ROS.",
            "We investigated the cytotoxic effects of MWCNTs by examining the differences in the biological responses of different cell lines to MWCNTs.",
            "We found that the biological responses to MWCNTs were different in different cell lines, and even the same cell line exhibited different responses according to its differentiation state.",
            "Our results indicate that other biological responses (ie, enhancement of cell membrane permeability and increased cytokine production) may be due to direct contact with MWCNTs, and that endocytosis of MWCNTs is the main reason (or onset mechanism) for MWCNTs cytotoxicity.",
            "Since the biological responses apart from the cytotoxicity of MWCNTs are active responses, MWCNTs may possibly be used as biomaterials if used appropriately and with caution.",
            "In addition, we confirmed that SB as a negative control in the present study did not cause cytotoxicity.",
            "These observations suggest that the key to the safe use of CNTs is avoiding endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal and vacuolar injury."

            "In addition, many of the known or suggested factors that are associated with lower risk for endometrial cancer were less prevalent among case patients than among control subjects, including ever use of combined oral contraceptives (41% versus 56%; P <.001), past or current history of cigarette smoking (49% versus 58%; P <.001), osteoporosis (15% versus 19%; P = .038), tubal ligation (24% versus 33%; P <.001), younger age at fi rst pregnancy (11% versus 17% were <20 years; P = .002), older age at last pregnancy (14% versus 21% were \u2265 35 years; P <.001), and ever breastfeeding (35% versus 43%; P <.001).",
            "These results demonstrate that our data are consistent with previous reports regarding endometrial cancer risk factors.",

            "Genotyping success rates varied across the variants studied, with failure rates ranging from 5.6% to 12.5% and most having failure rates of less than 10%.",
            "Deviations from Hardy -Weinberg proportions were observed in some groups defi ned by case status and race ( Table 1 ), but these deviations were not consistent across all groups for a particular genotype, suggesting that genotyping error was not the cause of these deviations.",
            "The only genotype for which Hardy -Weinberg deviations were observed was CYP3A4*1B, which deviated from Hardy -Weinberg proportions in case patients and control subjects of both races.",
            "This result is consistent with deviations from Hardy -Weinberg equilibrium that have been reported in many studies of this variant and re-fl ects the fact that this variant deviates from Hardy -Weinberg equilibrium in most populations ( 42 ) .",
            "As shown in Table 3 , no association was observed between endometrial cancer risk and genotype for COMT, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP3A4, PGR, SULT1A1*2, or UGT1A1 genes.",

            "We observed a statistically signifi cant interaction between use of estrogen replacement therapy and SULT1A1*2 genotype ( Table 4 ), indicating that the effect of estrogen replacement therapy use differed according to the individual's SULT1A1*2 variant genotype status.",
            "Among subjects with the reference genotype (SULT1A1*1), risk of endometrial cancer was not associated with use of estrogen replacement therapy of less than 3 years or 3 years or more.",
            "However, among subjects with the variant genotype (SULT1A1*2), use of estrogen replacement therapy for less than 3 years was associated with a decreased risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.88) and use for 3 years or more was associated with a statistically signifi cantly increased risk (OR = 3.85, 95% CI = 1.48 to 10.00).",
            "As shown in Table 4 , the global (2 df) test assessing the interaction between genotype and use of hormone replacement therapy was statistically signifi cant ( P = .011), indicating that at least one of the two odds ratios for estrogen replacement therapy use (either short term or long term) differed between those with and without the SULT1A1*2 variant.",

            "First, for subjects with short-term exposure, the effect of genotype was not associated with endometrial cancer ( \u03c7 2 1 = 2.59 and P = .207), when the adjusted odds ratio estimates of 1.47 and 0.40 in Table 4 were compared.",
            "Second, for subjects with long-term exposure, the effect of genotype was statistically signifi cantly associated with endometrial cancer ( \u03c7 2 1 = 7.41 and P = .007), when the adjusted odds ratio estimates of 1.87 and 3.85 in Table 4 are compared.",
            "Third, for subjects with the reference genotype, the effect of length of estrogen replacement therapy use was not statistically significantly associated with endometrial cancer risk ( \u03c7 2 1 = 0.13 and P = .720), when the adjusted odds ratio estimates of 1.47 and 1.87 in Table 4 were compared.",
            "Finally, for subjects with the variant genotype, the effect of length of estrogen replacement therapy use was statistically signifi cantly associated with risk ( \u03c7 2 1 = 15.98 and P <.001), when the adjusted odds ratio estimates of 0.40 and 3.85 in Table 4 were compared.",
            "To evaluate the possibility that the statistically signifi cant associations reported in Tables 4 and5 represent false-positive fi ndings, we calculated the false-positive report probability ( 41 ) for relevant associations in Tables 4 and5 by assuming prior probabilities of an association among genotype, hormone use, and endometrial cancer of .05, .1, and .2.",
            "For all main effect odds ratios that we reported as statistically signifi cantly different from an odds ratio of 1.0 in Tables 4 and5 , the false-positive report probability was less than .3 (and generally less than .2) unless the prior probability was low (i.e., \u2264 .05).",
            "For the effects of estrogen replacement therapy use among those with the variant SULT1A1 gene, a false-positive report probability of .3 or less was observed when the prior probability of an association was assumed to be .05 or more.",
            "That is, these estimated odds ratios can be considered likely to be true-positive associations only when the prior probability for this association is assumed to be .05 or more.",
            "Given the strong biologic plausibility that SULT1A1 could be involved in mediating the biologic effect of estrogen replacement therapy use, it is reasonable to make such an assumption.",
            "D ISCUSSION",
            "We have reported that variants in CYP1A1, SULT1E1, and possibly SULT1A1 genes are associated with endometrial cancer risk.",
            "We have also reported that the statistical interaction of SULT1A1 genotypes with the use of estrogen replacement therapy appears to infl uence endometrial cancer risk.",
            "Inferences from most of the literature, including the present study, indicate that use of estrogen replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer and that use of combined hormone replacement therapy is inversely associated with the risk of endometrial cancer ( 8 , 11 -17 , 19 -22 ) .",
            "Our results further indicate that these effects may differ according to whether women carry the functional SULT1A1*2 variant.",
            "Genes involved in the sulfation of estrogens have not been previously studied in the context of endometrial cancer etiology.",
            "We identifi ed an association between the -64G>A variant in SULT1E1 and endometrial cancer risk and showed that the association of estrogen replacement therapy and endometrial cancer risk was different depending on SULT1A1*2 genotype.",
            "Sulfation by SULT1A1 and SULT1E1 enzymes may protect endometrial cells from the mitogenic and DNA-damaging activities of estradiol and its catecholestrogen metabolites ( 43 ) . Sulfation of 2-hydroxycatecholestrogen can also compete with its methylation ( Fig. 1 ).",
            "This methylated product is antimitogenic and anti proliferative ( 44 , 45 ) . SULT1E1 has high affi nity for estrone, estradiol, and catecholestrogens ( 46 ) .",
            "However, the function of the SULT1E1 -64G> A variant is not yet known, so we cannot infer whether this association is biologically meaningful, occurred by chance, or refl ects linkage disequilibrium with another genetic variant at or near SULT1E1.",
            "We have also reported that the association between estrogen replacement therapy and endometrial cancer may be different according to SULT1A1*2 genotype.",
            "The biologic function of the SULT1A1*2 allele has been well characterized; the protein coded by the SULT1A1*2 genotype is associated with lower enzyme thermostability, lower enzyme activity ( 47 ) , and lower estrogen sulfation ability than the nonvariant form ( 39 , 58 ) .",
            "The SULT1A1 enzyme acts on ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, and catecholestrogens ( Fig. 1 ).",
            "Thus, the decreased ability to sulfate exogenous estradiol that is associated with the use of estrogen replacement therapy may explain the increased risk of endometrial cancer in some women and be a possible mechanism for the development of endometrial cancer.",
            "These data have potential clinical implications for the use of hormone replacement therapy.",
            "Because estrogen replacement therapy is strongly associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, until now it has been thought that unopposed estrogen replacement therapy should not normally be recommended for women with an intact uterus.",
            "Our results suggest that women who do not carry a SULT1A1*2 allele, and therefore have increased estrogen sulfation capacity, may not be at elevated risk of endometrial cancer when using long-term unopposed estrogen replacement therapy.",
            "Therefore, our results provide initial evidence that the risk of endometrial cancer associated with estrogen replacement therapy or combined hormone replacement therapy may in part depend on estrogen sulfation genotypes of the women who use these hormones.",
            "We also evaluated other genes involved in the metabolic pathways of steroid hormones.",
            "No association was observed between endometrial cancer risk and COMT, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP3A4, PGR, SULT1A1*3, or UGT1A1 genotype.",
            "Therefore, our results are consistent with reported lack of associations with CYP1A2 ( 32 ) , COMT ( 30 , 32 ) , and CYP1B1 ( 30 -32 ) , but they are inconsistent with previous reports of associations with CYP1B1 in a Japanese population ( 33 ) and with UGT1A1 ( 36 ) and PGR ( 35 ) .",
            "We also have reported an increased endometrial cancer risk associated with the CYP1A1*2C allele (i.e., Ile462Val), contrary to the fi ndings of Doherty et al. ( 32 ) , who reported that this polymorphism is inversely associated with endometrial cancer.",
            "Because of these discrepancies, we cannot confi rm the association between these genes and endometrial cancer risk.",
            "Despite the strength and biologic plausibility of most of the associations observed in this study, our study has some limitations.",
            "First, we specifi ed a large number of a priori hypothesis tests, and it is thus possible that we have detected false-positive associations.",
            "We have computed the false-positive report probability of Wacholder et al. ( 41 ) to aid in interpreting our fi ndings.",
            "In situations in which we observed statistically signifi cant associations ( Table 2 ), the false-positive report probability results generally supported these inferences.",
            "Another concern is that our study sample contained both African Americans and whites, leading to the potential for confounding by ethnicity (population stratifi cation).",
            "However, we matched our case patients and control subjects by race, thus removing the majority of the variability that could lead to this confounding ( 48 ) .",
            "We have also systematically evaluated the potential for bias in the estimates from logistic regression in case -control studies that involve admixed populations ( 49 ) .",
            "In these evaluations, we did not identify substantial biases in the odds ratios, given the range of genotype frequencies and baseline disease risks that we found.",
            "In addition, we evaluated whether there were race-specifi c differences in the direction or magnitude of effects of genotype and hormone replacement therapy use by testing for the presence of interactions by race.",
            "No such interactions were observed, suggesting that the estimates of genotype and/or hormone replacement therapy effect were not statistically signifi cantly different by race.",
            "Thus, the odds ratios presented in Table 2 are unlikely to be even moderately biased by population stratifi cation.",
            "Although we have limited our analyses to evaluate fi rst-order interactions between genotypes and hormone replacement therapy use, the sample sizes for the joint effects of these factors sometimes were very 0.40 (0.12 to 1.32) \u2020",

            "The low response rates could have affected our results, particularly if the reasons for nonresponse were related to important risk factors or confounders involved in endometrial cancer etiology and/or if the nonresponse was differential with respect to case -control status.",

            "The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) became operational in 1952; it is located in the western part of Kentucky.",
            "We conducted a mortality study for adverse health effects that workers may have suffered while working at the plant, including exposures to chemicals.",
            "Materials and Methods",
            "We studied a cohort of 6820 workers at the PGDP for the period 1953 to 2003; there were a total of 1672 deaths to cohort members.",
            "Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a specific concern for this workforce; exposure to TCE occurred primarily in departments that clean the process equipment.",
            "The Life Table Analysis System (LTAS) program developed by NIOSH was used to calculate the standardized mortality ratios for the worker cohort and standardized rate ratio relative to exposure to TCE (the U.S. population is the referent for age-adjustment).",

            "A further review of three major cancers of interest to Kentucky produced significantly low SMR for trachea, bronchus, lung cancer (0.75, 95% CI: 0.72\u20130.79) and high SMR for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (1.49, 95% CI: 1.02\u20132.10).",
            "Results",
            "No significant SMR was observed for leukemia and no significant SRRs were observed for any disease.",
            "Both the leukemia and lung cancer results were examined and determined to reflect regional mortality patterns.",

            "INTRODUCTION",
            "The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) is a uranium enrichment plant that became operational in September, 1952.",
            "The PGDP is located approximately 10 miles west of the city of Paducah in the western part of Kentucky.",
            "The plant still functions to enrich uranium through a series of cascades designed to remove impurities from the product of choice.",
            "The process of gaseous diffusion allows for Uranium Fluoride (UF6) to diffuse through a cascade in which Uranium235 is removed from the combined Uranium235 and Uranium238 gases.",
            "This product is then used in commercial reactors or transferred to other plants for further refinement.",
            "Concerns have been raised about the adverse health effects that workers may have suffered while or after performing specific tasks at the plant.",
            "Community concerns about the health outcomes among the PGDP workers led to the development of the PGDP study.",
            "Based on recommendations from the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH), the PGDP study was designed to be completed in three phases.",
            "The first stage involved a feasibility study completed in January 2003.",
            "The second stage was a pilot study completed in January of 2004.",
            "The third stage was an evaluation of worker mortality related to workplace exposures.",
            "This paper provides results from the third stage, with special emphasis on worker exposure to trichloroethylene.",
            "BACKGROUND",
            "Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a nonflammable, colorless liquid at room temperature with a sweet odor and a sweet, burning taste.",
            "TCE is taken up by direct contact through the skin, ingestion, and by inhalation.",
            "When TCE enters the human body, it may break down into dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, chloral hydrate, or 2-chloroacetaldehyde; all of which are toxic to animals and humans.",
            "It undergoes metabolic activation primarily in the liver, but also in the kidneys and lungs.",
            "A major concern of occupational exposure to TCE is that it may cause cancer.",
            "Studies have classified TCE as a probable human carcinogen.",
            "Long-term occupational exposure to TCE may result in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, multiple myeloma, kidney cancer, and cancer of the liver and biliary tract.",
            "Based on conversations with current and former workers, Moser established that workers at the PGDP were exposed to TCE primarily in departments that clean the process equipment as TCE was used to degrease fabricated metal parts.",
            "The job titles with the highest TCE exposures were: laboratory, maintenance/electrician, maintenance/lubrication, waste operations, and chemical operator.",
            "Past research of human exposures reveals that very few studies have isolated TCE exposure from other chemical exposures.",
            "To determine if there was any relationship between exposures experienced while working at the PGDP and premature mortality, standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and standardized rate ratios (SRR) were calculated.",
            "A SMR is defined as the ratio of the observed deaths compared to (divided by) the deaths that would have been expected in the cohort had they experienced the same death rates as the reference population; person-years at risk are used to weight the expected rates.",
            "A SRR is the ratio of two standardized rates within the same cohort \u2014 the exposed portion of the cohort's age standardized rate compared to (divided by) the unexposed portion of the cohort's age standardized rate using the person-years at risk to weight the rates.",
            "METHODS",
            "A Job Exposure Matrix was developed by Moser based on discussions with current and past employees at the plant.",
            "Each job title was ranked by classifying the likelihood of short-term exposure to TCE from zero, being no possibility of exposure, through 5, being most probable of exposure.",
            "These exposure levels are qualitative only, and as such, have no mathematical relationship \u2014 an exposure of 4 is not twice the exposure of 2.",
            "The Life Table Analysis System (LTAS) program developed by NIOSH was used to calculate the SMR for the worker cohort and SRR relative to exposure to TCE.",
            "LTAS requires three distinct files to conduct the analyses \u2014 person, work history, and outcome files.",
            "The person file consisted of a numerical identifier for each worker, sex, race, date of birth, hire date, and date last observed which could be date of death, date last observed or end of study date.",
            "The work history file contained the identifier for each worker, a separate line for each job title held by the worker, the start and end date for the job, and the TCE exposure ranking of each job.",
            "The outcome file provided the identifier and date of death and cause of death using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code in use at the time of death.",
            "A nosologist provided the ICD code in use at the time of death for those death certificates for which an ICD code was not provided.",
            "These files provided an overall SMR for the workers and provided SMRs for specific disease states with additional separation of the workers by race and gender.",
            "LTAS used the current ICD code at time of death.",
            "In order to make SMR comparisons of workers exposed to different TCE exposure levels, it was necessary to determine which exposure levels were most alike or different.",
            "The project industrial hygienist stated that TCE exposure levels zero and 1 were similar and TCE exposures 4 and 5 were similar.",
            "She was uncertain as to which group TCE exposure levels 2 and 3 should be combined.",
            "The following worker TCE exposure level groups were developed: zero exposure, zero or 1 exposure, 2 or 3 exposure, 4 or 5 exposure, and a group of workers with an exposure of zero to 3 as a comparison group to workers with an exposure of 4 or 5 (Table 1).",
            "In order to use LTAS to calculate TCE SMRs and SRRs, new files were created.",
            "For the SMR calculation person, work history and outcome files were created for each TCE exposure group.",
            "The first step was to reduce the history file, for each exposure group, such that each worker only had one work history line versus the multiple lines for each respective job title in the original history file.",
            "The begin date was based on the date first exposed to TCE.",
            "For all exposure groups the end date was the date of death or end of study.",
            "The person file was changed such that the date last observed was the date of death or end of study.",
            "No changes were made to the outcome file.",
            "Changes to the work history file were made such that each worker was assigned the number zero to 3 based on the category number as defined above.",
            "For exposure categories zero, 1, and 2 the begin date would be the date of hire.",
            "For category 3 the begin date was the date at which the worker first experienced a TCE exposure of 4 or 5.",
            "Analyses were done by exposure level or group of exposure levels.",
            "For calculating the SRR only one set of person, work history, and outcome files were required.",
            "In order to calculate the SRR, the TCE exposure groups used to calculate the TCE exposure SMR had to be combined into four TCE categories such that each worker would only be in one category (Table 2).",
            "Owing to a finding related to lung cancer and leukemia risk, an adjustment for regional effects was made.",
            "Respective, age-adjusted, race- and gender-specific lung cancer mortality rates were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics.",
            "Smoking prevalence rates were based upon self-reported prevalence of smoking by the national Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System back to 1985.",
            "Before 1985, smoking prevalence rate estimates were extrapolated from the series of Surgeon General Reports back to 1964.",
            "The race, gender-specific cigarette smoking prevalence values were extrapolated back to 1953, applying Bayesian scaling from the respective year-specific lung cancer mortality rates.",
            "These lung cancer mortality estimates assume a constant risk relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer mortality risk.",
            "The focus for these analyses was for only Caucasian males as they represented the largest fraction of the PGDP cohort, and comprised 76% of the lung cancer deaths.",
            "Risk of a simple ecologic fallacy is patent with a localized workforce.",
            "Next, owing to the findings related to non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, we endeavored to account for the cancer risk in the cohort incorporating cancer cases who did not die from their disease.",
            "Mortality data alone incorporates a bias for survivability of the specific disease.",
            "In recent years the survivorship for NHL has improved dramatically.",
            "The person-years for the PGDP cohort were determined, in 5-year age increments, for 1995\u20132004.",
            "The Prevalence section of the National Cancer Institute's Statistical Report was used to derive approximate expected numbers of cases, for the 10-year period.",
            "These expected numbers were compared to the observed case counts, by site, as identified by the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR).",
            "This assessment was intended to be entirely descriptive in nature, so no hypothesis tests were performed.",
            "RESULTS",
            "The final worker file contained a total of 6820 workers of which 6766 workers had usable data.",

            "William Ogel, in 1885, is reported to have noted two issues when calculating death in industrial workers \u2014 \u201cconsiderable standard of muscular strength\u201d and \u201cvigour to be maintained\u201d: the healthy worker effect (HWE).",
            "Healthier workers will seek employment and because of their good health will continue to be employed.",
            "Thirty percent of the workers at the PGDP worked more than 40 years at the plant.",
            "The overall SMR of 0.76 speaks to the overall health of the PGDP workers.",
            "Due to TCE's complex mechanism of metabolism, observed effects and mode of action, there are many diverse views on the health risks of TCE.",
            "Based on numerous reviews, TCE has only been shown to be \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201creasonably anticipated to be\u201d carcinogenic to humans.",
            "The strongest links between TCE exposure and cancers is with liver cancer, kidney cancer, and lymphomas.",
            "None of the PGDP exposure groups showed a significant SMR for liver or kidney cancer (see Table 6).",
            "The workers in the TCE exposure group 0\u20133 did show a significant SMR for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of 1.76.",
            "The workers who experienced the highest exposures to TCE (exposure group 4 or 5) worked in the laboratory, as maintenance/electricians, in maintenance/lubrication, in waste operations or as chemical operators.",
            "Of these workers, those who were chemical operators, maintenance/electricians, and in maintenance/lubrication, were also exposed to elevated levels of arsenic, beryllium, hexavalent chromium, nickel, and uranium.",
            "The multiple exposures create difficulty in assigning the cause of health effects to any single agent such as TCE.",
            "One possible means of reducing the healthy worker effect is by making comparisons from within the cohort.",
            "Calculating the SRR provides this comparison.",
            "However, Arrighi found that even when using an internal reference group, the HWE still decreases the exposure effect.",
            "Using TCE 0 or TCE 1 as the reference groups showed no significant relationships between TCE and the five cancers reviewed.",
            "Mandel performed a meta-analysis of occupational TCE exposure with special emphasis on Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",
            "His analysis of standard relative risk estimates based on TCE exposure did not show an exposure response trend.",
            "Table 6 shows the SRRs for the cohort and three diseases.",
            "Note that TCE exposure category 2 (exposure 2 or 3) has higher SRRs than the other exposure categories.",
            "The leukemia SRRs do not follow this trend, but rather has its apex SRR at TCE exposure category 3 (exposure of 4 and 5).",
            "Possibly, higher exposed workers were \u2018protected\u2019 from their recognized leukemia risk from TCE exposure, while lesser exposed workers may have been less well protected.",
            "The concept of the healthy worker effect has been studied for over 100 years, but there is no agreed-upon method for controlling for this effect.",
            "However, it appears that the workers at the PGDP were not negatively affected by exposures based on the calculated SMRs.",
            "Based on these classic analyses, mortality due to chemical exposure is not apparent and overshadowed by the HWE.",
            "However, the HWE also poses a potential for superior medical surveillance compared to the general population.",
            "This may possibly lead to earlier disease detection and thus a potential for better survival.",
            "In the case of NHL, this selective worker benefit is implicated and poses reinforcement for a possible TCE exposure risk among moderately or less exposed workers.",
            "One particular recurring finding for the epidemiologic studies of the three U.S. gaseous diffusion plants is that of moderately elevated Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) among the cohort members.",
            "One effect of the HWE is that well-medically served employees at federal facilities are closely monitored, particularly for cancer risk, then cancer cases may be detected earlier and treated more successfully than in the general population.",
            "The lung cancer and prostate cancer patterns in Figures 4 and 5 offer illustrations of this HWE-related selection force (better medical surveillance) operating with cancers with respectively poor and excellent, screening detection potential and survival rates.",
            "Occupational studies would ascribe these lower mortality patterns to the HWE and perhaps look no farther into the experience, particularly if the number of events is relatively few.",
            "In Figure 5, all cancer site patterns for prevalence greatly outstrip the respective mortality patterns, generally reflecting the objective of this article that integration of the \u2018incidence fraction\u2019 of the force of morbidity with the mortality fraction produces more case outcomes to reason over.",
            "However, in Figure 4, one may see that NHL period prevalence surpasses its respective \u2018expected\u2019 prevalence, this is just as NHL did for its respective mortality experience (see Table 5).",
            "Consequently, the improved survivorship would act to lower the mortality risk (reducing the death count \u2014 lowering the SMR) to statistically marginal findings that may be dismissed as an artifact of the HWE.",
            "Then, when the NHL incidence also surpasses expectation, that segment of the selection force is effectively missed in occupational studies without population-based cancer registry support.",
            "The resulting impact being that a biologically credible risk relationship for NHL is \u2018diminished\u2019 in informative perspective of an occupational cohort where the \u2018true\u2019 excess NHL deaths (had the workforce survival not been greater than the general public's) are hidden among the incidence fraction.",
            "We believe this potential selection force needs further study, especially among the three gaseous diffusion plant cohorts.",
            "In Kentucky, the lung cancer mortality rates rose from the lowest quintile before 1970 to lead the nation by 1995.",
            "This article describes the impact of divergent secular trends (national versus state) upon the lung cancer mortality experience of workers at the Paducah (KY) Gaseous Diffusion Plant.",
            "During the cohort follow-up, the national pattern for lung cancer mortality is observed rather than the Kentucky trend.",
            "Such adjustment for regional behavioral risk factor prevalence is important with epidemiologic research to avoid a simple ecologic fallacy when studying a localized population, as a single industrial facility."

            "INTRODUCTION",
            "Vitamin D, also known as cholecalciferol, is a fat soluble vitamin, which plays a critical role in the maintenance of normal blood levels of calcium and phosphorous [1,2].",
            "It is rapidly metabolized in the liver to form 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) [3].",
            "Another hydroxylation of 25OHD takes place in the kidney through the action of 1-alpha hydroxylase enzyme, to yield 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25DOHD), which is the most potent vitamin D metabolite [3].",
            "While 1,25DOHD is the most potent vitamin D metabolite, levels of 25OHD reflect the body's vitamin D stores more accurately [4].",
            "A low 25OHD level is a major public health issue, with around one billion people worldwide affected [5].",
            "Workers Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland in cellular proliferation, and can also suppress cancer growth by induction of apoptosis or inhibition of angiogenesis [39,40].",
            "Also an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures among night workers has been reported.",
            "A group in the United States has revealed that night work for more than 20 years is associated with an elevated risk of hip and wrist fractures [27].",
            "Due to 25OHD role in bone health, and its association with the increased risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures in adults [5,41,42], this modest effect of night work on fracture risk may suggest a link between night work and 25OHD deficiency.",
            "The direct link between night work and the actual levels of 25OHD have been investigated in a few studies, where it has been found that 25OHD levels were significantly lower in night workers than in day workers [43][44][45][46].",
            "The main aim of this study is to assess the association between night work and 25OHD levels among Jordanian workers working in Jordan University Hospital (JUH) and The University of Jordan including: nurses, physicians, pharmacists and security officers.",
            "We also aimed at evaluation of the effect of several risk factors on 25OHD status.",
            "MATERIAL AND METHODS",
            "Study design and data collection",
            "This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted between June-July (summer), and November-December (winter) 2014.",
            "During the study period 160 adult employees, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were contacted at Jordan University Hospital and The University of Jordan.",
            "Only 140 employees agreed to participate in the study and to provide blood samples (response rate 88%) (Figure 1).",
            "This study was conducted following the guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.",
            "Verbal consent was obtained from each participant, and an institutional review board committee approval was sought from The University of Jordan.",
            "The sample was obtained using a convenient sampling technique.",
            "with 25OHD deficiency often complain of fatigue, myalgia and muscle pain [6].",
            "They reportedly think of these symptoms as a result of their working intensity, and they rarely associate it with 25OHD deficiency [7].",
            "The exact definition of 25OHD deficiency is still controversial.",
            "Most agree that < 20 ng/ml 25OHD levels are considered to be deficient, whereas 25OHD levels of 21-29 ng/ml are considered to indicate insufficiency, and levels > 30 ng/ml are considered to be sufficient [5,[8][9][10][11][12].",
            "A number of factors have been found to be associated with low 25OHD levels.",
            "These factors include, among others, low sun exposure, age, obesity, smoking, dress style in the case of women and physical activity [5,[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20].",
            "In the absence of adequate sun exposure, 25OHD levels may be insufficient to achieve the desired physiologic role [5,[21][22][23][24].",
            "It is, therefore, anticipated that working at night would affect employees' level of sun exposure, and subsequently, their 25OHD status.",
            "Approximately 20% of working populations in developed countries are night workers [25].",
            "Although the role of such workers, including: workers in healthcare, transportation and other industries, is vital, their working pattern can be associated with various adverse health outcomes, such as: diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases and other conditions [26][27][28][29][30][31][32].",
            "Several studies have shown that night work is associated with the increasing incidence of different types of cancer, mainly breast cancer [33,34], but still the link between night work and breast cancer is insufficient [35].",
            "It has been suggested that 1,25DOHD plays a role in the increased risk of cancer associated with night-shift work, where the reduction in melatonin concentrations due to night shift work may reduce ligand-induced transcriptional activity of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) [36,37].",
            "This reduction in VDR results in suppressing the negative-growth regulation by 1,25DOHD, which may increase cancer incidence [38].",
            "It has been found that 1,25DOHD is associated with reduction",
            "The serum samples were thawed in a dry bath at 37\u00b0C immediately prior to the analysis.",
            "Then a 25OHD level in each sample was measured using the automated immunoassay technique (AIA-1800 analyzer, Tosoh, Japan).",
            "Each patient was given a sample cup number and the result was printed referring to each sample cup number; the level of 25OHD was expressed in ng/ml.",
            "For the levels and results that were lesser than functional sensitivity, the results were reported and printed as < 4 ng/ml.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "All the data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 19 (SPSS, Inc., USA).",
            "Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were presented as means \u00b1 standard deviation (M\u00b1SD).",
            "Since the data were normally distributed as evident by their skewness, kurtosis, histogram and the normal probability-probability plot (P-P plot), the independent sample t-test was used to investigate any differences in 25OHD levels among the day and night workers.",
            "The Chi 2 analysis was used to analyze categorical independent variables.",
            "A simple linear regression was used to identify any factors that may significantly affect 25OHD levels among the study participants.",
            "Checking for outliers, normality, linearity was performed by means of the methods described by Tabachnick and Fidell (2013) [47].",
            "For all statistical analyses, a p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
            "All the tests were two-tailed.",
            "Due to occupational gender segregation reported in the literature, all the analyses were conducted stratified by gender [48].",
            "RESULTS",
            "One hundred forty Jordanian employees were recruited in this study, from whom 82 were classified as night workers and 58 as day workers.",
            "Fifty-seven percent of the sample",
            "The study sample was recruited by well-trained assistants.",
            "Information regarding demographic data, marital status, educational level, working patterns, smoking habits and the level of any physical activity was obtained using a structured questionnaire.",
            "Average numbers of night shift/ month were obtained from the administrative records for all the employees.",
            "Then, the participants were categorized into two groups based on their working pattern; day workers (subjects working from 7:00 a.m. till 4:00 p.m. without any shift work), and night workers (subjects working from 4:00 p.m. till 7:00 a.m. at least 4 times per month for at least 3 years).",

            "Serum 25OHD measurement",
            "Blood samples (5 ml) for 25OHD measurement were drawn from the brachial vein from all the participants.",
            "The samples were allowed to clot for 2 h at room temperature, and then the serum was separated by centrifugation at a speed of 4000 rotations per minute (rpm) for 10 min and divided into aliquot of 1 ml.",
            "Aliquots were frozen at -80\u00b0C until 25OHD analysis was performed.",
            "Mean 25OHD level among the study sample was 24 ng/ml.",
            "Forty-seven percent of the study subjects was found to have 25OHD deficiency, with levels \u2264 20 ng/ml, and around 24% had insufficient 25OHD levels (21-29 ng/ml) (Table 1).",
            "It was found that 25OHD levels were females; the mean age of the subjects was 34 years.",
            "Seventy-five percent of the studied sample were married and around 24% were smokers.",

            "The number of night shifts/month was negatively correlated with 25OHD levels in both the males and females (p = 0.01 and p = 0.007, respectively), while age was positively correlated with 25OHD levels (p = 0.02 and p = 0.001, respectively).",
            "Although the results showed no association between BMI and 25OHD levels within each gender group (p = 0.21 for males and p = 0.09 for females), this association existed in the sample as a whole, where a significant negative correlation between obesity and 25OHD levels was found (p = 0.03).",

            "Table 2 shows 25OHD profile among the study sample based on a working pattern.",
            "The night workers had significantly lower mean 25OHD levels (21 ng/ml) compared to the day workers (28 ng/ml) (p = 0.003), with over half of them (55%) having deficient levels of 25OHD compared to 38% within the day work group.",
            "This effect was significant both in the winter and in the summer.",
            "The simple linear regression was used to identify any factors that may significantly affect 25OHD levels among the study participants (Table 3).",
            "The effect of age, night work, number of night shift/month, exercise, smoking and body mass index (BMI) on 25OHD levels was investigated.",
            "The female night workers had significantly significant difference in 25OHD levels between the summer and winter in our results [52].",
            "The association between 25OHD levels and gender is controversial.",

            "Dress style in the case of females was independently affecting 25OHD status; where women wearing hijab or niqab were at higher risk of low 25OHD levels than those dressed as western women [20].",
            "Despite this finding, our results showed no significant difference in 25OHD levels between the males and females; mean 25OHD levels were 23 ng/ml (SD = 10) and 25 ng/ml (SD = 15) in the males and females, respectively.",
            "Hypp\u00f6nen et al. have reported, in a nationwide study, that in British adults the association between gender and 25OHD levels depended on the month of measurement, showing lower 25OHD levels in females only during the summer and fall.",

            "The main aim of this study was to investigate the association between working patterns and 25OHD levels among Jordanian workers.",
            "The effect of other factors was also investigated.",
            "Our study sample presented a mean serum 25OHD level of 24 ng/ml (standard deviation (SD) = 13), indicating insufficient 25OHD levels.",
            "The literature has reported a wide variation across studies assessing mean 25OHD levels among different populations.",
            "A systematic review involving 195 studies conducted in 44 countries, has found that the mean population-level of 25OHD ranges 1.96-54.5 ng/ml, with 88% of the studies reporting inadequate mean values < 30 ng/ml [49].",
            "In our sample, no significant difference was found in 25OHD levels between the summer and winter; mean 25OHD levels were 24 ng/ml (SD = 14) and 22 ng/ml (SD = 9), respectively.",
            "This finding was inconsistent with previous findings that individuals could have adequate 25OHD levels in the summer months but suboptimal levels in the winter [50,51].",
            "Since the latitude of Amman (Jordan) is 31\u00b0N, cutaneous 25OHD synthesis is almost similar all year round, which can explain lack of **",
            "When \u03b2 is positive this means that there is direct relationship between 25OHD level and independent variable, while negative \u03b2 means that there is inverse relationship between 25OHD level and independent variable.",
            "A higher risk of 25OHD deficiency in subjects working at night can be a result of the reduced solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance due to daytime sleeping as described by the literature [53,56].",
            "It is recommended that the maximum daily 25OHD levels are achievable through casual midday/lunch hour sun exposure [17].",
            "Due to their working hours and daytime sleeping, most night workers do not get exposed to adequate sunlight during this time of the day, and as a result they may be at higher risk of developing 25OHD deficiency.",
            "In our study, the number of night shift/month was associated with lower 25OHD levels.",
            "This result was expected, since the workers with higher number of nights/month have lower duration of sun exposure.",
            "We investigated the effect of some risk factors on 25OHD levels.",
            "Our results showed a positive correlation between age and serum 25OHD levels for both the males and females.",
            "Age was shown to be positively associated with 25OHD levels in previous reports [15,55].",
            "Lower serum 25OHD levels in younger individuals has been suggested to be associated with their lower forearm bone mineral content [15].",
            "On the contrary, other studies have shown higher 25OHD levels in younger individuals [57,58].",
            "The present study showed that higher BMI is associated with lower basal 25OHD in the sample as a whole.",
            "This is consistent with the reported in the literature negative association between 25OHD levels and obesity [59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66].",
            "This effect was not evident for each gender group; this may be due to a small sample size in each group.",
            "Although the mechanism underlying an increased risk of 25OHD deficiency in obesity is uncertain, it has been suggested that the metabolic clearance of 25OHD levels may increase in obesity.",
            "This clearance has been suggested to be through enhanced uptake by adipose tissue [67], which results in lower bioavailability of 25OHD from cutaneous and dietary sources due to its deposition in body fat compartments [59].",
            "Other study has suggested that and Japan have shown that 25OHD deficiency is largely attributed to female sex [18,55].",
            "The overall night workers had significantly lower mean 25OHD levels (21 ng/ml, SD = 12) compared to the day workers (28 ng/ml, SD = 14).",
            "This effect was significant both in the winter and summer.",
            "However, no significant difference in serum 25OHD levels was found between the night and day male workers, while the female night workers had lower serum 25OHD levels compared to the female day workers.",
            "This result was consistent with previous findings [43][44][45][46].",
            "Physical activity had no significant correlation with serum 25OHD levels for the sample as a whole; however, the males with a sedentary lifestyle showed significantly higher serum 25OHD levels.",
            "No significant association was detected in the female workers.",
            "This result was inconsistent with a previous study; which has shown that 25OHD deficiency is attributed to a sedentary lifestyle [13].",
            "Smoking had no significant correlation with serum 25OHD levels in both the males and females.",
            "Our results were in agreement with a previous study that has shown no correlation between smoking and 25OHD levels [45].",
            "On the other hand, other studies have shown a significant correlation between 25OHD deficiency and smoking [18,68].",
            "The relatively small prevalence of smokers among our sample, along with the small sample size might be attributed to the lack of statistical power to detect any association between smoking and 25OHD levels.",
            "Finally, since low 25OHD status is associated with an increased risk of different diseases [5,33,34,41,42], 25OHD supplementation to night workers has been suggested to prevent such diseases and to improve their health status [39].",
            "However, health effects of long term exposure to high levels of 25OHD are largely unknown, which necessitates appropriate monitoring while providing such supplements.",
            "It is also recommended to encourage this category of workers to have more adequate sun exposure.",
            "It is worth mentioning, that we are aware of some methodological weaknesses of our study, especially the relatively small sample size of the study participants.",
            "The strict inclusion criteria of the night workers, where they had to be working from 9:00 p.m. till 7:00 a.m. at least 4 times per month, for at least 3 years, resulted in a limited number of individuals meeting the inclusion criteria.",

            "In contrast to Clark et al., however, we could not induce expression of HLA-DR after incubation with IFN-% Second, it could be demonstrated that FLCL display functional properties that are characteristic for human FDC.",

            "In general, the tendency of low-density B cells to adhere to FLCL was two to three times higher than of high-density B cells.",
            "We observed that the adherence of B cells to FLCL was very intimate and closely resembled the pattern of emperipolesis described by others for both in vivo as well as in vitro studies (30,32,40) for the interaction of B cells and FDC.",

            "This is in line with other reports (13,31).",
            "Staining of cultures of FLCL and B cells with Hoechst 33258 revealed that B cells binding to FLCL were prevented from apoptosis, whereas the vast majority of nonbinding cells displayed an apoptotic appearance (84% of the nonbinding lowdensity B cells and 69% of the high-density B cells) (Fig. 5 and Table 4).",

            "The difference found in apoptotic cells between low-density and high-density B cells is in line with experiments done by other groups in which it was demonstrated that germinal center B cells, in contrast to mantle zone B cells, die rapidly by apoptosis upon culture in vitro (41,42).",
            "Furthermore it was observed that B cell proliferation in vitro was inhibited if B cells were stimulated in the presence of FLCL and not in the presence of HFB (Table 6).",
            "Part of the inhibitory effect of FLCL may be caused by soluble factors as the presence of FLCL-derived culture supernatants often resulted in decreased proliferation o r b cells (Table 7).",

            "Previous studies in both the murine and human system, however, have suggested that FDC-em'iched cell preparations may enhance B cell proliferation in vitro (32,(43)(44)(45).",
            "These contrasting results may be explained as follows: in vivo, FDC mainly are present in the light zone of germinal centers.",
            "In the dark zone of germinal centers, B cell proliferate very rapidly while only few FDC with low ICAM-1 expression are present.",
            "In the basal part of the light zone FDC form a dense network of high ICAM-l-positive cells (3).",
            "During germinal center reactions, it is in this latter area that the rapid proliferation of B cells is downregulated in close contact with FDC or in the close vicinity of FDC, suggesting an inhibitory effect of high ICAM-1 expressing FDC (which may be caused by soluble factors) on B cell proliferation.",
            "The present results therefore may reflect the actions of high ICAM-l-positive FDC in the basal light zone.",

            "T he transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP)   is encoded by the TAP-I and -2 genes (1, 2), located within the class II MHC region.",
            "Their products share structural properties with members of the superfamily of ATP-binding transporters (2,3) and their function is to translocate antigenic peptide from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (Elk).",
            "There, class I H chain, L chain (B2-microglobulin), and peptide assemble into a complex which is then transported to the cell surface.",
            "Mutant cell lines (4,5) or mice (6) lacking TAP-1 and/or -2 genes do not present antigen to CD8 + Tcells and show strongly reduced levels of surface class I MHC molecules, indicating that peptide should be considered the essential third subunit of the class I complex (7)(8)(9).",

            "Loss of class I MHC expression has been observed frequently in malignant cells of different origin (12) and in virally transformed ceils (13).",
            "Such loss would allow these cells to escape from CTL-mediated killing and consequently increase their oncogenic potential.",
            "Downregulation of class I MHC surface expression is often related to transcriptional inhibition of H (14,15) or L ( 16) chain gene expression.",
            "In virally infected cells, additional posttranscriptional mechanisms may result in the retention of class I MHC complexes in the ER, such as binding of H chains by the adenovirus E3 glycoprotein (17,18) or binding of H and/or L chains by cytomegalovirus H301 (19) or other proteins (20) (Bijlmakers, M. J., T. Beersma, and H. L. Ploegh, unpublished observations).",
            "Besides deprivation of H and/or L chains, the loss of peptide could also result in reduced class I MHC surface expression.",
            "Downregulation of class I MHC expression has been found in a substantial number of cervical carcinomas, containing human papilloma-virus type 16 DNA (21,22).",
            "Since the presence of H chain and 32-microglobulin transcripts was observed by RNA in situ hybridization in neoplastic cervical cells that show loss of class I MHC surface expression, a posttranscriptional regulation has been postulated (23).",
            "Loss of TAP function and the consequent failure to produce stable class I MHC molecules could be an explanation.",
            "Therefore in this study, class I MHC and TAP-1 expression were examined in 76 carcinomas of the uterine cervix by immunohistochemistry with class I H chain-specific mAbs and a polyclonal antiserum raised against a bacterial glutathione~S-transferase (GST)/human TAP-1 fusion protein.",

            "Specificity of the serum for TAP-1 protein was demonstrated by the lack of reactivity in Western blots from T2 cells, which are devoid of TAP-1 protein (4,5).",
            "Transfection with the TAP-1 cDNA restored reactivity with the anti-TAP-1 serum (27) (Heemels, M. T., and H. L. Ploegh, unpublished observations).",
            "Specificity of the immunocytochemical staining with the TAP-1 antiserum was further confirmed by the lack of staining of cytospins of TAP-1/-2-negative T2 cells (data not shown).",
            "TAP-I Immunohistochemistry.",
            "The serum was used for immunohistochemical detection of TAP-1 protein in formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded (n = 16), and acetone-fixed, snapfrozen (n = 60) tissue sections of cervical carcinomas.",
            "Normal epithelial cells, present in the same section, and infiltrating cells of the immune system, always stained positively.",
            "In neoplastic cells, three different TAP-1 expression patterns could be observed.",
            "Complete loss of TAP-1 expression in virtually all neoplastic cells was observed in 4 out of 16 paraffinembedded and 11 out of 60 frozen carcinomas.",
            "In 9 paraffinembedded and 13 frozen carcinomas, heterogeneous loss of TAP-1 expression in neoplastic cells was found.",
            "Positively staining tumor areas could be observed adjacent to areas that dearly show loss of staining (Fig. 2 A).",
            "Staining for TAP-1 protein was localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 B), which is in accordance with the proposed E R localization of the TAP-1 subunit (28).",
            "The remaining three paraffin-embedded and 36 frozen carcinomas were uniformly positive for TAP-1 protein.",
            "Preliminary R N A in situ hybridization data employing a TAP-l-specific probe indicate that loss of staining for TAP-1 protein is related to reduced signals for TAP-1 m R N A (Cromme, F. V., and J. M. M . Walboomers, unpublished observations), further confirming that negative immunohistochemical staining with the TAP-1 serum represents reduced steady state levels of TAP-1 protein.",
            "Summary of the immunohistochemical staining results for TAP-1 and HLA expression of 76 cervical carcinomas (73 squamous cell and 3 adenocarcinomas), as determined with antibodies HC-A2 (HLA-A), W6/32 (HLA-A/B/C), and HC10 (HLA-B/C).",
            "Three TAP-1/HLA phenotypes were recognized: positive ( + ), when virtually all cells are labeled; negative ( -), when virtually all neoplastic cells show loss of staining as compared to normal epithelial and infiltrating immune cells in the same section; heterogeneous ( + / -), when positively staining tumor areas were observed adjacent to negatively staining areas, usually between 25 and 75% of the neoplastic cells in a specimen.",
            "When the TAP-1 and HLA phenotypes are identical (bold numbers), this indicates congruency at the single cell level.",

            "* Pattern confirmed with antibodies 4E, Bw4, and Bw6. to class I MHC expression are summarized in Table 1.",
            "Class I MHC expression was studied on consecutive tissue sections using HLA-A and -B H chain locus-specific mAbs (HC-A2 and HC10, respectively) in the paraffm-embedded specimens.",
            "Frozen tissues wire analyzed using an antibody recognizing complexed HLA-A/B/C locus products (W6/32) and antibodies specific mainly for HLA-B/C H chains (HC10, 4E).",
            "In most cases, Bw4-and Bw6-specific antibodies confirmed the staining pattern obtained with HC10 and 4E, indicating that the latter two antibodies mainly react with B locus products in immunohistochemistry.",
            "In general, the pattern of HLA expression was similar to that of TAP-l, as shown with HCI0 in Fig. 2 C. Areas that show loss of staining for TAP-1 (Fig. 2 A) are also negative for HLA-B (Fig. 2 C).",
            "Immunohistochemical double staining procedures revealed a simultaneous loss of TAP-1 and HLA-B expression at the single cell level (Fig. 2 D).",
            "Staining for class I has predominantly a membranous localization (blue), whereas TAP-1 protein is detected in the cytoplasm of the same neo-plastic cells (brown).",
            "From the 37 carcinomas that show heterogeneous or total loss of TAP-1 expression, HLA-B locus expression was congruently lost in 35 cases (Table 1, HC10 column).",
            "No examples of expression of HLA-B locus products with loss of TAP-1 protein were seen, indicating that cell surface expression of HLA-B alleles in vivo strongly depends on TAP functioning.",
            "However, six carcinomas showed positive staining with W6/32 whereas TAP expression was lost (Table 1, i.e., four W6/32 positive and two W6/32 heterogenous carcinomas).",
            "A typical example is shown in Fig.",
            "3. Neoplastic cells clearly exhibit positive staining with W6/32 (Fig. 3 A), whereas TAP-1 protein cannot be detected (Fig. 3 B).",
            "Since the identical area is also negative for HLA-B/C expression (data not shown), at least some HLA-A alteles can probably be stably expressed at the cell surface in the absence of TAP-1 protein in cervical carcinomas.",
            "HLA serotyping of these six patients revealed HLA-A2 positivity in three cases (Keating, P. J., F. V. Cromme, P. L. Stern, and P. A. Dyer, unpublished observations).",
            "This is in accordance with the residual HLA-A2 expression observed in the human T2 cell line, which is devoid of TAP-1 protein (29,30).",
            "The expression of other HLA-A alleles in the remaining three lesions indicates that additional A locus products besides HLA-A2 can be stabilized in the absence of TAP-1.",
            "Furthermore, eight carcinomas lack single cell congruency between TAP-1 and HLA expression, since they show reduced levels of HLA-A or -B expression while TAP-1 protein can be detected (Table 1, i.e., two HC-A2, one W6/32, and five HC10 negative cases).",
            "Because HLA-A and -B locusspecific transcripts could be detected in all carcinomas analyzed with RNA in situ hybridization (23), additional posttranscriptional mechanisms besides loss of TAP-1 might be involved that interfere with peptide loading of class I MHC molecules in the ER.",
            "These may include loss ofpeptide processing, loss of TAP-2, or lack of additional cytosolic factors, necessary for peptide translocation.",
            "In conclusion, results from this study indicate that downregulation of peptide transport may constitute a mechanism by which malignant cells escape killing by CTL.",
            "Absence of TAP-l/-2 expression accompanied by loss of class I MHC expression has recently been reported in small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (31).",
            "This report shows that this phenomenon occurs in human malignancies in situ.",
            "In addition, the observed high correlation between TAP-1 and class I MHC downregulation may to a large extent explain the posttranscriptional control of class I MHC expression frequently observed in cervical carcinomas.",
            "Preliminary results on lung (n = 10), colon (n = 5), and mammary (n = 5) carcinomas indicate that loss of immunoreactivity for TAP-1 is not only restricted to cervical carcinomas, but seems to be a more general phenomenon.",

            "Objectives",
            "The aim of this study was to examine chromosome aberrations in 25 tunnel workers exposed to acrylamide-containing grout in injection work.",
            "Methods Blood samples were collected from 25 exposed and 25 unexposed tunnel workers matched for age, gender, and smoking habits.",
            "Whole blood was cultured for 50-53 hours according to conventional methods.",
            "Chromosome damage was scored in 200 metaphases per person on coded slides.",
            "The distribution of glutathione S-transferase (GST) genotypes (M1 and T1) was examined for all the workers.",
            "Exposure assessment was performed with detailed interviews and questionnaires.",
            "Results",
            "The chromosome examinations showed no statistically significant differences between the 25 exposed and 25 unexposed workers for cells with chromosome aberrations or for chromatid breaks, chromosome breaks, and chromosome gaps.",
            "The exposed workers had a significantly higher number of chromatid gaps (mean 10.6, SD 5.6) than the unexposed workers (mean 6.4, SD 4.4, P=0.004), but there was no exposure-response relationship.",
            "The limited stratum-specific numbers showed that the exposed workers with the GSTM1-/GSTT1genotype had nonsignificantly higher frequencies of all the effect parameters than the unexposed workers; this finding indicates that individual susceptibility related to the detoxification of acrylamide and N-methylolacrylamide may have played a role in the observed effect.",
            "Conclusions",
            "No increase in chromosome breaks or aberrations was observed for 25 workers exposed to acrylamide-containing grout during tunnel work.",
            "The increased frequency of chromatid gaps in the exposed workers may indicate a slight genotoxic effect related to exposure to acrylamide or N-methylolacrylamide.",
            "Monomeric acrylamide is neurotoxic and probably carcinogenic to humans.",
            "In addition, reproductive effects have been shown in animals (1,2).",
            "Recently, there has been public concern about the potential health risks related to the dietary intake of acrylamide (3,4).",
            "However, epidemiologic studies have primarily focused on occupational exposure, by examining neurotoxic effects (5)(6)(7) or cancer incidence related to acrylamide exposure (8).",
            "Evidence that acrylamide induces chromosome effects was reported by Shiraishi in 1978 (9).",
            "Acrylamide has a clastogenic potential that affects both germ cells and somatic cells (10)(11)(12)(13).",
            "It is primarily conjugated with gluthathione and is excreted as mercapturic acid (n-acetyl-cystein conjugate).",
            "A proportion is oxidized to glycidamide through the cytochrome P-450 system (CYP2E1) (14).",
            "Glycidamide is highly reactive, particularly against free thiol groups, and is excreted in conjugated forms.",
            "It is uncertain whether metabolic activation is required for acrylamide to exert its genotoxic effect, although several studies suggest a possible directacting mechanism for acrylamide (10,11).",
            "Acrylamide-containing grouts have been used in tunnel construction work for several decades in order to prevent water leakage into the tunnel.",
            "Due to the toxic properties of acrylamide, several other grouts have been developed, including one based on the less toxic Nmethylolacrylamide (NMA).",
            "Exposure to the alternative NMA grout still, however, implies exposure to pure acrylamide (6).",
            "Thus occupational exposure to acrylamidecontaining grouts may present a hazard to workers, through inhalation or, probably more importantly, through dermal exposure.",
            "During 1995-1997, 340 000 kilograms of an NMAbased grouting agent, Rhoca-Gil (Sipro-Gel) was used for injection during the construction of a railway tunnel 14 kilometers in length.",
            "We have recently reported nervous system effects in 25 of the workers exposed to acrylamide and N-methylolacrylamide during this grouting work (7).",
            "The aim of the present study was to examine possible genotoxic effects in tunnel workers with relevant exposure to acrylamide-containing grout during a 2-year period.",
            "We have also examined chromosome aberrations related to polymorphism in the glutathione-Stransferase (GST) genotypes M and T in that the results may be of particular interest with respect to the biotransformation of acrylamide (11).",
            "Study population and methods",
            "The study base consisted of 73 tunnel workers who had been potentially exposed to NMA grout during tunnel work in a 2-year period from 1995 to 1997.",
            "Due to the media focus on possible health effects related to acrylamide exposure during the autumn of 1997, these 73 workers participated in a health examination at occupational health services during October 1997-January 1998.",
            "Among these workers, we identified the 25 persons with the highest exposure to acrylamide-containing grout.",
            "Those with known neurological disease or known alcohol or drug abuse were not eligible for the study.",
            "Twenty-five tunnel workers who had not been exposed to NMA grouts, matched for age (\u00b13 years), gender, and smoking status were selected as controls.",
            "Two exposed workers who had stopped smoking just prior to the examination were matched with smoking unexposed workers.",
            "The distribution of age, lifestyle factors, years in construction work, and other relevant exposure factors are presented in table 1.",
            "The project was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee, and all the workers gave their written informed consent to participate in the study.",
            "Chromosome examination",
            "Chromosome studies were performed for 25 exposed and 25 unexposed workers.",
            "Since it was impossible to collect blood samples from the exposed worker and matched unexposed worker on the same day, 31 reference blood samples were collected from seven staff members at the National Institute of Occupational Health to control for possible postal and culture factors.",
            "Samples of 10 ml of heparinized blood from two exposed or unexposed workers, together with one reference sample, were collected on the same day and sent by mail for delivery to the Telemark Hospital the next day.",
            "Four whole-blood lymphocyte cultures per sample were established.",
            "They were cultured for 50-53 hours and processed as described previously (15).",
            "Slides were coded and stained in Giemsa, and chromosome damage was scored in 200 metaphases per person.",
            "The chromosome results are reported as the number of cells with aberrations (excluding gaps) and the number of chromatid breaks, chromosome breaks, chromatid gaps, and chromosome gaps, all as group means per 200 cells.",
            "A gap was defined as an unstained region of less width than the width of two chromatids (16).",
            "The results for the 31 reference samples (footnote to table 2), gave no  indications of any methodological problems related to postal or culture factors.",

            "DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) was extracted from 100 \u00b5l of blood, and the polymorphic regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using previously described methods (17).",
            "The PCR products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis using internal size standards.",
            "Genotypes consisting of homozygote deletions were indicated as GSTM1-and GSTT1-.",

            "Grouting agent and exposure conditions",
            "The grout was based on two solutions.",
            "Solution 1 consisted of 26-31% N-methylolacrylamide, 2.5-5.4% acrylamide, 0.02-0.03% methylene-bis-acrylamide, 12-17% methylic diesters (catalyst), 0.9% formaldehyde, and water.",
            "Solution 2 contained sodium silicate, sodium persulfate, and water.",
            "Due to the low temperature in the tunnel, however, polymerization could be considerably delayed, and exposure to the mixed, but not yet polymerized, product could occur.",
            "All 25 of the exposed workers had taken active part in the injection of grouting agents for an average of 586 (range 243-724) days.",
            "The median value was 639 days.",
            "Ten of the twelve workers exposed above the median value were exposed for 724 days, while seven of the thirteen workers exposed below the median were exposed for less than 500 days.",
            "Twenty of the twenty-five exposed workers reported direct skin contact with acrylamide grout, while all of the exposed workers stated that they had skin contact with tunnel water.",
            "Further details of the exposure conditions in the tunnel have been presented elsewhere (7,18).",
            "Exposure assessment",
            "Measurements of acrylamide and N-methylolacrylamide in tunnel water.",
            "Due to the technical and environmental problems of water leakage into the tunnel, the digging work came to a halt on 25 August 1997.",
            "Before this date, only a few sporadic measurements of acrylamide had been made in the drainage water from the tunnel.",
            "The highest concentrations were measured on 25 August, with an acrylamide concentration of 9654 \u00b5g/l and a NMA level of 16 600 \u00b5g/l (7).",
            "During September, the average concentration of acrylamide was 100-110 \u00b5g/l, while during October 1997-April 1998 most of the measurements were below 50 \u00b5g/l.",
            "However, in January 1998, during the injection of other grouting agents, several drill holes with unpolymerized grout were discovered.",
            "Very high concentrations of acrylamide were measured in the water dripping from these holes in the tunnel wall (up to 90 600 \u00b5g/l).",
            "Qualitative exposure information.",
            "Using the information obtained from the questionnaires, we estimated the accumulated time for tunnel work for each worker [\"tunnel time\" in months] and the accumulated time for injection work [\"injection time\" in days] during the period September 1995-August 1997.",
            "Using information about the amount of grout used in the different periods, we also developed a time-weighted \"exposure-time index\" based on the amount of grout used in the different periods (7).",
            "Statistical methods.",
            "Mann-Whitney's nonparametric ranking test was used for comparison between the groups in the chromosome studies.",
            "In order to create a crude exposure contrast, we divided the 25 exposed workers into a long-term exposure group (above the median of 639 days of injection, N=12) and a short-term exposure group (below 639 days of injection, N=13).",
            "A stepwise linear regression was also applied.",
            "The level of statistical significance was set two-tailed at P<0.05.",
            "The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was applied using a personal computer.",
            "Results",
            "Comparisons between all the exposed and unexposed workers are shown in table 2.",
            "There were no striking differences between the groups.",
            "Only the number of chromatid gaps differed significantly between the matched exposed and unexposed workers.",
            "In order to look for a possible skewed distribution of aberrations between the groups, we compared the number of persons with \u22653 aberrations.",
            "A slightly higher number of exposed persons was found with the number of cells with aberrations above the cut point, 14 exposed versus 9 unexposed.",
            "The distribution of the chromosome results according to the length of exposure and smoking habits is shown in table 3.",
            "There were no differences between the long-term (\u2265639 days) and short-term (<639 days) exposure groups.",
            "For the chromatid gaps there was a nonsignificant difference between the workers exposed long-term and their matched controls, and a significant difference was found between the workers exposed short-term and their matched controls.",
            "Comparing the exposed smokers and nonsmokers with their respective controls did not reveal any significant differences except for chromatid gaps.",
            "We also stratified the workers according to genotype (GSTM1 and GSTT1).",
            "Among the workers with GSTM1-, a statistically significant increase in chromatid gaps was observed for the exposed workers when they were compared with the unexposed workers (12.2 versus 6.5, P=0.02), but not for the corresponding groups among the workers with GSTM1+ (8.8 versus 6.3, P=0.08) (table 4).",
            "When the groups were further stratified for smoking, the observed difference in chromatid gaps among the GSTM1-exposed and unexposed workers was observed both among the nonsmokers (11.6 versus 4.6, P=0.02) and the smokers (13.0 versus 8.7, P=0.45) (data not shown).",
            "There was a corresponding pattern when the GSTT1 genotype was stratified for, the highest number of chromatid gaps occurring in the exposed workers with GSTT1-in a comparison with the corresponding controls (16.3 versus 9.6, P=0.19) (data not shown).",
            "We did not stratify the workers according to smoking habits for genotype GSTT1, as the number of persons was too small.",
            "The same trend was observed when the workers were grouped according to both GSTT1 and GSTM1, the biggest absolute difference in the number of chromatid gaps occurring between the exposed workers with GSTM1-/GSTT1-and their corresponding controls (16.3 versus 8.7) (table 5).",
            "A corresponding nonsignificant trend was also observed for cells with chromosome aberrations (3.8 versus 1.3), chromatid breaks (1.8 versus 0.3), chromosome breaks (1.8 versus 0.7), and chromosome gaps (2.3 versus 1.7).",
            "Using the number of chromatid gaps as the dependent variable, we performed a stepwise linear regression analysis with the parameters exposed/controls, smoker/ nonsmoker, use of medication (yes/no), GSTM1+/ GSTM1-, GSTT1+/GSTT1-in the model.",
            "The exposure status and genotype GSTT1 were significant for the  number of chromatid gaps only with P=0.002 and P=0.004, respectively.",
            "In a separate analysis, using GSTT1 in combination with the injection time and exposure-time index, respectively, as the continuous variables for the exposed group, only GSTT1-proved to be significant for the number of chromatid gaps (P=0.02).",
            "Discussion",
            "A direct measure of damage to cells after occupational exposure to genotoxic agents can be obtained with chromosome studies.",
            "An association between a high amount of chromosome damage in lymphocytes and cancer has been shown (19,20), indicating the relevance of these measures as predictors for carcinogenic risk.",
            "Lymphocyte populations in humans seem to have a longer life-span than previously considered (21,22), which gives the possibility of scoring the effects for recent, but not prevailing, exposure.",
            "In addition, the metabolite glycidamide is a relatively stable epoxide with a long halftime in vivo, and some studies have suggested that this metabolite is the active chromosome-damaging agent after acrylamide exposure (11).",
            "Although the acrylamide injection work was stopped before the blood samples were taken, the workers were still exposed to small amounts of unpolymerized grout from the NMA-based grouting agent, as high concentrations of acrylamide were measured in tunnel water after the grouting agent was abandoned.",
            "These arguments were the background for studying chromosome aberrations in this group of acrylamide-exposed tunnel workers.",
            "Of the selected outcome parameters used in our study, only cells with aberrations including both chromatid breaks and chromosome breaks have previously been shown to be of any relevance to possible health effects (19,20).",
            "Recently the same predictivity has been shown for chromatid breaks and chromosome breaks separately (23).",
            "We did not find any consistent significant differences between the matched exposed and unexposed workers for these three effect parameters in relation to exposure time and smoking status.",
            "Only three of the workers had clearly elevated adduct levels (7).",
            "They did not have higher levels of chromosome aberrations than the remainder of the exposed workers.",
            "Using the crude, semi-quantitative exposure information gave no further indications of any exposure-response relationship.",
            "The only consistent significant finding in our study was the observed increase in chromatid gaps among the exposed workers.",
            "This finding was independent of a crude, dichotomized variable for exposure length and could not be explained by smoking status.",
            "As both acrylamide and glycidamide have the ability to form adducts with DNA, they can be expressed as chromatid gaps or breaks after one cell cycle in culture.",
            "A gap is formed when a section of a chromatid becomes attenuated so that there appears to be a discontinuity where the two adjacent regions are still connected, but the DNA thread is so fine that it seems invisible (24).",
            "Although chromatid gaps may be indicative of damage to DNA as a result of exposure, as was also shown by Lander et al (25), we have no documentation for a connection between this parameter and possible health effects.",
            "However, it has recently been recommended that such analyses should be included in studies of the genotoxic effects of environmental agents (26) in particular since the definition of gaps may vary between studies (16,27,28).",
            "In our study a gap was defined to be the width of two chromatids (16), while other studies have scored gaps as the width of one chromatid.",
            "Our study may therefore include gap lesions that some other laboratories would score as breaks.",
            "Glutathione may play an important role in the detoxification of acrylamide (29), at least in the nervous system (30).",
            "In Norway, about 50% of the population lacks GSTM1 activity and 15% lacks GSTT1 activity due to genetic deletion polymorphism.",
            "These people may, in theory, have an increased risk for injuries caused by acrylamide.",
            "Since many GST genotypes are potentially involved in the detoxification of acrylamide and glycidamide, only a weak effect could be expected if one of them was lacking.",
            "When the workers were grouped according to genotype, the numbers decreased drastically, and it was difficult to demonstrate any statistically significant differences between the groups.",
            "However, for the exposed workers with GSTM1-/GSTT1-, a trend toward higher frequencies for the all the effect parameters in the exposed group was indicated when compared with the unexposed group with the same genotype (table 5).",
            "It is also of interest that GSTT1, which, in a kinetic study in our laboratory, has been shown to have the highest affinity for acrylamide (31), was the only genotype that proved to be significant for the number of chromatid gaps in the stepwise linear regression analysis.",
            "However, the kinetic parameters of different GST genotypes are not sufficient for evaluating their importance in vivo since the relative expression level in the target cells, which is an important determinant, is still an unknown factor.",
            "The interpretation of the limited data of our study, which were analyzed in relation to GST genotypes, should therefore be made with care.",
            "The most consistent findings related to the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes concerned the number of chromatid gaps (table 4 and5).",
            "These data may indicate that people with intact genes (active enzymes) are less prone to such chromosome aberrations when exposed to acrylamide.",
            "With regard to comparability, both the exposed and unexposed groups were experienced construction workers who were expected to have similar exposures and lifestyles.",
            "Corresponding age and smoking habits were secured by a matching procedure.",
            "There were, however, some differences in the reported exposure to other factors between the groups, mainly with higher reported frequencies among the unexposed workers.",
            "The observed difference in the number of chromatid gaps between the groups was not related to alcohol consumption.",
            "More unexposed than exposed persons used medication regularly, but, for both groups, the people using medication had lower frequencies of all types of chromosome aberrations than the people not using medication.",
            "In 25 tunnel workers exposed to acrylamide and NMA during grouting work during a 2-year period, chromosome studies showed no increase in chromosome breaks or aberrations.",
            "However, this exposure was associated with an increased number of chromatid gaps.",
            "Workers lacking GSTM1 and GSTT1 had the highest number of chromatid gaps; this finding indicates that individual susceptibility related to the detoxification of acrylamide and N-methylolacrylamide may have played a role in the observed effect.",

            "Exposure to organochlorine compounds, including organochlorine pesticides, has been investigated as a potential risk factor for NHL (Palackdharry 1994).",
            "These compounds are lipophilic and have prolonged half-lives of years to decades; as a consequence, they accumulate in human adipose tissues and can cause chronic toxicity after long-term exposure, even if the exposure is at a relatively low dose (Dich et al. 1997).",
            "Many organochlorine pesticides have been found to be carcinogenic in rodent studies (McConnell 1994).",
            "In studies of NHL, the use of pesticides has been associated with increased risk of NHL in farmworkers and other occupationally exposed groups (Baris et al. 1998;Cantor et al. 1992;Morrison et al. 1994;Woods et al. 1987;Zahm 1997).",

            "Studies in which biologic exposure measurements are available have generally been small, and findings have not been consistent across populations.",

            "In this population, a significant dose-related increase in NHL risk was associated with prediagnosis serum levels of PCBs but not with levels of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(pchlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), hexachlorobenzene, or chlordane-and heptaclor-related compounds.",

            "For heptachlor epoxide, which had the highest OR (3.4) among the analytes studied, the OR increased across exposure quartiles in a dosedependent manner, and the two highest quartiles were associated with significant and increasing risk of NHL.",
            "The single pesticide models did not, however, account for the correlation between pesticide levels, which ranged from 0.22 to 0.58 in most pairs (Table 4).",
            "In two-pesticide models of residues for which sufficient numbers of subjects had reported levels, ORs for heptachlor epoxide were the most stable, followed by dieldrin.",
            "ORs for other residues were no longer significantly elevated (Table 5).",
            "Taken as a whole, these results implicate heptachlor epoxide and dieldrin as the residues with the strongest and most robust associations with risk of NHL.",
            "The organochlorines studied were commonly used in the United States in previous decades.",
            "Chlordane was used for household pest management, termite control, and agricultural treatment of food crops, and heptachlor for crops and mosquito and termite control.",
            "Chlordane was banned in the United States for most uses by 1978 but was still used Article | Organochlorines and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Environmental Health Perspectives as a structural termiticide until 1988.",
            "Similarly, the use of heptachlor for most purposes was banned in the United States in 1978, but its production continued until 1997.",
            "It was used against fire ants as recently as 2000.",
            "Heptachlor epoxide, the residue most strongly associated with risk of NHL (Tables 3 and5), is a biologic oxidation product of heptachlor (Tashiro and Matsumura 1978).",
            "However, because technical-grade heptachlor contains some chlordane and technical-grade chlordane contains heptachlor (Kutz et al. 1991), human adipose levels could occur after exposure to either chlordane, heptachlor, or both compounds.",
            "The other chlordane-related compounds studied were trans-nonachlor, the primary human metabolite of chlordane and also a component of technical-grade chlordane, heptachlor, and oxychlordane, a human metabolite of chlordane metabolic intermediates (Tashiro and Matsumura 1978).",
            "Oxychlordane was associated with NHL in single-pesticide models (Table 3), but numbers were too low to be included in two-pesticide models (Table 5).",
            "trans-Nonachlor was not significantly associated with NHL in this study, although the sample size was very low (Table 3).",
            "Elevated trans-nonachlor levels in adipose tissue have previously been linked to NHL (OR = 4.1; 95% CI, 1.1-15) when subjects with trans-nonachlor levels above the median level of the study population (0.061 ppm) were compared with those less than the median (Hardell et al. 1996a).",
            "Dieldrin, the other residue that was most strongly linked to NHL in this study, was used until the 1970s in agriculture and for soil applications such as termite control.",

            "In breast milk samples from Australian women, concentrations of dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, and oxychlordane were associated most strongly with termite control in the home (Sim et al. 1998).",
            "Our findings may implicate termite control as a risk factor in the development of NHL, although elevated adipose tissue levels of these organochlorines can arise from direct inhalation or dermal exposure (e.g., to heptachlor or chlordane residues from termite treatments) or from diet.",
            "For the organochlorines studied, both parent compounds and metabolites can be found in foods (Dougherty et al. 2000;Stehr-Green et al. 1988), especially fish (Karl et al. 1998) andmeats (DeVoto et al. 1998;Salman et al. 1990).",
            "A limitation of the present study is that occupational information was missing for most subjects; therefore, the relation of occupational exposures to NHL could not be explored (Persson et al. 1989).",
            "Previous studies have reported increased odds of NHL with exposure to organochlorine pesticides from agricultural (Cantor et al. 1992;Woods et al. 1987;Zahm et al. 1993) and home applications (Buckley et al. 2000;Meinert et al. 2000).",
            "However, in many of these studies, identifying the risk associated with individual pesticides is difficult because exposure was defined by proxy measures, such as self-reported use or occupation, and the study populations often had multiple pesticide exposures.",
            "Where biologic measures of individual pesticide exposures have been available, studies have generally been smaller than the population of the present study.",
            "In a nested case-control study (n = 74 cases) using prediagnosis serum samples, no association was reported between levels of chlordane-and heptachlor-related compounds, dieldrin, or hexachlorobenzene and NHL (Cantor et al. 2003).",
            "In the same data set, investigators reported an increased risk of NHL with highest quartile serum PCB levels (1.07-2.07 ppm), with an OR of 4.5 (95% CI, 1.7-12.0) (Rothman et al. 1997).",
            "Hardell et al. (1997) also reported a nonsignificant increase in adipose levels of PCBs and risk of NHL in 27 cases studied previously (Hardell et al. 1996b).",

            "Hardell et al. (2001) also found an apparent interaction between organochlorines and EBV: in subjects with elevated EBV EA antibody titers, higher serum PCB levels were associated with increased risk of NHL (OR = 4.0; 95% CI, 1.2-14), as were higher levels of sum of chlordanes (OR = 4.0; CI, 1.2-14) and hexachlorobenzene (OR = 5.3;95% CI,.",
            "We found no association with PCBs, although the laboratory analysis was not quantitative (Table 3) and missing values for PCBs may have introduced bias.",
            "In addition, because our controls were collected, on average, slightly earlier than were cases and because PCB levels in the U.S. population were generally decreasing during this time period (Kutz et al. 1991), our analysis could have been biased toward a null finding.",
            "Rothman et al. (1997) also reported finding no significant association between total lipid-corrected serum concentrations of DDT and risk of NHL, and this finding is supported by the present study, in which we found no clear association between exposure to DDT and NHL.",

            "Levels of heptachlor epoxide and dieldrin in adipose tissue from our control subjects were generally similar to or slightly higher than levels reported in other U.S. studies at the time [reviewed by Kutz et al. (1991)].",

            "(mean, 0.11 ppm) were similar to ours.",
            "Dieldrin levels were higher, with a mean of 0.35 ppm (Burns 1974), which might be because the authors reported samples were taken from an area with heavy agricultural use of pesticides.",
            "In a study of 70 subjects in Arizona during 1968-1969, Morgan and Roan (1970) reported mean dieldrin levels in adipose tissue of 0.14 ppm.",
            "In autopsy specimens from 146 subjects in Florida during 1965-1967, mean levels of dieldrin were 0.22 ppm (Edmundson et al. 1968).",
            "Levels in other countries such as Canada were generally lower: Canadian studies from 1969-1981 reported adipose values for dieldrin ranging from 0.043 to 0.17 ppm (Kutz et al. 1991).",
            "We can only speculate on reasons for the discrepancy between our results regarding the risks associated with heptachlor-and chlordane-related compounds and dieldrin and the results of Cantor et al. (2003).",
            "One reason could be that our reported association is real and is detected in our study because of our larger sample size (174 cases vs. 74 cases), larger geographic area, and/or our use of adipose tissue measurements instead of serum measurements.",
            "In addition, the magnitude of the organochlorine exposure could differ between subjects in the two studies.",
            "A direct comparison is difficult, however, because Cantor et al. (2003) measured serum levels (medians: heptachlor epoxide, 0.111 ppm for cases vs. 0.103 ppm for controls; dieldrin, 0.130 ppm for cases vs. 0.117 ppm for controls; neither difference was significant), whereas we report adipose tissue levels (medians: heptachlor epoxide, 0.120 ppm for cases vs.",
            "0.090 ppm for controls; dieldrin, 0.180 ppm for cases vs.",
            "0.150 ppm for controls; both residues were significantly higher in cases).",
            "Ratios of lipid-adjusted serum to adipose tissue levels can vary by organochlorine residue and among populations (Mussalo-Rauhamaa 1991;Needham et al. 1990;Patterson et al. 1988;Waliszewski et al. 2000), so a direct comparison of levels of organochlorine residues between our study and the Cantor et al. (2003) study cannot be made.",
            "Another explanation for the differing results between the two studies could be that the association between adipose tissue levels and NHL is an artifact of the samples having been collected both postdiagnosis and primarily postmortem in our study, limitations not present in the Cantor et al. (2003) study.",
            "This latter explanation would be supported if adipose tissue residue levels increased postdiagnosis or at the end stages of NHL.",
            "Our results, however, are in agreement with elevated levels of chlordane-related compounds in adipose tissue from NHL patients obtained pretreatment (Hardell et al. 1996a) and increased levels of chlordane-related compounds in serum obtained pretreatment in NHL patients with EBV EA > 80 (Hardell et al. 2001), although both studies had smaller numbers and also reported significant increases in other organochlorines in samples from NHL cases.",
            "Data on the potential for change in chlordane-related compound levels in adipose tissue postdiagnosis for NHL are lacking, although adipose tissue levels of organochlorines may be more stable than are serum levels.",
            "In a study of organochlorine pesticides before and after treatment for NHL, Baris et al. (2000) found that serum levels of PCBs and DDE decreased approximately 25% posttreatment.",
            "If adipose tissue levels did decrease in our subjects, the associations found would underestimate the true relationship.",
            "In contrast, studies of organochlorine levels after sudden weight loss in obese individuals have reported an increase in serum and adipose levels of PCBs and other organochlorines (Charlier et al. 2002;Chevrier et al. 2000).",
            "This effect was not noted for chlordane-related compounds in a longitudinal study of Swedish women, where body mass index (BMI) and a recent change in weight were not associated with a difference in serum trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane levels, although these factors were associated with a difference in most serum PCB congener levels (Glynn et al. 2003).",
            "In our study, the collection protocol explicitly called for the exclusion of cachexic patients by the collecting pathologist or physician; however, the effectiveness and balance of this procedure could not be determined.",
            "It should be noted that our case samples did not have a lower percentage of lipid than did accident controls, although both cases and accident controls had a lower percentage of lipid than did MI control subjects (see \"Materials and Methods\").",
            "However, because direct information on the percent change in body mass after diagnosis is not available for subjects in this study, and the potential for associated change in adipose organochlorine levels exists, it must be emphasized that collection postdiagnosis and primarily postmortem is an important limitation of this study.",
            "Two groups of subjects were used as controls, one with a diagnosis of accidental injury or death and the second of subjects with a diagnosis of MI.",
            "In an unconditional regression analysis comparing cases with each control group, findings were generally consistent with results from the matched analysis (data not shown).",
            "Little is known about the association of organochlorine exposure with risk of MI.",
            "However, obesity is a risk factor for MI, and obese persons and persons with higher BMI have been reported to have higher serum and adipose levels of some, but not all, organochlorines (Chevrier et al. 2000;James et al. 2002;Pelletier et al. 2002;Schade and Heinzow 1998).",
            "In addition to possibly greater obesity prevalence in MI controls than cases, adipose tissue samples from MI controls in our study had a higher percentage of lipid than did either the accident controls or the cases (see \"Materials and Methods\").",
            "If MI controls had a greater prevalence of obesity than cases and, if obesity were independently associated with higher levels of our measured organochlorines, then we may have underestimated the magnitude of the organochlorinerelated risk of NHL.",
            "Conversely, as described above, if the cases experienced diagnosis-or treatment-related weight loss and associated increases in adipose tissue organochlorine levels, then we may have overestimated the magnitude of the organochlorine-related risk of NHL.",
            "Unfortunately, a limitation of this study is that weight loss information and BMI were not available, so that the possible influence of these factors on adipose levels of organochlorines and their relationship to NHL could not be assessed.",
            "The subtypes of NHL were not known in detail for the cases in our study.",
            "It may be that the risk associated with organochlorine insecticides differs by subtype.",
            "The t(14;18) translocation is a common somatic mutation found in cancer cells from some NHL patients, and Schroeder et al. (2001) found that risk from self-reported exposure to pesticides was elevated in t(14;18)-positive NHL cases only.",
            "Hardell et al. (2001) reported that the elevated risk for NHL associated with higher levels of organochlorine pesticides in subjects with elevated EBV antibodies was highest for the lowgrade B-cell type of NHL.",
            "This type of analysis may be very useful in elucidating risks in future studies.",
            "Other data that would be helpful in future studies include information about autoimmune or immunodeficiency illness among study participants, because immunologic disorders may play a role in development of NHL (Palackdharry 1994) and some changes in immune function are potentially associated with organochlorine exposures.",
            "We chose to exclude lymphatic leukemias from NHL to ensure comparability of our findings to previous studies of organochlorines and NHL in which clinical categorization schemes for these tumors were used [SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) classification; Ries et al. 2003].",
            "More recent classifications for NHL would include lymphatic leukemias [REAL (Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms) classification; Harris et al. 2000); therefore, our results would not apply to risks of all types of NHL as currently defined.",
            "A potential limitation of this study is that the organochlorine analyses were done in different laboratories over a relatively extended period of time.",
            "However, any interlaboratory differences in chemical analyses are likely to be random with respect to case status and Article | Organochlorines and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Environmental Health Perspectives therefore unlikely to have biased our findings except to the null.",
            "Adjustment for analytical laboratory in the logistic regression models did not alter our findings.",
            "Because the controls were collected overall slightly earlier than cases, and pesticide levels were generally decreasing over time, the effect would have been to increase levels in controls and decrease levels in cases, biasing our study toward the null.",
            "Thus, it is unlikely that potential interlaboratory or temporal differences in the organochlorines analysis affected our results.",
            "Another limitation of this study is that it includes predominantly NHL cases with poor prognosis or those cases in which the patient died of their disease.",
            "Because only about onethird of NHL cases are fatal, our estimated increased risks from exposures to organochlorine compounds may not be applicable to all patients with NHL.",
            "Alternatively, exposure to chlordane or heptachlor, their metabolites, or dieldrin may play a role in worsening the prognosis of NHL patients.",
            "An analogous effect was reported in a case-control study of the association of breast cancer risk and tumor aggressiveness with plasma organochlorine concentrations (Demers et al. 2000).",
            "Demers et al. (2000) provide evidence that organochlorine pesticide exposure may increase breast cancer disease severity but does not show that exposure to organochlorines alone is related to increased risk of breast cancer.",
            "A potential role for dieldrin in worsening the survival of breast cancer patients has also been reported (Hoyer et al. 2000).",
            "Therefore, it is possible that exposure to the analytes studied either may lead the initial NHL to be a more aggressive type or may worsen the disease course and prognosis once it is initiated.",
            "Timing of exposure relative to disease is unknown for our study population, although latencies between exposure and disease onset likely varied between the children and adults included among our cases.",
            "Because residues in adipose tissue were used as the exposure marker, no dose rate information is available.",
            "This means that there is no way to determine if exposure occurred over a short time period at a high level or over a long time period at a lower level.",
            "Also, because study samples were analyzed during the 1970s and 1980s, the limits of detection for these pesticides were higher then than they are now.",
            "This means the true extent of the relationship between exposure and outcome may not be realized in this study.",
            "Strengths of this study are that patient recall of exposure is not relied on for exposure data, that cases and controls were matched on demographic variables, that the study covers a wide geographic area, and that the study size is relatively large compared with similar studies that make use of human tissue analysis for pesticide exposure data.",
            "Important limitations of this study include the lack of detailed information about the subjects such as lifestyle factors, occupation, diet, and other disease conditions; the sample collection having occurred after diagnosis and primarily postmortem, so organochlorine levels in tissue may have changed from prediagnosis levels; a lack of information on BMI, which might influence adipose tissue levels of organochlorines; and no confirmation as to the effectiveness of the procedure for the exclusion of cachexic subjects.",
            "Results from this study generally support the findings of previous research showing an association between elevated levels of organochlorine pesticides in biologic samples and NHL.",
            "Because many pesticides that have been used in the past in domestic settings may still persist in the environment, and some pesticides no longer used in the United States are still used in other countries, these organochlorine pesticides may still represent a significant health concern.",

            "In the present study we examined the relationship between prenatal PAH exposure and fetal and child growth and development in Tongliang, China, where a seasonally operated coal-fired power plant was the major pollution source.",
            "In a cohort of 150 nonsmoking women and their newborns enrolled between 4 March 2002 and 19 June 2002, BaP\u2013DNA adducts were measured in maternal and umbilical cord blood obtained at delivery.",
            "The number of gestational months occurring during the period of power plant operation provided a second, more general measure of exposure to plant emissions, in terms of duration.",
            "High PAH\u2013DNA adduct levels (above the median of detectable adduct level) were associated with decreased birth head circumference (p = 0.057) and reduced children\u2019s weight at 18 months, 24 months, and 30 months of age (p < 0.05), after controlling for potential confounders.",
            "In addition, in separate models, longer duration of prenatal exposure was associated with reduced birth length (p = 0.033) and reduced children\u2019s height at 18 (p = 0.001), 24 (p < 0.001), and 30 months of age (p < 0.001).",
            "The findings suggest that exposure to elevated levels of PAHs, with the Tongliang power plant being a significant source, is associated with reduced fetal and child growth in this population.",

            "Evidence suggests that fetuses and children are more sensitive than adults to the toxicity of many environmental air pollutants because of their higher cell proliferation rates, lower immunologic competence, and decreased ability to detoxify carcinogens and to repair DNA damage.",
            "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most harmful air pollutants and are generated by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, diesel, and gasoline.",
            "PAHs are also present in tobacco smoke and grilled or broiled foods.",
            "A number of PAHs, including benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), are known human mutagens and carcinogens.",

            "There is growing evidence that PAHs are also developmental toxicants in humans.",
            "Because PAH\u2013DNA adducts reflect individual variation in exposure, absorption, metabolic activation, and DNA repair, they provide an informative individual biologic dosimeter and risk marker.",
            "Currently, the Columbia Center for Children\u2019s Environmental Health is carrying out three parallel studies in Krakow (Poland), New York City (USA), and Tongliang (China) to examine the impact of in utero exposure to airborne PAHs and other combustion-related pollutants on the health and development of newborns.",
            "The present study in Tongliang was carried out in collaboration with the Chongqing University of Medical Sciences and the Desert Research Institute.",
            "The city of Tongliang has a population of approximately 810,000, and the birth rate is at 3\u20138/1,000.",
            "The city is situated in a small basin approximately 3 km in diameter.",
            "A coal-fired power plant located south of the town center operated during the dry season from 1 December to 31 May before 2004 to compensate for the insufficient hydraulic power during that time period.",
            "This plant was the principal source of local air pollution, because in 1995 nearly all domestic heating and cooking units were converted to natural gas, and motor vehicles are not a major source.",
            "The plant was not equipped with modern pollution reduction technology and combusted about 25,000 tons of high-sulfur coal during each annual 6-month period of operation.",
            "This report concerns a cohort of newborns whose gestational period overlapped with the months of power plant operation from 1 December 2001 to 31 May 2002.",
            "As reported previously, the air monitoring data collected as part of this study indicate that Tongliang has a higher PAH level than does Krakow or New York City.",
            "The monitoring data also suggest that marked seasonal variation in air pollution was attributable in large part to power plant emissions.",
            "For example, concentrations of PAHs and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) were highest during the winter (December\u2013February) and lowest during the summer (June\u2013August).",
            "Concentrations of ambient PAHs of relatively high molecular weight (168\u2013266) were 1.5\u20133.5 times higher during the power plant\u2019s operational period.",
            "PAHs in this molecular weight range include BaP and benzo[e]pyrene, which are known byproducts of coal combustion.",
            "The air monitoring data thus provide compelling evidence that the power plant was the major contributor to PAHs in air.",
            "We hypothesized that higher PAH biologic effective doses, as measured by higher levels of PAH\u2013DNA adducts in the umbilical cord blood, will lead to worse birth outcomes and affect the physical growth of the children.",
            "Our previous study in Krakow showed that mothers and newborns with higher exposure to ambient air pollution had increased PAH\u2013DNA adducts, and that newborns with more PAH\u2013DNA adducts had significantly decreased birth weight, birth length, and head circumference.",
            "We also hypothesized that longer durations of in utero exposure would be associated with worse outcomes.",
            "The power plant was permanently shut down in May 2004 after the Tongliang County government determined that its shutdown would significantly improve local health and have minimal adverse social and economic impacts.",
            "After the shutdown, we enrolled a second cohort of mothers and newborns to compare the health of children with and without in utero exposure to the emissions of the power plant.",
            "The data collected from that cohort will appear in future publications.",
            "Because coal-fired power plants currently produce 75% of China\u2019s electricity and most new plants are being built to burn coal, results from the Tongliang study have implications for the health of many other children in China.",

            "The women were selected using a screening questionnaire when they checked in for delivery.",
            "Eligibility criteria included current non-smoking status, \u2265 20 years of age, and residence within 2.5 km of the Tongliang power plant.",
            "We recruited every eligible woman who gave birth at one of the four hospitals between 4 March 2002 and 19 June 2002.",
            "Their demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1.",
            "All eligible women agreed to enter the study, with 10.6% (16 of 150) lost to follow-up through their children\u2019s age of 30 months.",
            "All subjects gave informed written consent by completing a form approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board and Chongqing University of Medical Sciences.",
            "Personal interview",
            "A 45-min questionnaire was administered by a trained interviewer after delivery.",
            "The questionnaire elicited demographic information, lifetime residential history (location of birth and duration of residence), history of active and passive smoking (including number of household members who smoke), occupational exposure, medication information, alcohol use during each trimester of pregnancy, and consumption of PAH-containing meat (frequency of eating fried, broiled, or barbecued meat during the last 2 weeks).",
            "Socioeconomic information related to income and education was also collected.",
            "Biologic sample collection and analysis",
            "Maternal blood (10 mL) was collected within 1 day postpartum, and umbilical cord blood (40\u201360 mL) was collected at delivery.",
            "Samples were transported to the field laboratory at the Tongliang County Hospital immediately after collection.",
            "All samples were processed there.",
            "For blood samples, the buffy coat, packed red blood cells, and plasma were separated and stored at \u221270\u00b0C.",
            "DNA adducts",
            "We analyzed BaP\u2013DNA adducts in extracted white blood cell (WBC) DNA using the modified high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013fluorescence method, which detects BaP tetrols.",
            "This assay is a sensitive and specific method for measuring BaP\u2013DNA adducts in WBCs from individuals exposed to BaP and has a 12% coefficient of variation.",
            "Among 150 blood samples, 19 of them did not have enough DNA for the assay.",
            "Of the remaining 131 samples, 104 had detectable adduct levels, and 27 had nondetectable adduct levels.",
            "We assigned a value of 0.125, which is half of the adduct detection limit of 0.25, to the nondetectable samples.",
            "Samples were run coded, and samples from mother\u2013child pairs were run in the same batch to minimize batch effects.",
            "Measures relevant to birth outcomes and physical development",
            "Birth weight, birth length, and head circumference were measured immediately after parturition.",
            "Information abstracted by the research workers from mothers\u2019 and infants\u2019 medical records after delivery included date of delivery; gestational age at birth (based on the last menstrual period); infant sex, birth weight, length, head circumference, and malformations; maternal height, prepregnancy weight, and total weight gain; complications of pregnancy and delivery; and medications used during pregnancy.",
            "After the newborns reached 18 months of age, their weight, height, and head circumference were periodically measured at 6-month intervals as indicators of physical development.",
            "Duration of exposure",
            "The estimated duration of in utero exposure to power plant operation was based on the number of months of pregnancy that overlapped with the period of plant operation (1 December 2001 to 31 May 2002).",
            "All births occurred between 4 March 2002 and 19 June 2002.",
            "Thus, the duration of prenatal exposure to power plant emissions ranged from 3.13 to 6 months for individual children.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "Measures of PAH\u2013DNA adducts and birth outcomes including birth weight, birth length, and head circumference were log-transformed to normalize the distribution and stabilize the variance.",
            "The paired Student\u2019s t-test was used to compare the maternal and cord blood adduct levels.",
            "In testing associations with health outcomes, cord blood adducts were used as the independent variable as in prior studies.",
            "We used multiple linear regression to analyze the association between PAH\u2013DNA adduct level and either birth outcomes or child development, adjusting for potential confounders.",
            "Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), sex, maternal height, and maternal weight were associated with one or more outcomes (p < 0.1) and were considered to be potential confounders of the association between PAH\u2013DNA adducts and birth outcomes and children\u2019s physical growth.",
            "Dietary PAH was not included as a covariate because it did not significantly contribute to the final models.",
            "High adducts were defined as greater than the median of the detectable adduct value, or 0.36 adducts/10\u22128 nucleotides.",
            "Outcomes analyzed in this study included birth weight, length, and head circumference, as well as child weight, length, and head circumference at 18, 24, and 30 months of age.",
            "Gestational age was found to be a significant predictor of birth outcomes and was therefore added to the models involving birth outcome analysis.",
            "In all analyses involving head circumference, maternal head circumference and cesarean status were also considered as covariates.",
            "Because analyses of physical development involved repeated measurements, we used linear mixed models with random subject effect to account for the within-subject correlation.",
            "Results",
            "The demographic characteristics of the 150 mother\u2013newborn pairs from this cohort study are shown in Table 1.",
            "The mean cord blood adduct level (0.33 \u00b1 0.14 adducts/108 nucleotides) was somewhat higher than the maternal adduct level (0.29 \u00b1 0.13 adducts/108 nucleotides).",
            "Although the difference was not significant, given the estimated 10-fold lower dose to the fetus compared with the mother, the comparable levels of adducts provide evidence that human fetuses are more susceptible than adults to the genotoxic effects of PAHs.",
            "High cord blood adduct level was significantly associated with decreased birth head circumference (p = 0.057) and reduced infant/child weight at 18 months (p = 0.03), 24 months (p = 0.027), and 30 months of age (p = 0.049) (see Table 2).",
            "However, maternal adduct level was neither significantly correlated with cord blood adduct level (r = 0.140, p = 0.299) nor significantly associated with fetal and child growth.",
            "The interaction term between sex and cord blood PAH\u2013DNA adduct level was not significant, suggesting that the strength of association between adduct level and fetal and child growth was not significantly different between females and males.",
            "Because higher power is required to detect significance in the interaction term, the lack of significance of the sex \u00d7 adduct interaction term was likely due to the lower power from the study\u2019s small sample size.",
            "However, significant associations between higher cord blood adduct level and either adverse birth outcome or worse physical development were found only among female infants.",
            "Among females, high cord blood adduct level was significantly associated with smaller birth head circumference (p = 0.022), as well as lower weight at 18 months (p = 0.014), 24 months (p = 0.012), and 30 months of age (p = 0.033) and shorter length at 18 months of age (p = 0.033).",
            "Among male infants, the corresponding associations were inverse but not significant.",
            "There was a significant association between longer duration of exposure and shorter length at birth (p = 0.032) and height at 18 months (p = 0.001), 24 months (p < 0.001), and 30 months of age (p < 0.001) (Table 3).",
            "Among females, longer duration of exposure was significantly associated with shorter length at 18 months (p = 0.024), 24 months (p = 0.018), and 30 months (p = 0.019), whereas among males, longer duration of exposure was also significantly associated with shorter length at 18 months (p = 0.019), 24 months (p = 0.003), and 30 months (p = 0.001).",
            "In the mixed model evaluating repeat measures of physical growth from birth through age 30 months, high cord blood adduct level was significantly associated with lower weight (p = 0.023) and with smaller head circumference (p = 0.056) in childhood.",
            "Duration of exposure was significantly associated with shorter length (p = 0.0001).",
            "We evaluated the association between distance from the power plant and cord adduct level as well as the association between distance and birth outcomes and physical development.",
            "Cord adduct level was negatively but not significantly correlated with distance (r = \u22120.115, p = 0.190).",
            "Longer distance from the power plant was significantly associated with greater birth length (p = 0.03), but consistently positive associations between distance and birth outcomes and physical development were not found.",
            "Therefore, our analyses indicate that distance is not a good predictor of PAH exposure.",
            "Discussion",
            "This study examined the associations between cord blood PAH\u2013DNA adducts and birth outcomes and physical growth in a Chinese population exposed to coal-burning emissions.",
            "There was a significant association between elevated cord blood adducts and reduced birth head circumference, and with reduced physical growth (decreased weight at 18, 24, and 30 months of age), after adjusting for potential confounders.",
            "These are potentially important findings because several previous studies have reported a correlation between reduced fetal growth and poorer cognitive outcomes.",
            "The findings are also consistent with prior reports that PAH\u2013DNA cord blood adducts in Caucasian, African-American, and Dominican newborns were significantly associated with reduced fetal growth, alone or in combination with ETS exposure.",
            "As noted above, distance from the power plant was not a good predictor of PAH exposure or of outcomes.",
            "The present analysis did not include dispersion modeling to take into account meteorologic factors such as wind speed and wind direction.",
            "Because of these factors, subjects who live the same distance from the power plant may receive different levels of plant emission exposure, depending on their residential coordinate relative to the plant.",
            "This may account for the observation that the distance measurement alone was not a good predictor of adduct level or birth outcomes and physical development.",
            "Future analyses will use dispersion modeling to account for the impact of meteorologic factors.",
            "Fetal toxicity from PAHs may be caused by antiestrogenic effects, binding of constituents to the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor to induce P450 enzymes, DNA damage resulting in activation of apoptotic pathways, binding to receptors for placental growth factors resulting in decreased exchange of oxygen and nutrients, or direct effects of carbon monoxide.",
            "In the multiple linear regression analysis, we found that the association between greater adduct level and decreased at-birth head circumference and physical development was significant only among females.",
            "In males, there was an inverse relationship between cord blood adduct level and birth outcome/physical development, but the associations were not significant.",
            "Although our small sample size provided insufficient power to detect significance in the interaction term, the findings suggest that female fetuses may be more susceptible to the toxicity of PAHs than male fetuses.",
            "The mechanism for a possible sex difference is not clear; however, sexual dimorphism of P450 gene expression may lead to higher susceptibility of female fetuses to the toxicity of PAHs compared with male fetuses.",
            "CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are responsible for bioactivating PAHs such that they covalently bind to DNA to form harmful PAH\u2013DNA adducts.",
            "According to, the expression of CYP1B1 is significantly higher in leukocytes of women than men, and showed that CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 levels in noninduced lymphocytes were significantly higher in female nonsmokers than in male nonsmokers.",
            "In summary, higher levels of CYP1 have been found in females in various studies, whether in the noninduced state or after induction by a chemical compound, which may result in sex differences in susceptibility to the toxic effects of PAHs and other combustion-related pollutants.",
            "Our small sample size provided insufficient power to detect significance in the interaction term for sex as an effect modifier of the association between adduct level and birth outcomes and physical development.",
            "Future studies with larger samples are needed to determine whether sex is a significant effect modifier of the association between adduct level and birth outcomes and physical development.",
            "Maternal adduct level was neither significantly correlated with cord blood adduct level nor significantly associated with fetal and child growth.",
            "This suggests that the biologic dose received by the fetus, which depends partly on its genetic profile, is more relevant than the maternal dose to fetal and child growth.",
            "Maternal adduct level may not correlate with the cord blood adduct level because of the different genetic profiles of the mother and the child.",
            "Our previous study involving Polish mothers and newborns found that CYP1A1 polymorphisms were not associated with maternal adduct level but were associated with umbilical WBC adduct level.",
            "We also found that fetal and child growth were affected differently by PAH\u2013DNA adduct level and duration of exposure.",
            "Higher adduct level was significantly associated with decreased birth head circumference and reduced weight at 18, 24, and 30 months of age, whereas longer duration of exposure was associated with reduced birth length and shorter height at 18, 24, and 30 months of age.",
            "In addition, although significant associations between adduct level and fetal and child growth were only found among females, significant associations between duration of exposure and fetal and child growth were present among both males and females.",
            "A possible explanation of why longer duration of exposure is significantly associated with worse growth outcomes in both sexes, not just among females, is that although adducts represent the amount of exposure to BaP, duration of exposure represents the amount of exposure to multiple harmful compounds released by the power plant, including other PAHs, PM, and metals.",
            "As mentioned above, we were able to attribute seasonal variation in air pollution largely to power plant emissions, which supports the assumption that a longer period of overlap between gestation and plant operation is a proxy for higher in utero exposure to ambient PAHs and PM2.5 and other coal-burning emissions.",
            "This study has the advantage of being based on individual data as well as medical record and questionnaire data.",
            "In addition, we were able to quantitatively measure the individual biologically effective dose of BaP through the measurement of BaP\u2013DNA adducts.",
            "However, the study was limited by the modest number of subjects (150) for whom data from all relevant domains were available.",
            "Because most study subjects were exposed to power plant emission in both the second and third trimesters, we could not evaluate trimester-specific effects of exposure on fetal and child growth.",
            "Another limitation was that children received postnatal exposure to power plant emission in addition to prenatal exposure.",
            "Because of the power needs of the Tongliang community, the power plant was shut down later than anticipated, and subjects continued to receive exposure to the plant emission after birth.",
            "It is therefore not possible to separate the impact of postnatal exposure from that of prenatal exposure on child physical development.",
            "Results from phase 2 of the Tongliang project, which is studying a second cohort of children who were conceived after the power plant shutdown and did not have in utero exposure to power plant emissions, will be presented in future publications.",
            "In conclusion, these results indicate that PAHs from coal-burning power plants are harmful to the developing fetus and child and have implications for energy policy and health.",
            "The Tongliang coal-burning power plant was shut down without serious economic consequences to the city, and the energy needs formerly met by the plant were subsequently provided by power from the grid.",
            "Because coal-fired power plants currently produce 75% of China\u2019s electricity and most new plants are being built to burn coal, results from the Tongliang study have implications for the health of many other children in China."

            "1) In cellular investigations, while a few studies have demonstrated adverse effects of RF exposure, 2,3) most studies have not provided consistent evidence of adverse biological effects under non-thermal RF exposure conditions. [4][5][6]",

            "However, some studies, that have attempted to validate the results of microarray experiments using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), demonstrated no such changes of gene expression. [19][20][21]",
            "Validation has not yet been performed in most studies, although the results of microarrays contain serious uncertainties and chances for false-positive findings.",

            "A culture dish of inside diameter 90 mm is placed on the short circuiting metallic plate inside the waveguide, where the conditions of atmosphere are controlled appropriately for cell culture by introducing 5% CO2 and 95% humidified air.",
            "In this experiment, we made three improvements on the apparatus previously used; i) addition of a Peltier effect device on the metallic plate to control the temperature of the culture medium, ii) increasing the length of the waveguide to improve the precision of electromagnetic distribution in the waveguide, iii) changing the structure of the end of the waveguide to allow a cell culture dish to be easily inserted and removed.",

            "The length of the waveguide was extended from 230 mm to 490 mm, which improved the purity of transmission mode of TM 01 in the waveguide to allow the better-defined electromafnetic field distribution in the medium.",

            "Overall, we concluded that very few genes were altered by RF exposure, since only 0.28% of about 10,000 genes, which were judged as \"present\", were found to be altered significantly.",

            "When we selected a cutoff value of 2-fold, which is a common cutoff value in microarray experiments, [24][25][26] only 5 genes appeared to be statistically significantly altered throughout the 9 conditions (Table 4).",
            "This represents too few genes to allow us to understand the tendencies of the RF exposure effects.",
            "Therefore, we again performed statistical analysis using a cutoff value of 1.5-fold, which is another common cutoff value in microarray experiments. 27,28)",
            "This change led to an increase in the number of genes; however, the difficulty of understanding the tendencies of the RF exposure effects remained.",
            "Increasing the SAR did not lead to any increase in altered genes, and increasing exposure duration did not lead to any increase or decrease in altered genes.",
            "The number of genes that were judged as statistically significantly altered changed depending upon the number of genes that were used for the statistical analysis.",
            "The number of genes used for the statistical analysis changed depending upon the cutoff threshold value.",
            "For these reasons, the number of the statistically significantly down-regulated genes that met the 1.5-fold cutoff might be smaller than that of the 2-fold cutoff in 1 W/kg-24 h and 10 W/kg-4 h experimental groups (Table 4).",
            "In statistical analysis of 1 W/kg-24 h, 3 genes were used for statistical analysis after filtration of the 2.0-fold cutoff although 16 genes were used after fil- tration of the 1.5-fold cutoff.",
            "Two out of 3 genes were judged as statistically significantly altered after filtration of the 2.0-fold cutoff although 0 out of 16 genes were judged as statistically significantly altered after filtration of the 1.5fold cutoff.",
            "In statistical analysis of the 10 W/kg-4 h group, 1 gene was used for statistical analysis after filtration of the 2.0-fold cutoff, whereas 83 genes were used after filtration of the 1.5-fold cutoff.",
            "This suggests that increasing the number of candidate genes by declining the cutoff threshold does not always increase the number of statistically significantly altered genes.",
            "The results of microarray studies should be validated by other methods although microarray technology is advancing.",
            "In this experiment, we tried to validate the results of microarray by RT-PCR.",
            "The results of RT-PCR showed that exposure to RF fields did not affect gene expression (Table 7).",
            "The most plausible reason for the false-positive results of microarray is thought to be the low expression level of genes that have been judged as being significantly altered by microarray.",
            "For example, in microarray analysis of exposure to RF fields at 1 W/kg of SAR for 4 h, the most intensely expressed gene was \u03b2-actin; with an average intensity from 3 independent experiments of 22,008 fluorescence unit under our scanning conditions of the microarray chips.",
            "However, the fluorescence intensity of almost all genes that were judged as being significantly altered was around 100-500 units.",
            "These intensities were less than 1/40 than that of \u03b2actin, and were almost at the lower limit of the microarray accuracy.",
            "The larger standard deviation of lower intensity signals compared with higher intensity signals has been reported previously, which further supports our suggestion. 29,30)",
            "In this experiment, we detect 23 assigned gene spots and 5 non-assigned gene spots as prospective altered gene spots by microarray analysis.",
            "However, no significant alterations in gene expression were observed in 22 genes out of the 23 assigned genes analyzed by RT-PCR.",
            "Compared with microarray, RT-PCR is more accurate for investigating the levels gene expression.",
            "Therefore, our results suggested that there were no effects of exposure to RF fields on gene expression.",
            "Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that there were no detectable biological effects of exposure to non-thermal RF fields. [19][20][21]",
            "In contrast, our results are not consistent with previous studies showing the biological effects of exposure to RF fields. 17,18)",
            "This inconsistency thought to be due to non-validation of experiments 17) or different species, different exposure systems, different cell homogeneity compared with our experiments.",
            "18) In conclusion, we found no evidence to suggest that exposure to RF fields affected gene expression in SVGp12 cells under the current experimental conditions.",

            "It was found that the excretion of 1-pyrenol for the same persons varied from 0.3 to 1.5 mol per 24 h (17), while the estimated inhaled doses of vapors and particulate pyrene together amounted to only 0.03-0.09 mollworkshift.",
            "Hence the significance of skin absorption is much more important for pyrene than for naphthalene.",
            "Naphthalene enters the body by inhalation, and it may also be taken up through the skin.",
            "Our observations indicate that occupational exposure to naphthalene can be assessed by measuring the 1-naphthol concentration in the urine at the end of the workshift.",
            "Naphthalene is the main component in creosote vapors; it constitutes 40-60% of the mass of the vapor phase in impregnation plants and 29-35% of the airborne substance when newly impregnated wood is being handled (6).",
            "By contrast, the air concentrations of 4-6 ring PAH have been 100-200 times lower than that of naphthalene because of low volatility; during exposure these substances are mainly taken up through the skin.",
            "Therefore, urinary I -naphthol alone is not a suitable marker substance either for the assessment of total PAH exposure or for the assessment of exposure to hydrocarbons with 5 or 6 fused aromatic rings, which are the major health concerns in relation to creosote because of carcinogenic properties.",
            "a The inhalation uptake of naphthalenelworkshift was calculated by estimating 25 llmin for lung ventilation and 50% retention.",
            "Overtime working from 1400 to 1800.",
            "One voidance lost or partial, not included in mean values.",
            "a The inhalation uptake of naphthalenelworkshift was calculated by estimating 25 llmin for lung ventilation and 50% retention.",

            "Medians of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) were 2.35/106 dGuo in DNA of WBC and 4.33\u00a0\u00b5g/g creatinine in urine.",

            "In summary, oxidatively damaged urinary guanosine was associated with airborne and systemic exposure to metals in welders and showed a strong relation to body iron stores.",
            "Electronic supplementary material",
            "The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00204-014-1319-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
            "Introduction",
            "Welding is a commonly applied process to join metal parts, usually of mild or stainless steel.",
            "A large workforce is exposed to welding fumes, which mainly contain iron (Fe), but also manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni) (Pesch et al.; Weiss et al.).",
            "In 1990, welding fumes were classified as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic\u201d to humans (Group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans).",
            "Epidemiological evidence from pooled and meta-analyses has been accumulating that welders may show an excess lung cancer risk (Ambroise et al.; Kendzia et al.).",
            "An IARC expert group has recommended an update of the evaluation of the carcinogenicity of welding (Ward et al.).",
            "Fe and Mn are major constituents of welding fumes and tightly correlated with the overall particle concentration (Pesch et al.).",
            "Cr and Ni are important additives to improve the quality of stainless steel; their concentrations in welding fumes are strongly correlated (Weiss et al.).",
            "Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and Ni are classified as human carcinogens (IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans).",
            "However, the observed excess lung cancer risk in welders could not be fully explained by welding of stainless steel and, hence, exposure to Cr(VI) or Ni only (Ambroise et al.; Kendzia et al.).",
            "The inflammatory response to particulate matter in welding fumes may induce oxidative stress in the lung (Valavanidis et al.).",
            "Besides the particle effect of welding fumes, the comprising metals, as for example Fe and Cr, may catalyze redox reactions, which can further increase the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [reviewed in (Jomova and Valko)].",
            "Iron is the most abundant metal in the body, involved, for example, in oxygen transport and storage.",
            "Nevertheless, it is tightly regulated to avoid oxidative damage, with ferritin serving as iron storage protein (Wang et al.).",
            "Serum ferritin (SF) is a recognized biomarker of body iron stores and has also been proposed to be linked to inflammation and cancer (Torti and Torti).",
            "In a previous analysis, we found a weak association of SF with airborne Fe in welders (Pesch et al.).",
            "Also, other metals present in welding fumes such as Ni, Cr, and Mn may be toxic and compromise genomic stability under overload conditions, partly due to the inactivation of defense systems against ROS and inhibition of DNA repair systems (Beyersmann and Hartwig; Salnikow and Zhitkovich).",
            "Thus, metals can increase the extent of ROS either directly or indirectly, which can cause oxidative damage to DNA and other biomolecules.",
            "An oxidation product of guanosine, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo), is the most abundant and prominent DNA lesion.",
            "Oxidatively modified guanosine in the lung as target organ can be investigated in vivo in experimental animals, but not in healthy humans.",
            "Only noninvasive methods can be applied to collect body fluids as proxy tissue, for example, blood or urine (Valavanidis et al.).",
            "The investigation of welders at their workplace requires highly robust methods to avoid accidental oxidative damage, particularly during the sampling, transport, storage, and processing of biological samples.",
            "Whereas 8-oxodGuo in white blood cells (WBC) is a critical biomarker due to stability and methodological challenges (Collins et al.), urinary oxidatively damaged guanosines are rather stable and can be determined with robust and sensitive analytical methods (Marie-Desvergne et al.; Ravanat).",
            "The determination of 8-oxodGuo in WBC requires DNA isolation and is expressed as the fraction of oxidatively modified guanosine among all guanosines of the DNA strands.",
            "The determination of 8-oxodGuo in urine does not require a laborious DNA isolation and is expressed as mass concentration of oxidatively damaged nucleosides per L urine (Hu et al.).",
            "Various sources of urinary 8-oxodGuo are possible, including mtDNA and free nucleoside pools in cells (Cooke et al.).",
            "In addition to the assessment of oxidative damage to deoxyguanosines, also oxidatively modified guanosines from RNA turnover and metabolism can be determined in urine as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-oxyguanosine (8-oxoGuo).",
            "A quantitative exposure assessment has been addressed as pivotal in occupational epidemiology (Ward et al.).",
            "Although millions of workers worldwide are exposed to welding fumes, only few and rather small studies measured respirable particles in the breathing zone of welders and explored their association with oxidatively damaged molecules together with pertinent covariates (Antonini; Halasova et al.).",
            "Here, we applied statistical modeling to estimate the impact of airborne and systemic exposure to metals on the occurrence of oxidatively modified guanosine in urine and blood samples from welders.",
            "Materials and methods",
            "Study population",
            "The design of the WELDOX study has been previously described (Lehnert et al.; Pesch et al.; Weiss et al.).",
            "Here, we analyzed 238 male welders of the WELDOX study recruited from 23 locations in Germany between 2007 and 2009.",
            "One welder with hematuria, one welder who donated blood within the last 2\u00a0days, and three welders with potentially interfering diseases were excluded from the original study population of 243 workers.",
            "For 21 other welders, no analyses of DNA adducts in WBC were available.",
            "In short, usually twelve welders were recruited from each plant.",
            "During one working shift, four welders were equipped with personal air samplers on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.",
            "Blood and urine were collected after shift, and information about the workplaces, smoking habits, and the medical history were documented in a questionnaire.",
            "All welders gave their written informed consent prior to examination.",
            "The study was conducted in accordance with the principles for medical research involving human subjects as defined by the Declaration of Helsinki.",
            "The local Ethics Committee of the Ruhr University Bochum approved the study protocol used in this study (Reg. No. 2732).",
            "Welding techniques and workplaces",
            "Details about the welding process were documented according to a standardized format for monitoring German workplaces (Gabriel et al.).",
            "The welding techniques at the day of examination included gas metal arc welding with solid wire (GMAW) (N\u00a0=\u00a096), flux-cored arc welding with shielding gas (FCAW) (N\u00a0=\u00a045), tungsten inert gas welding (TIG) (N\u00a0=\u00a065), and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) (N\u00a0=\u00a019).",
            "Another 13 welders performed multiple techniques on the day of investigation.",
            "The physical workload of the welders was rated by the field-work team (Lehnert et al.).",
            "Forty-seven welders had a high physical workload on the day of examination.",
            "Twenty-seven welders used a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), particularly when welding stainless steel with high-emission techniques.",
            "Although GMAW and FCAW were usually applied to mild steel, in one company, all welders used these techniques to weld stainless steel (Lehnert et al.), subsequently referred to as \u201chigh-exposure group\u201d.",
            "Sampling of respirable welding fumes and metal analysis",
            "Welders were equipped with two personal samplers for collecting inhalable and respirable particles in the breathing zone inside of helmets as previously described (Lehnert et al.).",
            "Here, we refer to the respirable particle fraction collected with a PGP-EA sampler at a flow rate of 3.5\u00a0L/min on cellulose nitrate filters (0.8\u00a0\u00b5m pore size, 37\u00a0mm diameter).",
            "The average duration of measurements was 3.5\u00a0h.",
            "The filters were shipped to the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance (IFA) for gravimetric determination of particulate matter and metal analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with a Perkin Elmer Elan DRC II (Waltham, Massachusetts) (Hebisch et al.; Pesch et al.; Weiss et al.).",
            "The filters were digested with 10\u00a0mL of a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid.",
            "This solution was heated for 2\u00a0h under reflux.",
            "The mass spectrometer was calibrated with multielement standard solutions.",
            "Data from two samples were missing.",
            "The following numbers of measurements were below the limit of quantitation (LOQ): 88 (welding fume), 5 (Mn), 23 (Fe), 55 (Cr), and 76 (Ni).",
            "The mass of particulate matter collected on filters, and hence, the LOQs depend on airborne concentration in combination with sampling duration (Lehnert et al.).",
            "Determination of metals in body fluids",
            "Fe, Mn, Cr, and Ni were determined in blood and urine as described previously (Pesch et al.; Weiss et al.).",
            "The samples were shipped to the Institute for Prevention and Occupational Medicine of the German Social Accident Insurance (IPA) at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C overnight.",

            "Interferences due to matrix effects were largely eliminated by means of ashing in the presence of oxygen, the Zeeman background compensation, and the standard addition procedure.",
            "Commercially available quality control material (RECIPE, Munich, Germany) was used to check the reliability of the analytical results.",
            "The LOQ was 1.0\u00a0\u00b5g/L for urinary Cr (CrU), 1.5\u00a0\u00b5g/L for urinary Ni (NiU), and 1.0\u00a0\u00b5g/L for Mn (MnB) and Fe (FeB) in blood.",
            "Within-series imprecision was better than 6.5\u00a0%, and between-days imprecision better than 10.5\u00a0%, respectively.",

            "Particulate matter, Fe, Cr, and other metals in inhaled welding fumes may induce the formation of ROS and thus oxidize nucleobases such as guanine of RNA and DNA or from the intracellular nucleotide pool.",
            "In the WELDOX study, we determined oxidatively damaged guanosines as 8-oxodGuo in relation to the number of unmodified guanosines in isolated nuclear DNA from WBC and in urine as the mass concentration per mL urine as 8-oxodGuo and 8-oxoGuo from various sources of DNA and RNA metabolism.",
            "We applied statistical modeling to determine airborne and internal exposure to metals in welding fumes as potential predictors of the levels of oxidatively damaged guanosines together with pertinent covariates in 238 welders.",
            "We observed a highly significant association of urinary 8-oxodGuo and 8-oxoGuo with SF in welders.",
            "The correlation of body iron stores with urinary 8-oxodGuo in welders is in line with a report on a strong and robust association in the general population (Hori et al.).",
            "Furthermore, we detected weak and nonlinear associations of respirable Cr with all measures of oxidatively modified guanosine as biomarkers of oxidative stress and of all systemic metal concentrations with urinary 8-oxoGuo.",
            "Welding fumes are complex mixtures, which contain particulate matter with Fe and Mn as the most abundant metals when joining parts of steel.",
            "Welding of mild steel is commonly associated with high concentrations of particles, Fe and Mn (Lehnert et al.; Pesch et al.; Weiss et al.).",
            "By contrast, welding of stainless steel is related to lower concentrations of particles, Fe and Mn. Cr and Ni are additionally emitted from consumable electrodes if they contain these metals, and when welding stainless steel.",
            "The tight statistical correlations between airborne Fe and Mn (Pesch et al.) on the one hand and between Cr and Ni (Weiss et al.) on the other hand do not allow a \u201ccausal\u201d attribution of genotoxic effects to a certain airborne metal selected for statistical modeling.",
            "The strong relations between certain welding fume constituents do not hold for measures of internal exposure to these metals.",
            "Overall, we found no linear association between SF and MnB and only a weak correlation between CrU and NiU (Pesch et al.; Weiss et al.), which may be due to a tightly controlled homeostasis of essential trace elements.",
            "In addition, more subtile and complex associations may occur, such as the competition for transporter systems as has been shown in case of Fe and Mn (Gunshin et al.).",
            "We did not find an indication of an association of airborne Ni with oxidative damage but a weak association with urinary Ni, which may reflect residual correlation with CrU. Nickel has a lower capacity of ROS induction than Cr(VI), but may deplete antioxidants and induce hypoxia [for review (Cameron et al.)].",
            "Notably, oxidatively modified nucleobases do not represent the full spectrum of possible genotoxic effects of welding fume.",
            "Strengths of our cross-sectional study are the comprehensive data collected in a large group of welders, personal measurements of respirable welding fume in the breathing zone together with measures of systemic exposure, and statistical modeling to estimate exposure effects adjusted for potential confounders.",
            "We observed slightly higher urinary 8-oxoGuo concentrations in welders exposed to respirable Fe above about 1\u00a0mg/m3 in addition to a highly significant association of body iron stores with urinary concentrations of both 8-oxoGuo and 8-oxodGuo.",
            "SF as a recognized biomarker of body iron stores was associated with airborne iron in a nonlinear manner, indicating homeostasis until a certain level of inhalative iron exposure (Pesch et al.).",
            "These observations are suggestive for a role of iron overload in oxidatively derived damage to guanosine from DNA and RNA metabolism in a subgroup of welders exposed to high iron concentrations.",
            "So far, prospective lung cancer studies in welders with biomarkers of iron metabolism and oxidative stress are still lacking to assess their cancer-predictive value (Fonseca-Nunes et al.).",
            "The highly significant association between SF and urinary concentrations of oxidatively modified guanosine cannot fully be disentangled regarding the role of particles and iron in welding fumes.",
            "SF is also a biomarker for inflammation [for review (Wang et al.)] and may include an inflammatory response to particle exposure in welders.",
            "Evidence for a role of iron in carcinogenesis is mounting, and cancer has been considered a ferrotoxic disease (Toyokuni).",
            "Iron is an essential nutrient but also a redox-active metal where a disturbed homeostasis has been associated with oxidatively derived damage, inflammation, and cancer (Torti and Torti).",
            "Even though epithelial cells in lungs are equipped with ferritin (Ghio et al.), very high airborne exposure to respirable Fe may overload the tightly regulated iron homeostasis (Pesch et al.).",
            "A detailed exploration of the iron status of welders is beyond the scope of this article but subject of another analysis.",
            "Epidemiological studies did not reveal a clear difference in lung cancer risk of welders using stainless compared to mild steel, and hence, exposure to Cr(VI) or Ni does not sufficiently explain the observed excess risks (Ambroise et al.; Kendzia et al.).",
            "In this cross-sectional study among welders, the effect of respirable and urinary Cr on oxidatively damaged guanosine in urine and WBC was rather weak.",
            "Airborne Cr is mainly trivalent in most welding settings and cannot easily enter (blood) cells.",
            "A major limitation was that we could not determine hexavalent Cr, because the welders were already equipped with two devices for sampling inhalable and respirable particles in parallel (Lehnert et al.).",
            "The analytical determination of Cr(VI) is challenging, especially in welding fumes due to other interfering metal oxides (Unceta et al.).",
            "Inhaled Cr(VI) may be further reduced in the breathing zone (De Flora) and respiratory tract (Izzotti et al.).",
            "We used the detection of Cr in erythrocytes to assess exposure to Cr(VI), which can enter cells through anion channels [for review (Nickens et al.)].",
            "However, Cr could only be detected in erythrocytes of 6\u00a0% of all welders.",
            "This group comprised several welders applying SMAW, which are known to be potentially exposed to Cr(VI) (Emmerling et al.).",
            "Only in the \u201chigh-exposure group\u201d, the majority of welders had detectable Cr in erythrocytes.",
            "They applied GMAW or FCAW to stainless steel mostly in confined space (Lehnert et al.).",
            "Their concentrations of oxidatively damaged guanosine were higher than in TIG welders or when wearing a PAPR for respiratory protection.",
            "In this particular high-exposure setting, also urinary creatinine was higher than in TIG welders, indicating heavy physical work.",
            "The \u201coxidative status\u201d of a welder is an individual balance between the generation of ROS by normal cellular metabolism, exposure to welding fume and lifestyle factors, and the capacity of antioxidant and defense mechanisms.",
            "A general advantage of the determination of oxidatively modified guanosines in urine is that the methods are considered less susceptible to artifactual oxidation than the determination of DNA adducts in WBC (Cooke et al.; Il\u2019yasova et al.).",
            "Furthermore, (tandem) mass-spectrometric methods with quantification via isotope dilution are both highly selective and sensitive (Barregard et al.).",
            "However, a large fraction of the variance of oxidative damage remained unexplained in all models.",
            "So far, less is known about the sources of urinary 8-oxoGuo (Cooke et al.).",
            "This raises the questions whether the excretion of degradation products into urine may also reflect at least partially clearance mechanisms in addition to exposure.",
            "A controversial issue in human biomonitoring is creatinine adjustment (Pesch et al.; Aylward et al.), which is a classical approach to correct for urine dilution.",
            "However, urinary creatinine may depend upon physical activity, but also on age, sweating, drinking habits, and other factors (Umweltbundesamt).",
            "Welders with a high physical workload excreted higher concentrations of creatinine and had considerably higher adduct concentrations than welders with a low physical workload.",
            "This raises the question whether physical activity may contribute to both, elevated concentrations of urinary creatinine and oxidatively modified guanosine.",
            "The higher concentrations of oxidatively damaged guanosine in welders with Cr in erythrocytes compared to welders without Cr in erythrocytes diminished to some degree when urinary adducts were adjusted for creatinine in a simple manner as ratio of both concentrations.",
            "Our multivariate models included in addition to creatinine also age and smoking in combination with measures of exposures, because the excretion of 8-oxodGuo into urine was slightly higher in active smokers and 8-oxoGuo increased by age.",
            "When adjusting for these covariates, the estimate\u2019s effects are supportive for an influence of welding fume on urinary 8-oxoGuo and 8-oxodGuo.",
            "This influence is further supported by the strong association of SF with oxidatively modified guanosine in urine, although an attribution of the effects to particulate matter and the various metals in welding fumes remains to be elucidated.",
            "We further assessed whether high levels of oxidative damage may have been caused by factors not captured in the model.",
            "The highest DNA adduct rate in WBC was observed in a welder who donated blood 2\u00a0days prior to examination.",
            "Subjects with blood donation prior to blood drawing were excluded from this analysis.",
            "Slightly elevated adduct rates in WBC were determined in few welders using acetylsalicylic acid as medication.",
            "The latter observation is in line with in vitro studies where acetylsalicylic acid induced apoptosis by increasing the production of ROS (Farrugia et al.; Raza et al.).",
            "A lack of a clear association of exposure with 8-oxodGuo in WBC has been observed in this and former studies (Pesch et al.).",
            "Excellent reviews claim problems with artifactual oxidation and large differences between methods when determining 8-oxoGuo in WBC (Collins et al.; Valavanidis et al.).",
            "Besides analytical challenges when analyzing 8-oxodGuo in DNA isolated from WBC, it has to be taken into account that WBC comprise a mixture of different cell types, with different life-spans, which employ different strategies for the uptake, storage, and release of iron [for review (Weiss)].",
            "For example, lymphocytes have a low ferritin content and seem to support the body\u2019s retention of iron for pathogens (Wang et al.).",
            "By contrast, macrophages and monocytes capture particulate matter, recycle iron from senescent erythrocytes, and have a high ferritin content.",
            "This complexity may require a separate analysis of the different WBC cell populations in terms of measuring oxidative damage.",
            "In conclusion, high exposure to respirable iron and the concentrations of SF as biomarker of body iron stores were associated with the excretion of 8-oxodGuo und 8-oxoGuo into the urine of welders.",
            "We further found higher levels of 8-oxoGuo in welders with detectable concentrations of Cr in welding fumes as well as in erythrocytes.",
            "Welders are exposed to a complex mixture of particles and redox-active metals where efficient ventilation and respiratory protection should be provided as preventive measure to reduce the exposure and oxidative stress."

            "The VET ranged from 12 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b5m in controls to 114 \u00b1 8 \u00b5m in treated animals, and was correlated to blood levels of either treatment compound.",
            "The UEH ranged from an average of 7.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m in controls to 26 \u00b1 2 \u00b5m in high-dose o,p\u00b4-DDT-treated animals.",

            "Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is infamous as an endocrine disruptor in birds (2), and the o,p\u00b4-isomer of DDT, which constitutes approximately 15% of the technical mixture, is estrogenic in vitro and in vivo (3).",
            "Another estrogenic pesticide residue is the \u03b2isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), which constitutes 7-12% of technical HCH (4).",
            "\u03b2-HCH has several toxicologic effects in addition to estrogenic activity; also, it preferentially accumulates in the fat of biota and biomagnifies as it moves through the food web (4).",

            "The debate is likely to continue because there are no \"unexposed\" cohorts for comparison, and exposure information is difficult to obtain.",
            "For these reasons, we must rely on experimental animal studies as a guide to determine rational safety levels for humans.",
            "Many studies, both in vivo and in vitro, probe a variety of effects caused by these OC pesticides.",
            "Although \u03b2-HCH does not competitively bind to the estrogen receptor (17,18), it does produce a number of estrogen-like responses: it stimulates proliferation and increases synthesis of progesterone receptors in cultures of human breast cancer cells (17,18), and it produces moderate uterotrophic effects in the rodent uterus (18,19).",
            "In contrast, o,p\u00b4-DDT does competitively bind to the estrogen receptor (18,20,21), and it produces a range of estrogenic responses (18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23).",
            "However, previous in vivo studies have used only a few or very high doses of these chemicals, and only the doses applied, not the resulting blood concentrations, were reported.",

            "To simulate the effect of chronic low-level exposure seen in humans, a low dose, continuous release system of Silastic capsules was employed.",

            "In both the uterus and vagina, o,p\u00b4-DDT is more potent than \u03b2-HCH, producing a significant effect at 18 ng/mL compared to 42 ng/mL required for a significant effect by \u03b2-HCH.",
            "The observation that the uterine response to \u03b2-HCH reached a plateau at higher doses suggests that \u03b2-HCH is a compound with differential effects of the vagina and uterus.",

            "Argentinean pesticide workers had blood \u03b2-HCH concentrations as high as 240 ng/mL (29); this is nearly six times the minimal estrogenic level of 42 ng/mL found in this study.",
            "Although it is difficult to determine if the response in humans is the same as in mice, it is alarming that the human blood concentrations are so similar to the estrogenic concentrations in mice.",
            "The mouse has proven to be a good model for approximating estrogenicity of a compound in humans.",
            "For example, although the antiestrogens tamoxifen and clomiphene show little estrogenicity in the standard uterine weight and vaginal cornification bioassays performed in the rat, they are fully estrogenic in the mouse (30)(31)(32)(33), and these compounds behave as estrogen agonists in the human uterus and vagina (34)(35)(36).",
            "Also, the mouse model of developmental effects of estrogens in the female and male reproductive tracts accurately reflects the effects that diethylstilbestrol had on developing human reproductive   1).",

            "On the other hand, the choice of the outbred CD-1 mouse may not have been optimum for determination of estrogen sensitivity; Spearow et al. (41) found that other strains are much more sensitive to the effects of estradiol in the developing testes.",

            "Which strain of mouse is most appropriate for comparison to the human situation is not known, but certainly the results of the present study indicate that blood levels of o,p\u00b4-DDT or \u03b2-HCH in the nanograms per milliliter range have the potential of producing estrogenic effects.",
            "This study was designed to produce blood and tissue levels of o,p\u00b4-DDT or \u03b2-HCH in mice comparable to those found in people from the general population, that is, those who are not exposed through a job-related or accidental event.",

            "As is generally seen in human studies, (25,26), the concentration of OC pesticides is much higher in fat stores.",
            "Fat concentration is in equilibrium with blood concentration; thus, during periods of decreasing weight and fat stores, the compounds in fat are released into the blood stream and surrounding tissues (43,44).",

            "We report the presence of HPV DNA sequences in areolar tissue and tumour tissue samples from female patients with breast carcinoma.",
            "The presence of virus in the areolar\u2013nipple complex suggests to us a potential pathogenic mechanism.",
            "Methods",
            "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was undertaken to amplify HPV types in areolar and tumour tissue from breast cancer cases.",
            "In situ hybridisation supported the PCR findings and localised the virus in nipple, areolar and tumour tissue.",
            "Results",
            "Papillomavirus DNA was present in 25 of 29 samples of breast carcinoma and in 20 of 29 samples from the corresponding mamilla.",
            "The most prevalent type in both carcinomas and nipples was HPV 11, followed by HPV 6.",
            "Other types detected were HPV 16, 23, 27 and 57 (nipples and carcinomas), HPV 20, 21, 32, 37, 38, 66 and GA3-1 (nipples only) and HPV 3, 15, 24, 87 and DL473 (carcinomas only).",
            "Multiple types were demonstrated in seven carcinomas and ten nipple samples.",
            "Conclusions",
            "The data demonstrate the occurrence of HPV in nipple and areolar tissues in patients with breast carcinoma.",
            "The authors postulate a retrograde ductular pattern of viral spread that may have pathogenic significance.",
            "Introduction",
            "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in the USA, and the incidence of breast carcinoma has increased by more than 40% over 25 years.",
            "The aetiology of breast cancer remains unknown.",
            "Many risk factors have been associated with the pathogenesis of this disease, including family history, hormones, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption.",
            "Hormones, cigarette smoking and family history have also been demonstrated to enhance infections with papillomaviruses, mainly the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types involved in the aetiology of cervical carcinoma.",
            "Viral infection as an aetiological factor has been addressed in other studies.",
            "The data obtained from studies investigating the presence of viral sequences in breast cancer biopsies and cell lines have been controversial.",
            "A role for herpes viruses, and specifically Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), in the aetiology of this cancer has been questioned.",
            "A human equivalent of the murine mammary tumour virus (MMTV) has been described in breast tumours, as well as in breast cancer cell lines.",
            "These results have been questioned and negated by others (R Schmidt and H zur Hausen, unpublished results).",
            "Immortalisation of normal breast epithelial cells by the HPV types HPV 16 and HPV 18 has been used to study the functions of the viral early genes E6 and E7 in different cellular pathways.",
            "However, the presence of HPV in malignant tumours of the breast has been controversial.",
            "Several studies reported positive results, whereas others reported negative results.",
            "In the present study we report the presence of HPV DNA in biopsy samples from mammary carcinomas, as well as these viral sequences in the tissue of the corresponding mamilla.",
            "Materials and methods",
            "Samples and DNA extraction",
            "Samples from breast tumour tissue for the HPV analysis were supplied by two of the authors (RES and CEB).",
            "The 29 cases used for the retrospective study and demonstration of papillomavirus sequences were selected from routine mastectomy specimens undertaken in a course of treatment for carcinoma of the breast.",
            "Case selection was based on the availability of adequate nipple and tumour tissue from the same patient and the presence of histological features suggestive of HPV infection in nipple and areolar sections.",
            "The patients, all female, ranged in age from 30 to 88 years, with an average age of 61.3 years.",
            "Twelve tumours arose in the right breast and 17 in the left.",
            "Five tumours were subareolar and 24 were located at a distance from the nipple and areola.",
            "Tumours ranged in size from 6 mm to 15 cm.",
            "One patient received cytoxan chemotherapy before surgery.",
            "In all other cases primary treatment was surgical as represented by the specimen.",
            "One patient had undergone contralateral mastectomy ten years earlier for a localised breast cancer, which was judged clinically and pathologically to represent a separate primary tumour.",
            "Among the 29 patients there were three with remote histories of malignancy without evidence of recurrence (one cutaneous malignant melanoma, one renal cell carcinoma and one soft-tissue malignancy).",
            "One patient had undergone hysterectomy for high-grade cervical dysplasia.",
            "There were no patients with documented cervical carcinoma.",
            "No patients were immune-impaired or immunosuppressed.",
            "Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from both the nipple (n = 29) and the carcinoma of the breast (n = 29) from the same patient were sectioned, and the total DNA was extracted from each sample.",
            "Great care was taken during sectioning to avoid any contamination between samples.",
            "Two different individuals sectioned the blocks in several small random groups at different time intervals over a period of one week.",
            "The microtome was cleaned thoroughly and exposed to ultraviolet between samples; in addition, new blades were used for each sample.",
            "Deparaffinisation was performed by rotation overnight in 1 ml of xylene, followed by centrifugation and subsequent removal of the supernatant.",
            "This step was repeated twice (each for one hour) with fresh xylene.",
            "The xylene was in turn removed by rotation in 1 ml of 100% ethanol for one hour followed by centrifugation and subsequent replacement of the supernatant with 90% ethanol for 45 min, and repeated by steps of 80% ethanol for 45 min and 70% ethanol for 45 min.",
            "Samples were freeze-dried, and total cellular DNA was extracted as described previously.",
            "The DNA was digested with Proteinase K and subjected to extraction with phenol followed by extraction with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol.",
            "The extracted DNA was precipitated with ethanol and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0.",
            "PCR analysis and cloning",
            "DNA (50\u2013100 \u03bcg) of each sample was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",
            "The quality of the DNA obtained from the fixed samples was controlled by amplification with primers to detect the \u03b2-actin gene.",
            "The primers RS42 and KM29 were initially used to amplify the 536-base-pair fragment of the \u03b2-actin gene.",

            "Discussion",
            "The ubiquitous distribution of papillomavirus infections of the skin and genital and oral mucosa has been documented.",
            "Infection with specific papillomavirus types has been shown to be a necessary but not sufficient cause in the pathogenesis of malignant genital tumours.",
            "The malignant tumours generally develop after long latency periods during which additional cellular modifications occur within the infected cell.",
            "The E6 and E7 genes of the most prevalent high-risk HPV types, HPV 16 and HPV 18, modulate cellular pathways, thereby regulating proliferation and cell survival.",
            "In contrast, the E6 and E7 proteins of the low-risk types, HPV 6 and HPV 11, do not influence these cellular pathways in the same manner, although they have occasionally been demonstrated in premalignant and malignant tumours.",
            "Additional cofactors are probably needed to modulate cellular proteins so as to immortalise and transform the infected cells.",
            "The mechanism through which other HPV types, mainly associated with cutaneous lesions, might be involved in the pathogenesis of tumours has received little attention.",
            "However, preliminary data indicate that several molecular pathways are probably followed, depending on the HPV type involved.",
            "The detection of papillomavirus infections in tissues largely depends on the method used.",
            "Described methods vary greatly in their sensitivity and specificity.",
            "The HPV types HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 52 and 58 are frequently associated with genital lesions and are therefore most often targeted for HPV detection.",
            "Tests to demonstrate any of the 96 characterised HPV types in tissues require extensive analyses, including the sequencing of cloned amplimers.",
            "Most published studies therefore used methods restricted to the detection of specific, single, or combinations or groups of HPV types.",
            "The use of type-specific primers may increase the number of positive samples but is biased with regard to the HPV types involved, because other HPV types present cannot be detected.",
            "The present study investigated breast samples by using DNA PCR amplification of two conserved regions within the L1 open reading frame of the papillomavirus genome.",
            "Two of the primer combinations used (CP and GP primers) amplify an overlapping region within the L1 open reading frame.",
            "By using all three primer combinations to amplify the DNA of a single sample we are able to detect all known HPV types and also putative new HPV types.",
            "In addition, the cloning of the amplified product, in combination with sequencing of the cloned inserts, allows us to distinguish individual HPV types present in one sample, including multiple infections in one sample.",
            "Studies applying the techniques described here have demonstrated a larger spectrum of papillomavirus types associated with different types of benign and malignant tumours and argue that the historical grouping into 'mucosal' and 'cutaneous' HPV types can no longer be upheld.",
            "We are not aware of any study outside our group that has analysed tissues for the presence of infection by any HPV types as extensively as the study described here.",
            "Other investigators have analysed nipple and areolar specimens for the presence of HPV DNA.",
            "HPV 6/11 was detected in one of 20 papillomas of the nipple, whereas ten nipple duct adenomas were negative and seven low-risk and high-risk HPV types were not present in 20 cases of Paget's disease of the nipple.",
            "Single cases of papillomas of the nipple resembling condylomata acuminata harboured HPV 6 DNA and HPV 41 DNA.",
            "Reports on the detection of HPV 16, HPV 18 and/or HPV 33 DNA in breast carcinoma samples range between 11% and 68% positivity.",
            "The present study detected HPV 16 DNA in 7% of the carcinoma and in 10% of the nipple samples.",
            "The only other high-risk HPV type, HPV 66, was present in two samples from the nipple.",
            "The reasons for the differences in published reports are unclear, but may be attributed to numbers of samples tested, methodological differences or the demographics of the samples tested.",
            "In contrast, several other studies failed to demonstrate HPV sequences in tumours of the breast: all of 15 papillomas and 28 breast carcinoma samples were negative for HPV 6, 16 and 18 DNA, no HPV 16 and HPV 18 DNA could be detected in 26 fine needle aspirates and four breast carcinoma biopsies, and no HPV DNA was found in 80 samples of breast carcinomas.",
            "HPV 16 and HPV 18 oncogenes immortalise normal human mammary cells under in vitro conditions.",
            "It is unclear whether these data truly represent the in vivo situation.",
            "The present study detected papillomavirus sequences in 86% (25/29) of the breast carcinoma samples and 69% (20 of 29) of the nipple samples.",
            "HPV 6 and HPV 11 infections were most prevalent in our collection of samples.",
            "Either of the two HPV types was present in 20 of 29 (69%) of the breast carcinoma biopsies and in 12 of 29 (41%) of the samples of the mamilla.",
            "We detected the simultaneous presence of more than one HPV type in about one-third of the samples.",
            "HPV types associated with mucosal lesions, and also several associated with skin lesions, were detected.",
            "HPV 27 and HPV 57 are closely related HPV types.",
            "HPV 27 is very frequently found in cutaneous warts, whereas HPV 57 has been demonstrated in mucosal and cutaneous lesions.",
            "Several other HPV types found in the breast samples have historically been associated with the rare hereditary disease epidermodysplasia verruciformis but have more recently been shown in non-melanoma skin cancers and their precursors in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients.",
            "The confirmation of PCR-derived evidence of HPV sequences in nipple, areolar and tumour tissue by in situ hybridisation in our hands lends substantive support to the conjecture that viral sequences are present and not an artefact in the tissues we have examined.",
            "The absence of HPV DNA in several samples, as well as the detection of different HPV types in the carcinoma versus the nipple of the same patient, might be attributed to the viral load at the time of sampling in combination with the sensitivity of the tests performed.",
            "The tissue sections also harboured unaffected tissue, leading to the dilution of virus-containing cells.",
            "In addition, the amplification of viral DNA by PCR with degenerate or consensus primers will detect replicating viral sequences and is not sensitive enough to detect all individual HPV types with equal sensitivity in a mixed population of cells.",
            "The in situ hybridisation technique is also less sensitive and will not detect a single viral genome copy per cell.",
            "HPV 6 and HPV 11 are regarded as low-risk HPV types because they have only rarely been demonstrated in premalignant or malignant tissue, and the early genes E6 and E7 do not immortalise primary keratinocytes in vitro .",
            "HPV 6 DNA has been found in carcinomas and giant condylomas (Buschke\u2013L\u00f6wenstein tumours).",
            "The molecular mechanism by which these low-risk HPV types induce or participate in the transformation of cells has not been resolved.",
            "Duplications of the long control region, minimal sequence dissimilarities and integration of HPV 6 and/or HPV 11 genomes have been shown in malignant tissue.",
            "The mere presence of the low-risk HPV 6 and 11 in most of the mamillae and in the concomitant breast carcinoma samples does not prove its role in the aetiology of the disease, although it merits further investigation.",
            "Unfortunately, because of the previous fixation of our samples, RNA from these tumours was not available for the detection of viral transcripts as additional support of our results.",
            "Relatively few studies have been performed in an attempt to unravel the intracellular mechanisms through which HPV 6 or 11 may immortalise cells, and information is still fractional in comparison with data on the high-risk HPV types.",
            "Introduction of the HPV 6 E6 into normal mammary cells leads to immortalisation and reduced levels of the p53 protein.",
            "Binding of the HPV 6 E6 protein modulates the function of the cellular proteins Bak, Gps2 and Zyxin.",
            "Additional in vitro studies investigating the influence of hormones, smoke adducts and genetic factors on the interaction of the HPV 6 and 11 proteins with cellular proteins should provide valuable information on a possible role for HPV 6 and 11 in the pathogenesis of breast carcinoma.",
            "The data presented in this study also indicate a strong need for epidemiological studies correlating HPV, cigarette smoking, hormone use and family history to substantiate in vitro findings.",
            "This study suggests that human papillomavirus may infect the epithelium of the nipple and areola.",
            "Human papillomavirus infection may be identified with recognisable histological features comparable to human papillomavirus infection at other sites.",
            "Furthermore, this study is consistent with a pathogenic mechanism involving transfer in a retrograde fashion via the nipple, areola, lactiferous ducts and sinuses of the human papillomavirus.",
            "If confirmed, the pathogenic mechanism proposed may have significant implications for the prevention and treatment of breast carcinoma and the identification of individuals at risk for carcinoma development.",
            "Examination of cellular samples of nipple and areola inclusive of cytological examination and methods for identifying the presence of human papillomavirus might aid early diagnosis and perhaps therapy.",
            "Conclusions",

            "Background",
            "The relationship between breast cancer and organochlorine exposure is controversial and complex.",
            "As estrogen receptor positive and negative breast cancer may represent different entities of the disease, this study was undertaken to evaluate organochlorines influence on breast cancer risk and survival according to receptor status.",
            "Methods",
            "The background material stems from the Copenhagen City Heart Study (Denmark 1976-78).",
            "The breast cancer risk was investigated in a cohort nested case-control design including 161 cases and twice as many breast cancer free controls.",
            "The cases served as a cohort in the survival analysis.",
            "Serum organochlorine concentrations were determined by gaschromotography.",

            "Tumors in women with the highest dieldrin serum level were larger and more often spread at the time of diagnosis than ERP tumors.",
            "The risk of dying was for the remaining evaluated compounds higher among patients with ERP breast cancer when compared to those with ERN.",
            "In the highest quartile of polychlorinated biphenyls (\u03a3PCB) it was more than 2-fold increased (Relative risk [RR] I vs. IV quartile, 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.7), but no dose-response relation was apparent.",

            "Background",
            "Many organochlorines have become ubiquitous in the environment and in the human body due to their resistance to degradation and their high solubility in lipids, which leads to accumulation in adipose tissue.",
            "Some of these compounds are suspected of disrupting the endocrine system and thereby increasing the risk of hormone-dependent disorders and diseases such as breast cancer.",
            "Epidemiological studies indicate that total lifetime exposure to estrogen predict the risk of breast cancer.",
            "Estrogen also plays an important role for the prognosis of breast cancer as treatment with the anti-estrogenic drug tamoxifen improves the survival of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ERP) breast cancer.",
            "Furthermore, estrogen stimulates proliferation of ERP breast cell lines and may therefor be associated with ERP human breast cancers only.",
            "Previous studies of the potential effect of estrogenic organochlorines on breast cancer risk have yield inconsistent results and only a few has taken into account estrogen receptor status (ER).",
            "In a small Canadian study women with ERP tumors, but not those with estrogen receptor negative (ERN) tumors, had a higher DDE and PCB body burden compared to women with benign breast disease.",
            "An excess risk of developing an ERP breast cancer associated with exposure to certain PCB congener was also demonstrated in a study conducted in Sweden.",
            "In the so far only study on breast cancer survival, an adverse effect of exposure to dieldrin was identified, but ER was not obtained at that stage.",
            "It has been postulated that ERP and ERN are two different entities of breast cancer having different biological and etiological mechanisms.",
            "Thus, distinguishing between breast cancer which growth is dependent on estrogen and those which is not i.e.",

            "The background material constitutes the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS), which in 1976-78 enrolled a random sample of 10,317 women living within 10 wards of the National University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark.",
            "This study was designed as a cohort-nested case-control study, where the case group consisted of 268 women between 25 and 80 years of age diagnosed with primary breast cancer between initiation of the CCHS and end of follow up in 1993.",

            "The serum was analyzed for cholesterol, triglycerides, and the remaining volume frozen.",
            "After the 17 years of follow up stored serum was retrieved from 240 (89.5%) cases and 477 (89.0%) of the matched controls.",
            "Information on vital statistics, date of death until July 31 1997, breast cancer characteristics, and adjuvant treatment, were achieved through linkage to the Civil Registration System, the Causes of Death Registry, and the nation-wide clinical breast cancer trial conducted by the Danish Breast Cancer Co-operative Group.",
            "The latter was also able to provide information on where each woman diagnosed with breast cancer was treated.",
            "This made it possible to contact the pathology departments where the tumor tissue had been reviewed.",

            "Results",
            "The immunohistochemical estrogen receptor analysis showed that 72.0% (116 cases) had developed an ERP breast cancer and 28.0% (45 cases) an ERN cancers.",
            "Table 1 shows the measured lipid adjusted serum organochlorine concentration among these breast cancer cases.",
            "High body weight, nulliparity, and use of hormone replacement therapy were identified as overall breast cancer risk factors (data not shown) and were therefore included as covariates in the analyses of organochlorine compounds.",
            "The excess risk of breast cancer associated with high body weight and hormone replacement therapy after menopause derives from women who developed and ERN breast cancer, but was not statistical significant (table 2).",
            "The median duration of follow up with regard to death of all causes was 7.2 years; a total of 125 breast cancer patients died.",
            "The overall breast cancer survival was related to tumor size, degree of spread, and stage of disease (data not shown).",
            "These prognostic indicators were significantly associated with breast cancer tumors that were ERN (table 3).",
            "Women with the highest serum concentration of dieldrin had a more than seven-fold increased risk of developing an ERN breast cancer compared to women with the lowest concentration, and the risk increased in a stepwise fashion with increasing dieldrin exposure level.",
            "No association could be observed for the ERP tumors (table 4).",
            "The frequency of large tumors (size >50mm) at the highest dieldrin quartile exposure group was 27.3% (average size, 37 mm) and 8.7% (average size, 27 mm) for ERN and ERP tumors, respectively.",
            "The corresponding figures for spread of disease was 61.5% and 45.8%.",
            "For the remainder of the organochlorine compounds, ORs for the highest exposure level tended to be higher for women who developed an ERP breast cancer than those who had an ERN tumor, though none of the relationships reached statistical significance (table 4).",
            "In general, the risk of dying among women with the highest organochlorine exposure level was higher among women with ERP than ERN breast cancers, but the only statistical significant relationship was observed for \u03a3PCB (table 5).",
            "A statistically significant inverse trend was seen for exposure to HCB and \u03a3PCB in women with ERN tumors.",
            "Exposure to dieldrin was associated with a significant increased risk of dying for women with ERP tumors in the second and third quartile compared to the first quartile.",
            "An approximately 2-fold not significant increased risk of dying among women in the highest dieldrin exposure level compared to the lowest was observed for both ERP and ERN tumors (table 5).",
            "Similar results were obtained in analyses on a subgroup of 80 cases, where it was possible to adjust for tamoxifen therapy (data not shown).",
            "Including other organochlorines than the particular one in question in the multivariate analysis did not have any modifying effect on the observed estimates on breast cancer risk and survival.",
            "The cases on whom a tumor tissue specimen could not be obtained were older at the time of entrance into the CCHS (>60 years of age, 42.3% vs. 19.1%), older at the time of diagnosis (>71 years of age at diagnosis, 32.1% vs. 19.1%), and more often nulliparous (nulliparity, 33.3% vs. 24.1%) compared to those with an available specimen.",
            "Discussion",
            "It has been postulated that ERP and ERN breast cancers represent different entities of the disease.",
            "If this hypothesis is correct the risk factor profiles may differ between the two types of breast cancer, especially for hormone related factors as parity, hormone replacement therapy and body weight.",
            "The present study's results on these breast cancer risk factors according to ER are in accordance with previous epidemiological studies, which do not provide consistent evidence to conclude that development of ERP breast cancer is associated with exposure to estrogen related factors.",
            "Only few prior studies have evaluated the role of potential estrogenic organochlorines relationship to breast cancer risk while accounting for estrogen receptor status of the primary tumors.",
            "An excess risk of developing ERP breast cancers associated with exposure to certain PCB congeners, and DDE have been demonstrated.",
            "The present study could not confirm this.",
            "In fact, the previously reported excess risk observed with exposure to dieldrin derived from women who developed an ERN tumor.",
            "However, it is still uncertain what happens in the preclinical phases of breast cancer development.",
            "Low levels of available estrogen may stimulate estrogen receptor expression.",
            "It is also possible that down-regulation of the estrogen receptor gene to immunohisto-chemically undetectable levels may occur in some tumors due to high circulating levels of estrogens.",
            "A breast cancer initiated as an ERP cancer could therefor change receptor status during the process of carcinogenesis prior to diagnosis.",
            "Thus ER status may merely represent different stages in disease progress.",
            "Large tumors are more frequently heterogeneous with respect to estrogen receptor expression than small tumors.",
            "Consequently, a greater proportion of the large tumors will not exhibit estrogen reactivity at the time of diagnosis, although some part of it will be ERP.",
            "The tissue specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis may therefor not necessary reflect the original initiated breast cancer.",
            "These considerations may explain the present study's finding on dieldrin, as 27.3% of the ERN tumors among women in the highest exposure level had a diameter above 50 mm, while the corresponding figure for the ERP tumors was only 8.7%.",
            "Finally, it is possible that dieldrin is associated with a yet unidentified factor that modulates breast cancer risk.",
            "Whether exposure to estrogen related risk factors or organochlorines with estrogenic potential results in development of an ERP breast cancer cannot be determined from current evidence, but deserves more attention in future larger studies.",
            "In the only study evaluating the influence of organochlorines on overall survival of breast cancer, an adverse effect of dieldrin exposure was reported.",
            "When the ER of the tumor was taken into account in the analysis of dieldrin, the relative risk of dying in the highest exposure level was elevated in both patients with ERP and ERN tumors, though not significantly.",
            "An adverse effect of dieldrin on survival of women with ERP tumors could be anticipated, as this compound is able to stimulate the growth of human estrogen-sensitive cells.",
            "Another non-hormonal mechanism must lie behind the poorer prognosis of women with ERN tumors.",
            "Possibly, exposure to dieldrin may lead to development of a tumor with an increased inherent aggressiveness beyond what this study could take into account i.e. tumor size, degree of spread, and stage of disease.",
            "The significantly poorer prognosis observed for \u03a3PCB in women with ERP tumors is in accordance with the hormonal potential of some PCB congeners.",
            "The breast cancer's responsiveness to estrogen is exploited in endocrine surgery by removing the ovaries, and medically using drugs inhibiting the effects of estrogen on tumor cell growth.",
            "Worldwide results indicate that a 20% reduction in the five-year mortality is achieved by adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen in women over 50 years of age.",
            "The use of tamoxifen has become more frequent and is not only reserved for postmenopausal patients or patients with ERP tumors, because a proportion of up to 10% of ERN tumors is found to respond to the therapy as well.",
            "In this study tamoxifen was preferably administered to postmenopausal patients, but 26.3% of the patients who received this treatment had an ERN tumor.",
            "Tamoxifen competes with endogenous estrogen in binding to the receptor, and may therefore also block a possible effect of an estrogenic compound.",
            "However, adjustment for tamoxifen therapy in survival analyses on a sub-sample of the cohort (80 cases) did not substantially alter the observed results.",
            "The present study has several strengths.",
            "The participants were selected independently of risk of breast cancer and were followed for 17 years with regard to development of the disease.",
            "This time span allows the breast cancer to develop and takes into account the presumed long latency of this cancer.",
            "Furthermore, it is possible to give a long-term estimate for overall survival, as the median follow up with regard to death was 7.2 years.",
            "The substantial amount of information collected on the participants in the CCHS and the linkage to several relevant registries assured the ability to adjust for potential confounding, when evaluating both breast cancer risk and prognosis.",
            "The observed differences between cases eligible for and not eligible for assessing ER are unlikely to have affected the findings on breast cancer risk.",
            "Parity would be expected to be associated with lower organochlorine concentrations, as lactation is a main route by which these substances are excreted.",
            "Younger age would mean shorter duration of exposure and less accumulation.",
            "Thus, the study subjects included in the present study could have lower serum organochlorine concentrations and slightly lower risk of breast cancer than the CCHS cohort in general.",
            "Exclusion of cases diagnosed within 5 years of serum sampling did not affect the present results on risk and survival, and neither did mutual adjustment for organochlorine compounds.",
            "The Danish unique 10-digit ID-number issued to all persons living in and entering the country (by birth or immigration) insure the completeness of the undertaken linkages.",
            "Since 1942, the Danish Cancer Registry has registered all cases of cancer occurring in the entire Danish population; the registry is regarded virtually complete.",
            "DBCG has since 1976 been notified about new breast cancer cases by all Danish hospital departments.",
            "The present study was not designed as a classical survival study and blood samples for assessment of organochlorine exposure was taken on average 8.7 years before the patients were diagnosed with breast cancer.",
            "Given the changes in organochlorine concentrations over time, the study only indirectly addressed the question whether estrogen or estrogenic compounds determined in 1976-78 may interfere with the prognosis of ERP tumors.",
            "On the other hand, breast cancer is estimated to take several (8-10) years to reach a clinical detectable size, which mean that assessment of organochlorine exposure at the time of diagnosis will not reflect the level at tumor initiation.",
            "Even though this study included more breast cancer cases than most of the previous studies dealing with the organochlorine issue, it still has limited statistical power, especially in the analyses of ERN tumors.",
            "Conclusion",
            "The present study does not support the hypothesis that estrogen related risk factors or potential estrogenic organochlorines increase the risk of developing ERP tumors.",
            "In fact, it shows that exposure to dieldrin increases the risk of developing ERN tumors, which are larger and more often spread at the time of diagnosis.",
            "However, this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of ERN cases, so whether exposure to estrogenic organochlorine compounds affect the risk and prognosis of a hormone-responsive breast cancer needs to be clarified.",

            "Epidemiological findings indicate that both cryptorchid testis and testicular germ cell cancer may be a result of high maternal oestrogen levels early in pregnancy.",
            "An experiment was conducted with a mouse strain (129 Sv-S C P) in which the males are susceptible to testicular teratomas to determine if the frequency of undescended testis and testicular teratoma in male offspring could be increased by administration of ethinyl oestradiol (EE) to pregnant mice before day 13 of gestation.",
            "This point in gestation marks the completion of the migration of germ cells to the gonadal ridge in mice and other studies with these mice have shown that the tumours are initiated in this critical time period.",
            "EE mixed with corn oil was administered by subcutaneous injection in doses of 0.02 (n = 76) and 0.2 (n = 102) mg kg-of body weight on gestational days 11 and 12.",
            "These mice were allowed to deliver their offspring and the males were killed at 15 days of age.",
            "Since the tumours are present from birth, this amount of time was allowed to permit the tumours to reach sufficient size for easy visual identification.",
            "Compared to controls (n = 63), who received corn oil alone, the treated mothers produced offspring who were significantly more likely to have a cryptorchid testis (P = 0.0001) and who had an increased risk, although not significant, of a testicular teratoma.",
            "Crytorchidism is a known risk factor for human testicular cancer (Henderson et al., 1979; Schottenfeld et al., 1980;  Depue et al., 1983) and there is evidence that both conditions may share the common aetiological factor of high maternal oestrogen levels early in gestation.",
            "In animals, testicular maldescent has been experimentally produced by administer- ing oestrogen during gestation (Jean, 1973; McLachlan et al.,  1975; Nomura & Kanzaki, 1977; Yasuda et al., 1985).",
            "In humans, an increased frequency of cryptorchidism has been found in males who were exposed in utero to diethylstilbes- trol (DES) (Cosgrove et al., 1977; Whitehead & Leiter, 1981).",
            "Recently, it was shown that levels of free oestradiol measured in serum obtained during the first trimester of pregnancy of mothers bearing a cryptorchid son were significantly higher than those of control mothers (Bernstein et al., 1988).",
            "With regard to cancer of the testis (including seminoma and nonseminoma subtypes), epidemiological studies have indicated that high maternal oestrogen levels in the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the subsequent risk of germ cell tumours in male offspring (Henderson et al., 1979;  Depue et al., 1983).",
            "Both exogenous and endogenous sources of oestrogen have been implicated (Henderson et al., 1983;  Bernstein et al., 1986; Depue et al., 1987).",

            "Embryonal carcinoma cells appear to be the stem cells of these tumours and give rise to the differentiated cell types often observed.",
            "As the mouse becomes older the incidence of the embryonal carcinoma cells is much lower, due most likely to their differentiation into normal cells.",
            "As is usually the case, all of the embryonal carcinoma cells eventually disappear and the tumour is be- nign (Stevens, 1982).",
            "These tumours, which develop from the primordial germ cells, appear to be present by day 13 of gestation, by which time migration of germ cells to the gonadal ridge is com- pleted in the mouse (Chiquone, 1954).",
            "At gestational day 12.5 the germ cells are located in the medullary portion of the genital ridge, but by gestational day 13.5 they are located within the seminiferous tubules (Stevens, 1966).",

            "Experiments with these mice indicate that both genetic and environmental factors can affect the incidence of the tes- ticular teratomas.",
            "Factors that suggest an environmental effect include an increased incidence of teratomas in second litters versus first ones, and in left versus right testes.",
            "The latter phenomenon may be due to the relocation of the spermatic artery caused by the introduction of the gene iv (situs inversus viscerum) into the 129 strain of mice (Stevens, 1982).",
            "In addition, changing the location of the genital ridge during embryonic development, before gestational day 13, can increase the incidence of teratomas (Stevens & Mac-  kensen, 1961).",
            "When genital ridges from mouse fetuses of 12.5 days gestation were grafted on to adult testes of the same susceptible strain, teratomas developed in 82% of the grafts; whereas when the grafts were done at day 13.5 of gestation, teratomas occurred in only 8% of the grafts (Stevens, 1964).",
            "By altering the hormonal environment of the fetal testis in this susceptible mouse strain through maternal exposure before gestational day 13, it may be possible to increase the incidence of fetal testicular teratomas without removing the genital ridge from its normal location.",
            "Further, it would be expected that the incidence of cryptorchid testes would be increased with this type of exposure.",
            "The following experiment was designed to test these hypotheses.",

            "Animals and chemicals",
            "Inbred mice of the 129 Sv-S1 C P strain were provided by Dr Leroy Stevens from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA.",
            "This strain was derived from the mouse sub- line, called 129/Sv, which has a spontaneous incidence of testicular teratomas of about 1-2% (Stevens, 1984).",
            "The 129 Sv-SI C P strain has an incidence of teratomas of 7% among animals heterozygous for the S1 gene, which has been shown to affect the development of primordial germ cells.",
            "The C (pigment) and P (non-pinkeye) genes permit identification of the genotype of these animals from the phenotype.",
            "Animals with non-pigmented tail-tips are heterozygous for the S1 gene (S1/+), animals homozygous for the SI gene (SI/Si) are white and non-viable, and animals without the SI gene (+/+) have pigmented tail-tips (Stevens, 1984).",
            "A breeding colony was developed at the University of Southern California School of Medicine to produce mice for this study.",
            "Seven-week-old females in the experimental groups were mated to males of the opposite tail tip colour in order to produce approximately equal numbers of offspring with non-pigmented and pigmented tail tips (i.e. with and without the SI gene).",
            "Some older, previously untreated females who had had previous litters were also used in the experiment.",
            "After placement with the male (at a ratio of two females to one male per cage) the females were checked daily for the presence of a vaginal plug, and the day of that plug was considered to be day 0 of the pregnancy.",
            "Pregnant females were kept in individual cages and were fed mouse breeder pellets and water ad libitum.",
            "Ethinyl oestradiol (EE) was selected for use in this experiment because it has 200 times the biological activity of oestradiol (E2) and is used in oral contraceptives.",
            "Fetal exposure to this compound may occur if a woman continues to take oral contraceptives after conception, before realising that she is pregnant.",
            "The doses chosen for this experiment (0.02 and 0.2 mg kg-' body weight) are equivalent to about 20 and 200 times the amount that a 120 pound (54 kg) woman would receive daily when taking an oral contraceptive containing 50 jig of EE.",
            "EE was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO, USA), dissolved in DMSO, and diluted with corn oil.",
            "Experimental design",
            "A total of 241 females with vaginal plugs were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: a vehicle control (n = 63), a low dose EE group (0.02 mg EE per kg body weight) (n = 76), or a high dose EE group (0.2 mg EE per kg body weight) (n = 102).",
            "Due to the inbred nature of the strain and also to the effects of EE itself, only 118 or 49% of these females produced at least one viable male offspring, with the highest percentage occurring in the control group (60%) and the lowest in the high dose group (39%).",
            "Ten females in each group who produced at least one viable male offspring were multiparous at the time of mating.",
            "The total number of male offspring obtained per treatment group was: control, 107; low dose, 109; and high dose, 115.",
            "Because the transplant evidence suggests that teratoma induction occurs with greater frequency when the fetal testes are grafted before 13 days of gestation (Stevens, 1964), EE was administered before this time.",
            "An initial trial in which EE was administered on days 7-12 resulted in no offspring from 26 treated mothers.",
            "Thus, the exposure period was changed to days 11 and 12 in order to target the period of highest susceptibility and minimise the loss of offspring.",
            "The EE was administered by subcutaneous injection using repeating dispensers which delivered 20yl of the EE/corn oil solution with each injection.",
            "Controls were given 20 ft of corn oil in each injection.",
            "Concentrations of EE needed to deliver the required doses (0.02 and 0.2 mg kg-') were based on the mean weight of the animals in each treatment group obtained within 3 days of each injection.",
            "The females were allowed to deliver their pups and male offspring were killed at 15 days of age by CO2 asphyxiation.",
            "Since these tumours are present from birth (actually they have been observed in fetuses as early as 15 days of gestation: Stevens, 1962), offspring could have been killed earlier, but the 15 day period of time was selected to allow the tumours to reach sufficient size for easy visual identification.",
            "The testes were removed and examined for the presence of a tumour.",
            "Cryptorchidism of the testes was also noted and recorded.",
            "Histology",
            "The testes were fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution and embedded in paraffin.",
            "Five jAm sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin.",
            "All testes with suspected tu- mours, based on gross examination, were examined his- tologically as well as a 10% random sample of the testes which appeared normal.",
            "Statistics",
            "The risk of crytorchid testis and testicular teratoma in each treatment group was compared to that of controls using odds ratio estimates.",
            "Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios were computed (Mantel & Haenszel, 1959) and adjusted for tail-tip pigment and litter number, as these factors affect the incidence of spontaneous tumours.",

            "Results",
            "Cryptorchid testis",
            "In the three experimental groups (i.e. the controls, low dose EE and high dose EE groups) 331 male offspring were obtained and a cryptorchid testis was observed in 37.",
            "The undescended testes were almost exclusively on the left side (only two were found to be on the right side) and 81% (30/37) occurred among the mice with pigmented tail-tips (those without the S1 gene).",
            "A strong dose-response effect was found for the occur- rence of cryptorchid testis as a result of EE exposure, after statistical adjustment for litter number and tail-tip pigment (P = 0.000 1) (Table I).",
            "The adjusted odds ratios were 3.2 in the low dose group and 8.5 in the high dose group.",
            "Tumour incidence Testicular teratomas were observed in 24 mice based on the gross examination.",
            "All but one were confirmed to be a teratoma after histological examination.",
            "Nearly 70% (16/23) of the teratomas were found on the left side.",
            "They ranged in appearance from a barely visible discoloured nodule to larger tumours measuring up to 0.9 cm in diameter which completely replaced the testis.",
            "No tumours were found in a 10% random sample of other pairs of testes which were grossly normal.",
            "After statistically adjusting for the effects of tail-tip pig- ment and litter number, the risk of teratoma in the EE treated groups was more than double that for the corn oil control group (Table I), although these results were not statistically significant.",
            "No dose-response effect was ob- served (P = 0.37).",
            "Statistical adjustment for other factors, such as the tail-tip pigment of the father or occurrence of a cryptorchid testis, did not affect these results.",
            "The odds ratio obtained after combining both treatment groups and adjust- ing for tail-tip pigment (of the offspring) and litter number was 2.4 (95% CI, 0.7-9.1).",
            "Despite the fact that chance cannot be ruled out as an explanation for these findings, there was consistency in these results, with an increased incidence of tumours in the EE treated groups within the strata of litter number and tail-tip pigment (Table II).",
            "The increases due to EE treatment were most dramatic in the mice with non-pigmented tail-tips where the per cent with a teratoma increased from 3.1% among controls to 11.1% in first litter offspring exposed to either dose of EE, and from 14.3% to 23.8% in second litter mice.",
            "Joint occurrence of cryptorchid testis and teratoma",
            "Since the incidence rates for cryptorchid testis and for testic- ular teratoma are relatively low, the probability that both would occur in the same animal is quite low, if one assumes that they are independent events (i.e. that the joint prob- ability equals the product of the two independent probabil- ities).",
            "There were four animals observed with both outcomes and all were in the high-dose group.",
            "After stratifying on the offspring's tail-tip pigment and the mother's litter number, the expected number of animals having both outcomes among the treated groups was 1.61, assuming these two outcomes are independent events (Table III).",
            "The largest excess of observed versus expected was among pigmented tail-tip mice from second litters (3 versus 0.56).",
            "Discussion",
            "The results of this study show that administration of EE to pregnant mice of the 129 Sv-Sl C P strain before day 13 of gestation increases the risk of a cryptorchid testis in male offspring and suggest that the risk of a testicular teratoma may be increased as well.",
            "While the frequency of both out- comes appears to be related to oestrogen exposure, differences in the characteristics of animals developing these outcomes suggest that the aetiologic mechanisms may differ.",
            "The teratomas occurred more frequently in the non-pig- mented tail-tip mice and in second litter mice; and no dose-response effect was seen.",
            "Cryptorchid testes were ob- served more often in the pigmented mice and appeared unrelated to litter number; and a strong dose-response effect was found.",
            "The joint occurrence of both outcomes was more frequent than expected, suggesting that both mechanisms may operate within the same mouse during this critical exposure period which marks the completion of the migra- tion of the germ cells to the gonadal ridge.",
            "Testicular descent is thought to be a two stage process with both stages affected by hormal mechanisms (Hutson & Donahoe, 1986).",
            "Exposure in early pregnancy would affect the first stage (the initial transabdominal phase) which is thought to be regulated by mullerian inhibiting substance.",
            "Oestrogens have been shown to inhibit mullerian inhibiting substance (Newbold et al., 1984; Hutson et al., 1985) and cause atrophy of the gubernaculum (Wensing, 1973; Grocock  et al., 1988).",
            "The finding that elevated maternal oestrogen levels may increase the risk of a germ cell tumour is also supported by consideration of possible biological mechanisms.",
            "Regarding human testicular cancer, a mechanism has been suggested whereby high oestrogen levels adversely affect germ cells during their critical period of migration to the gonadal sites, which occurs during the fourth to sixth weeks of gestation (Henderson et al., 1983).",
            "Later, during puberty and in young adulthood, it is hypothesised that tumour growth is pro- moted by exposure to high gonadotropin levels, resulting in the peak incidence of testis cancer which occurs between 20 and 40 years of age (Henderson et al., 1983).",
            "A possible mechanism for the adverse affect of oestrogen on germ cells has been demonstrated by Yasuda et al.   (1986a, b) in studies using a non-susceptible mouse strain (jcl:ICR).",
            "In these studies pregnant females were exposed to the same concentrations of ethinyl oestradiol as used in the current study (i.e. 0.02 and 0.2 mg kg-' body weight) as well as 2.0 mg kg-' body weight during days 11-17 of gestation.",
            "The EE was mixed with olive oil and was administered by oral intubation; the fetuses were examined on gestational day 18.",
            "Electron microscopic examination of fetal gondal tissue revealed accelerated prespermatogenesis.",
            "This was attributed to the increased ratio of dark to light Sertoli cells which was found as a result of EE exposure.",
            "The dark Sertoli cells function to increase proliferation of germ cells, while the light Sertoli cells arrest this process (Wartenburg, 1981).",
            "In normal prenatal development, the light cells eventually pre- dominate, resulting in the arrest of germ cell proliferation until puberty.",
            "However, if the balance was shifted to the dark cells as a result of EE exposure, then germ cells may be induced to proliferate longer at an earlier stage.",
            "Other work by Yasuda et al. (1986b) has indicated that such levels of EE exposure also result in decreased testosterone synthesis by Leydig cells, causing a suppression of sperma- togenesis.",
            "Thus prenatal EE exposure appears to have a dual effect, resulting in accelerated prespermatogenesis due to the aAmong the control animals no animal had both outcomes.",

            "Studies with mice susceptible to teratomas (129/Sv-ter) have found that strains with low numbers of primordial germ cells and a prolonged proliferative period have the highest incidence of teratoma formation (Noguchi & Stevens, 1982).",
            "It appears that germ cells are most susceptible to teratocarcinogenesis while in their highest proliferative period.",
            "In summary, this experiment has demonstrated that maternal exposure to ethinyl oestradiol in the 129 Sv-S I C P mouse strain before a critical time period during gestation can affect testicular descent and may affect the incidence of testicular teratomas.",
            "Each of these events may be associated with oestrogen exposure through different aetiological mechanisms.",

            "Exposure to meth-y1chloroform also decreased the f,ormation of ,the two latter metabolites.",
            "No effects were observed following the exposure to n-hexane.",
            "Exposure to xylene increased the in vitro liver microsomal formation of 5a-androstane-3a,7p,17v5'-ttiol and 5a-androstane-3a,17,8,18-triol and decreased the formation of 5a-androstane-2a,3a,17,8-triol from 5a-androstane-3a,17fJ-diol.",
            "Methyl ethyl ketone increased the formation of 5aandrostane-2fJ,3a,17,8-triol, while methylchloroform reduced the formation of Saandrostane-3a, 7,8,17fJ-triol.",
            "No effects were observed follOWing the exposure to n-hexane.",
            "Discussion",
            "The results of this study and another recent study by Savolainen et al (26) imply that aromatic hydrocaflbon solvents such as xylene are potential inducing agents for cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome P-450dependent reactions in the liver.",
            "This assumption is also supported by the Similar effects of toluene on cytochrome P-450 (results to be published).",
            "Methyl ethyl ketone and me'thylchloroform do not seem to influence the total amount of liver microsomal 'cytochrome P-450 significantly, but they tend to depress some cytochrome P-450 dependent reactions.",
            "Although nhexane did not influence either the liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 or any of the ,cytochrome P-450-mediated reactions investigated, an induction of cytochrome P-450 has been reported after the exposure of mice to a higher dose during a short period of time (13).",
            "Similar results have also been reported with respect to the effects of me'thylchloroform on rats (10).",
            "These findings may suggest a dose-dependent influence of n-hexane and methylchloroform on cytochrome P-450, and they indicate the importance of the length of exposure.",
            "The inducing capacity of xylene may partly be due to the large uptake of xylene in comparison to the uptake of methylchloroform and aliphatic solvents (1, 29).",
            "SDS-polya'Crylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that xylene induced RLvMc P-450 50 and RLvMc P-45 0 54 , which are the same cytochrome P-450 forms that are induced to the greatest extent by phenobarbital (31).",
            "Furthermore, both xylene and phenobarbital increased the formation of 2-and 4-hydroxyb'iphenyl.",
            "Phenobarbital increased the formation of 4,5-dihydroxy-4,5-d~hydrobenzo{a)pyrene more than tenfold (31), while xylene increased the formation of this metabolite f'ivefo'ld.",
            "The metaboiism of androstenedione and androstanediol was also affected in a similar manner following exposure to xy-~en~or phenobarbital.",
            "These data strongly mdlcate that xylene is a phenobarbitallike inducer of liver microsomal cyto-chrome P-450 in the rat.",
            "Methyl ethyl ketone, methylchloroform, and n-hexane did not cause any detectable induction either in the total amount of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 or in the multiple forms, as demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.",
            "No increases were detected in the formation of the different metabolites of biphenyl or benzo{a)pyrene.",
            "However, methyl ethyl ketone and met'hylchloroform reduced the metabolism of the two mentioned substrates to some extent.",
            "Since cytochrome P-450 metabolizes endogenous substrates such as steroids, an induction of liver microsomal cytochrome P-4'50 may cause endocrine disturbances (22,24).",
            "Whether the increased in vitro formation of 16-hydroxy-androstenedione after xylene exposure or the decreased formation of 1!he same metabol'ite after methyl ethyl ketone and methylchloroform exposure are relevant for the in vivo situation remains to be established.",
            "It may be noted that reproduction disturbances have been reported in men exposed to organic solvents (8).",
            "The induction of hepatic cytochrome P-450 by xylene has several toxicological implications.",
            "An increased metabolism of xylene j'tself with an increased formation of p-tolualdeihyde from p-xylene can lead to the destruction of lung microsomal cytochrome P-450 after transport of the metabolite to the lung, as proposed by Patel et al (23).",
            "The increased formation of 4,5-dihydroxy-4,5~dihydrobenzo{a)py rene implies an accelerated formation of the mutagenrc 4,5-epoxy-4,5-dihydrobenzo-(a)pyrene (15).",
            "The toxicological importance of this metabolite may be questionable, however, in view of recent reports on the efficient deact'ivation of this compound by epoxide hydrase and glutathione-S-transferase (11,34).",
            "In contrast further metabolism of 7,8-dVhydroxy-7,8dihydrolbenzo(a)pyrene can lead to the formation of the very potent carc'inogen and mutagen 7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo{a)pyrene (15).",
            "When animals given phenobarbital are exposed to n\"':hexane, an increased formation of 2~hexanol occurs (9) and probably leads to an ac'celerated production of the neurotoxic metaJbolite 2,5-hexanedione.",
            "The hepatotoxicity of trichloroethylene and the covalent binding of trichloroethylene metabolites to DNA (deoxyribo-nucleVc add) increase after pretreatment with phenobarbital (2).",
            "Since xYilene is shown to be a phenobarbital-like inducer, it is reasonable to assume that synergistic toxic effects may occur upon simultaneous exposure to xylene and other solvents.",
            "of biphenyl and benzo(a)pyrene in rat liver microsomes after exposure to n-hexane, xylene, methyl ethyl ke'tone and methylchloroform Mean \u00b1 SO.",
            "The different cytochromes are referred to on the basis of the species, tissue, subcellular fraction, and molecular weight of the subunit as characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide g,el electrophoresis.",
            "Thus, RLvMc P-450so denotes rat liver micI\"osomal cytochrome P-450 with a subunit molecular weight of",

Evidence that the progesterone and androgen receptors can regulate the PSA gene independently was provided as follows: (a) the progestin norgestimate, which does not bind to the androgen receptor, up-regulates the PSA gene at concentrations as low as 10-10 M; (b) triamicinolone acetonide, which does not bind to the androgen receptor (AR) but binds to the PR, acts similarly to norgestimate; (c) the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate, which blocks the androgen receptor but has progestational activity, up-regulates the PSA gene at concentrations as low as 10-10 M; (d) the antiprogestin mifepristone completely blocks the stimulation of the specific progestin norgestimate.",

            "DISCUSSION",
            "The PSA gene is known to be regulated by androgens in the male prostate (Henttu et al, 1992; Levine, 1995).",
            "The epithelial cells of the prostate gland are rich in AR; some stromal cells also contain AR, as well as the enzyme 50x-reductase, which reduces testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (Levine, 1995).",
            "The PSA gene has a hormone response element (HRE) to which the activated AR can bind (Klobeck et al, 1989; Riegman et al, 1991; Murtha et al, 1993; Luke  and Coffey, 1994).",
            "The PSA gene is up-regulated by androgens and androgen agonists and is down-regulated by antiandrogens.",
            "We have recently shown that female breast tissue and breast secretions contain high levels of PSA (Diamandis and Yu, 1995).",
            "Although the physiological role of this protein in the female breast is still unknown, we have demonstrated that the presence of PSA is strongly associated with presence of steroid hormone receptors (Yu et al, 1994a).",
            "We have thus postulated that the PSA gene in the female breast is regulated by steroid hormones.",
            "In this study, we have developed a tissue culture system to further examine this regulation and study the involvement of the various steroid hormone receptors.",
            "We have first shown that the steroid hormone receptor-positive breast carcinoma cell line T-47D is capable of producing PSA under appropriate stimulation by steroid hormones.",
            "T-47D cells, as well as MCF-7 cells, do not produce PSA in the absence of steroid hormones (Yu et al, 1994b; Smith et al, 1995).",
            "The PSA mRNA produced by T-47D cells is, identical to the sequence of PSA mRNA from prostate cells.",
            "In contrast, the breast carcinoma cell line BT-20, which is devoid of steroid hormone receptors, did not produce PSA after stimulation by any of the compounds listed in Table 1.",
            "We have thus postulated that PSA production by breast cells is dependent on the steroid hormone-steroid hormone receptor system.",
            "We further demonstrated that the receptors and hormones are necessary but not sufficient for PSA production.",
            "When we stimulated the steroid hormone receptor-positive cell lines SAOS (osteosarcoma) and BG-1 (ovarian carcinoma) with the compounds shown in Table 1, none was able to induce PSA production.",
            "The presence of oestrogen and progesterone receptors in these cell lines was confirmed by analysis with established enzyme immunoassay kits (data not shown).",
            "Apparently, either post-receptor defects are present in these cell lines, the receptors are defective or the promoter of the PSA gene in these cell lines is tissue specific.",
            "These possibilities were not studied further.",
            "Among all androgenic compounds tested, only dihydroisoandrosterone sulphate, an inactive metabolite, was not able to stim- ulate PSA production.",
            "All other androgens were strong stimulators (Table 1).",
            "The physiological androgens testosterone and andros- terone and their reduced forms dihydrotestosterone and dihydroan- drosterone were able to induce PSA production at levels as low as 10-1u M and 10-11 M respectively.",
            "The lower active concentration of dihydrotestosterone (and dihydroandrosterone) is in accord with its higher affinity for the androgen receptor than testosterone (Levine, 1995).",
            "Strong stimulation was also observed with the synthetic compounds R1881 and R5020.",
            "In all cases tested, we observed a dose-response relationship.",
            "Although there is always a degree of cross-reactivity of steroid hormones with receptors other than the cognate receptors, the activity of androgens at levels around 10' M (a concentration 10to 100-fold lower than the affinity constant of the testosterone -AR complex) strongly suggests that the effect is mediated through high-affinity binding to the androgen receptor and not through low-affinity binding to cross-reacting receptors.",
            "Among the four oestrogens tested, the three natural oestrogens - oestradiol, oestrone and oestriol -did not mediate any PSA produc- tion.",
            "These data suggest that the oestrogen receptor is not involved in PSA gene up-regulation in the breast carcinoma cell line T-47D.",
            "17ax-Ethinyloestradiol, a synthetic oestrogen, was a weak but consistent stimulator at concentrations .10-8 M, suggesting that this steroid is not a pure oestrogen.",
            "Our data suggest that this steroid interacts with the androgen and/or the progesterone receptor leading to active complexes capable of weakly upregulating the PSA gene.",
            "Among the group of glucocorticoids tested, the physiological glucocorticoid hydrocortisone and the synthetic glucocorticoid prednisone had no effect.",
            "The strong induction of betamethasone and dexamethasone and the weak induction by corticosterone (at concentrations 2 10-8 M), all of which have higher affinities for the glucocorticoid receptor than hydrocortisone and cortisone and do not bind to either AR or PR (Ojasoo et al, 1988), suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor is capable of regulating the PSA gene as well.",
            "The PSA stimulation, at high glucocorticoid concentrations only, may reflect the low concentration of this receptor in T-47D cells (Glover and Darbre, 1989; Nordeen et al, 1989).",
            "With the exception of the inactive progesterone precursor 17axhydroxyprogesterone, all other progesterone agonists tested were strong stimulators of PSA production.",
            "In dose-response experiments, we have shown that the three tested progestins were active at levels 10-10-10 M.",
            "In particular, norgestimate, which exhibits highly specific high-affinity binding to the progesterone receptor than other progestin agonists (Phillips, 1990; Kafrissen, 1992;  Phillips et al, 1992) and binds to androgen receptor very poorly, was active at levels down to 10-10 M.",
            "The data presented for the progestin agonists, in combination with data from blocking experiments (discussed below), strongly suggest that the progesterone receptor, activated by progestin, is capable of directly up-regulating the PSA gene.",
            "In men, PSA gene regulation is under the control of testicular androgens through the androgen receptor.",
            "We speculate that in women, PSA gene regulation in organs such as the breast and the endrometrium (Clements and Mukhtar, 1994) is mediated by progestins and androgens through the independent action of the progesterone and the androgen receptor.",
            "Aldosterone, a natural mineralocorticoid, was capable of PSA regulation only weakly and at concentrations >10-8 M.",
            "Triamicinolone acetonide, a compound known to interact with the PR and GR but not the androgen receptor (Zava et al, 1979; Ojasoo et al, 1988) was found to strongly stimulate PSA production at concentrations as low as 10-10 M.",
            "This finding further strengthens our suggestion that the progesterone and glucocorticoid receptor can mediate PSA production without involvement of the AR.",
            "Among the four antioestrogens, none was able to mediate PSA production consistent with the suggestion that the oestrogen receptor is not involved in PSA gene up-regulation.",
            "Among the group of antiandrogens, we observed some interesting phenomena.",
            "All these compounds bind to the androgen receptor leading to either inactive complexes (pure antiandrogens) or to complexes with some biological stimulatory activity (antiandrogens with weak agonist activity).",
            "In our system, hydroxyflutamide, casodex and nilutamide (anandron), which are known to bind to the androgen receptor with low affinity (<2% of testosterone affinity) (Teutsch et  al, 1994), did not mediate any PSA production, suggesting forma- tion of weak and inactive complexes with the androgen receptor.",
            "Cyproterone acetate, which binds to the androgen receptor with affinity approximately 10% of that of testosterone (Teutsch et al,  1994), was found to be a strong stimulator of PSA production, with activity even at concentrations of approximately 10-10 M.",
            "These data suggest that cyproterone acetate, a known antiandrogen that also interacts with the progesterone receptor (Teutsch et al., 1994;Levine, 1995) and has biological progestational activity (Levine, 1995), exerts its action on PSA regulation through binding to the progesterone receptor.",
            "Our finding that cyproterone acetate can up- regulate the PSA gene through the progesterone receptor in parallel to its expected down regulation of the PSA gene through androgen receptor blockade requires further investigation as monitoring PSA levels during cyproterone acetate treatment of prostate cancer may not be a reliable index of clinical response.",
            "Up-regulation of the PSA gene by cyproterone acetate through its progestational activity has not, to our knowledge, as yet been reported.",
            "It is currently unknown if this indeed happens in prostate cells in addition to breast cancer cell lines.",
            "The newer antiandrogen RU56, 187 has affinity for the androgen receptor similar to testosterone but no detectable affinity for progesterone, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid or oestrogen receptors (Teutsch et al, 1994).",
            "In our system, we detected weak PSA gene up-regulation at RU56, 187 concentration .10-8 M.",
            "This up-regulation strongly suggests that RU56,187 has weak androgen agonist activity.",
            "In this respect, our tissue culture system appears to be more sensitive than the in vitro systems used by Teutsch et al  (1994) to evaluate RU56,187, concluding that this compound is totally devoid of binding to other steroid receptors and of any agonist effect.",
            "It remains to be determined if the weak agonist activity of RU56,187 has any biological significance.",
            "Mifepristone (RU486, RU38,486) is a new antiprogestational agent with antiglucocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity.",
            "RU486 has been commercialized as an antiprogestin for first trimester pregnancy interruption.",
            "In our system, we found that Mifepristone has weak agonist activity, mediating PSA gene up-regulation at concentrations .10-8 M.",
            "This agonist activity was not observed by Philibert et al (1985), further suggesting that their biological tests are not as sensitive as our tissue culture system in detecting such an effect.",
            "In support of our data are reports by others showing weak agonist activity of RU486 in various systems (Gravanis et  al, 1985; Gronemeyer et al, 1991; Wehle et al, 1995).",
            "It remains to be seen if the weak agonist activity of mifepristone is mediated by the androgen, glucocorticoid or the progesterone receptor.",
            "Very weak agonist activity was also observed for the antiglucocorticoid cortexolone and the antimineralocorticoid spironolactone at concentrations 2 10-7 M.",
            "While oestradiol has no positive effect on PSA gene regulation, blocking experiments have revealed that oestradiol could block the action of dihydrotestosterone and to a much lesser degree norgestrel but not norgestimate on PSA gene regulation (Table 2).",
            "There are two possible explanations for this phenomenon.",
            "First, high doses of oestradiol could cause its binding to the androgen receptor thus blocking the action of dihydrotestosterone (Ojasoo et  al, 1988; Lea et al, 1989).",
            "Second, oestradiol would bind to the oestrogen receptor in T-47D cells and the active complex would further inhibit the action of active AR complexes.",
            "Active ER, AR and PR complexes compete for the same transcription factors including c-jun and c-fos as suggested previously (Pearce and Yamamoto, 1993).",
            "The fact that oestradiol blocks the stimulation by dihydrotestosterone but not the stimulation by norgestimate suggests that oestradiol blockade targets the AR but not the PR.",
            "Our finding of positive regulation of the PSA gene by androgen and progestin and the negative regulation by oestrogen suggests that PSA is regulated by a delicate balance between androgens, progestins and oestrogens.",
            "Nilutamide and hydroxyflutamide, two antiandrogens that bind with low affinity to the androgen receptor, had moderate but not complete blocking activity (-30-40% on average) on dihy- drotestosterone and an even lower blocking activity (<20%) on norgestrel and no blocking activity on norgestimate.",
            "These data are expected as the stimulating steroids (e.g. dihydrotestosterone), having higher affinity for the androgen receptor, would displace a fraction of the blocker after they are added into the tissue culture system.",
            "On the other hand, RU56, 187, which has an affinity for the androgen receptor similar to testosterone, was able to block 85-91% of the activity of dihydrotestosterone.",
            "The lower blockade on norgestrel action (17-40% on average) and the absence of blockade on norgestimate action further suggests that a significant portion of norgestrel's and 100% of norgestimate's stimulation is mediated through the progesterone receptor to which RU56, 187 does not bind and could not block.",
            "The antioestrogen ICI 182, 780 had little or no blocking effect on the stimulation of PSA production by dihydrotestosterone, norgestrel or norgestimate, in accordance with our view that the oestrogen receptor does not positively mediate PSA production in our system.",
            "Mifepristone was an effective blocker of PSA production by dihydrotestosterone (70-80%) and an almost complete blocker of norgestrel and norgestimate (90-100%).",
            "This is in accord with our view that PSA production is mediated independently by the AR and the PR as mifepristone is known to block effectively the progesterone receptor and to a lesser but significant degree the androgen receptor (Philibert et al, 1985).",
            "As expected, the antiglucocorticoid cortexolone and the anti- mineralocorticoid spironolactone had no effect on either dihydrotestosterone, norgestrel or norgestimate action as these two anti-hormones bind primarily to GR and MR and only with low affinity to other receptors that are involved in PSA production.",
            "Taken together, our data suggest the following: the breast carci- noma cell line T-47D has the necessary receptors and other tran- scriptional machinery to produce PSA.",
            "Once stimulated by a steroid hormone, T-47D cells produce PSA mRNA within 1-2 h, synthesize detectable intracellular protein within 4 h and secrete detectable protein within 8 h.",
            "PSA gene regulation is under the control of androgens and progestins through the independent action of the androgen and progesterone receptors (positive regulation).",
            "Weak positive regulation may also be effected by high concentrations of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.",
            "Oestro- gens do not positively regulate the PSA gene but they act as blockers of androgen action.",
            "The most effective blockers of PSA gene regulation were found to be the anti-androgen RU56, 187 and the antiprogestin mifepristone.",
            "Our data, showing multihormone regulation of the PSA gene, are in accord with these of Glover and  Darbe (1989) who concluded the same using T-47D cells trans- fected with the mammary tumour virus long terminal repeat sequences.",
            "Our tissue culture system not only reproduces the phenomenon of PSA production by breast cancers but it also offers a means of testing the biological activity of candidate new hormonal and anti-hormonal agents.",
            "With this system, we have shown that two new anti-hormones, the antiandrogen RU56, 187 and the antiprogestin mifepristone, which were found to be completely devoid of agonist activity by traditional in vivo and in vitro tech- niques, have low but detectable androgen and/or progestin agonist activity demonstrated by their ability to upregulate the PSA gene.",
            "Recently, we have obtained evidence that the progestin-mediated upregulation of the PSA gene occurs in vivo as well.",
            "We have reported PSA production by normal breast tissue in a female patient who was receiving an oral contraceptive containing norethidrone (Yu et al, 1995).",
            "PSA regulation by progestins in the prostate has not been reported but it is known that the prostate cells, in addition to AR, also contain PR (Mobbs and Liu, 1990).",
            "In another report, we described a patient who was receiving high doses of glucocorticoids and had an ovarian tumour producing PSA (Yu et al, 1995c).",
            "Our data further supports the view that PSA may be regulated in diverse tissues containing PR.",
            "Tissues which contain PR include the breast (Yu et al, 1994a), the endometrium (Clements and  Mukhtar, 1994), brain meningiomas (Carrol et al, 1993), blood vessel walls (Bergqvist et al, 1993), urinary tract (Pacchioni et al,  1992) and osteoclasts (Boivin et al, 1994).",
            "In view of these and other findings, we believe that it is time to study in detail the biological role of PSA in non-prostatic tissues.",
            "The presence of a significant prognostic value of this molecule in breast cancer (Yu  et al, 1995b) suggests that this elegantly regulated enzyme may play some role in breast cancer initiation and progression.",

            "The aim of this study was to identify associations between exposure to iron and welding fumes and the incidence of lung cancer among Finnish men.",
            "Methods",
            "The cohort of all economically active Finnish men, born in 1906-1945, who participated in the national census in 1970 was followed through the Finnish Cancer Registry for lung cancer cases (N=30 137) during 1971-1995.",
            "Their census occupations in 1970 were converted to estimates of cumulative exposure to iron and welding fumes with the Finnish job-exposure matrix on the basis of likelihood, average level, and estimated duration of exposure.",
            "Relative risk estimates for categorized cumulative exposure were defined by a Poisson regression, adjusted for smoking, socioeconomic status, and exposure to asbestos and silica dust.",
            "Results",
            "The relative risks for lung cancer increased as the cumulative exposure to iron and welding fumes increased.",
            "The relative risks in the highest exposure category was 1.35 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.05-1.73] for iron and 1.15 (95% CI 0.90-1.46) for welding fumes.",
            "The respective relative risks estimated for squamous-cell carcinoma of the lungs were 1.94 (95% CI 1.35-2.78) and 1.55 (95% CI 1.08-2.24).",
            "There was no excess risk of small-cell carcinoma in any exposure category.",
            "Conclusions Occupational exposure to iron and welding fumes was associated with an increase in lung cancer risk, mainly that of squamous-cell carcinoma.",
            "The simultaneous exposure to both of these agents and other potential work-related carcinogens complicates the interpretation of the independent roles of the risk factors.",
            "There is extensive exposure to iron fumes or dust and welding fumes in the work environment across various industries worldwide.",
            "In Finland, the estimated number of workers exposed to iron fumes or dust or welding fumes in 1960-1984 was about 100 000 (ie, 4% of the 2.3 million economically active population) (1).",
            "Twothirds of them were exposed to welding fumes, which contain iron fumes as one component.",
            "If it is assumed that 1% of the 2.9 billion global workforce perform welding as part of their work duties, the number of exposed workers would be about 30 million.",
            "In Finland, the most common occupations with exposure to welding fumes are welder (N=15 000), machine and engine mechanic (N=12 000), sheet metal worker (N=15 000), and plumber (N=12 000).",
            "There are also occupations with no exposure to welding fumes but which have exposure to iron fumes or dust, such as foundry and steel work.",
            "Due to the widespread exposure, the number of cancer cases attributable to exposure to iron fumes or dust or welding fumes would be very high if iron fumes or dust or welding fumes turn out to be carcinogenic.",
            "In 1990, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) categorized welding fumes as possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B) on the basis on 23 epidemiologic studies.",
            "The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) concluded that there is an elevated risk of lung cancer among welders that cannot be completely accounted for by smoking or asbestos exposure (2).",
            "More recent papers also support the view that welding fumes could increase the risk of lung cancer (3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10).",
            "On the other hand, iron dust and fumes were not classified as carcinogenic by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (10), and they have Siew et al not been evaluated by IARC.",
            "Although numerous studies suggest that there is an association between exposure to iron fumes or dust at work and lung cancer risk (11)(12)(13)(14), the possible effect from other agents in simultaneous exposure could not be ruled out completely.",
            "Exposure to iron fumes or dust and welding fumes is associated because the main constituent of welding fumes is iron and its compounds.",
            "In most cancer studies in relation to welding fumes, iron is generally neglected because the focus falls upon nickel, chromium or chromium VI, and other possible carcinogens.",
            "In addition, there has been a debate about whether exposure to mild steel or stainless steel could lead to an increased risk of lung cancer among welders.",
            "The aim of our present study was to identify the exposure-response relationship of occupational exposure with -response relationship of occupational exposure with response relationship of occupational exposure with iron fumes or dust and welding fumes and the risk of lung cancer in a follow-up of the entire Finnish workforce.",

            "Data on the occupations held for the longest time in 1970 were obtained from the population census 1970 records (15).",
            "The occupational classification was based on a modification of the International Standard Classification of Occupations in 1958.",
            "Some of the 311 basic occupational codes were further divided according to industry.",
            "The cohort was also categorized into the following five socioeconomic strata: higher white-collar, clerical, skilled blue-collar, and unskilled workers, and also farmers.",

            "In our present study, the incident cases of lung cancer diagnosed between 1971 and 1995 among men born between 1906 and 1945 (30 137 cases) were extracted from the Finnish Cancer Register and sent to Statistics Finland for linkage with the data in the population census in 1970.",

            "Each occupational category is characterized by the proportion of exposed persons (P) and the mean level of exposure among the exposed (L).",
            "The exposure estimates were based on the judgment of about 20 experts at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health.",

            "Occupations that had more than 5% of the persons exposed to the individual agent at any time between 1945 and 1984 are considered as potentially exposed occupations in the FINJEM.",
            "For welding fumes, the Pvalues were collected mainly from the work and health surveys carried out by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in 1997-2003, whereas the mean levels of exposure were estimated on the basis of exposure measurements made by the the same institute.",
            "The FINJEM also includes exposure estimates for asbestos, silica, nickel, chromium, lead, benzo(a)pyrene, and smoking, which are potential confounders in our current study.",
            "Smoking is expressed as the proportion of those in the occupation who smoked daily, according to data from annual surveys on the health behavior of the Finnish adult population in 1978-1991 (18).",
            "We estimated the agent-specific and occupation-specific cumulative exposure (cumulative exposure) for every 5-year birth cohort (from 1906-1910 to 1941-1945) and 5-year calendar periods of observation from 1971-1975 to 1991-1995 (figure 1).",
            "For each birth cohort, it was assumed that the exposure started when the average age of the birth cohort was 20 years and ended in the middle year of the observation period minus 20 years (latency) or at 65 years of age, whichever came first.",
            "In each calendar year, the annual average exposure was the product of the proportion of exposed persons and the mean level of exposure in that occupation.",
            "When the exposure occurred before 1960, we used the FINJEM estimates for the period 1945-1959; otherwise the estimates for the period 1960-1984 were used.",
            "The limits of the cumulative exposure categories for all of the chemical agents were set a priori on the basis Iron and welding fume exposure and the risk of lung cancer of the distribution of the exposures in such a way that the highest category included only the cluster of workers with evidently the highest exposure (ie, not automatically to include, for example, one-fourth of the population).",
            "The rest of the potentially exposed workers were divided into medium and low categories.",
            "The categorized cumulative exposures to iron fumes or dust were 0.1-9.9 mg/m 3 -years (low), 10-49.9 mg/m 3 -years (medium), and \u226550 mg/m 3 -years.",
            "The respective thresholds for welding fumes were 100 and 200 mg/m 3 -years.",
            "The expected numbers of cases for every occupation were calculated for each 5-year birth cohort and 5-year calendar period (figure 1) by multiplying person-years lived by persons in that occupation with the cancer incidence rate of the entire Finnish population in the respective stratum.",

            "Thirty-three workers exposed to Co and W in workshops producing either diamond tools or hard-metal mechanical parts participated in this study.",
            "Two EBC and urinary samples were collected: one before and one at the end of the work shift.",
            "Controls were selected among nonexposed workers.",
            "Co, W, and MDA in EBC were analyzed with analytical methods based on mass spectrometric reference techniques.",
            "In the EBC from controls, Co was detectable at ultratrace levels, whereas W was undetectable.",
            "In exposed workers, EBC Co ranged from a few to several hundred nanomoles per liter.",
            "Corresponding W levels ranged from undetectable to several tens of nanomoles per liter.",
            "A parallel trend was observed for much higher urinary levels.",
            "Both Co and W in biological media were higher at the end of the work shift in comparison with preexposure values.",
            "In EBC, MDA levels were increased depending on Co concentration and were enhanced by coexposure to W. Such a correlation between EBC MDA and both Co and W levels was not observed with urinary concentration of either element.",
            "These results suggest the potential usefulness of EBC to complete and integrate biomonitoring and health surveillance procedures among workers exposed to mixtures of transition elements and hard metals.",
            "Cobalt is a transition element occurring in four valences (0, +2, +3, and +4), the divalent oxidation state being the most common.",
            "Tungsten, also known as wolfram (W), is a hard metal that can occur in the natural state only in the form of chemical compounds with other elements.",
            "Co is a major constituent (5\u201310%) of hard metal alloys, mainly based (> 80%) on tungsten carbide (W-C) and small percentages of other carbides.",
            "Other industrial uses of Co include diamond polishing with Co-containing disks and production of drying agents, pigments, and catalysts.",
            "W and its alloys are used extensively for filaments for electric lamps, electron and television tubes, and metal evaporation work.",
            "W has no recognized physiologic roles, whereas Co is a cofactor of vitamin B12 and therefore is an essential element.",
            "Occupational exposure to Co can lead to various lung diseases, such as interstitial pneumonitis, fibrosis, and asthma [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ].",
            "Although the mechanisms of Co-induced lung toxicity are not completely known, there is evidence from both in vivo and in vitro experiments supporting the view that Co induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with subsequent oxidative stress [reviewed by ].",
            "In addition, ROS generation by Co administration is significantly increased by coexposure to W-C particles, through a physical\u2013chemical mechanism of interaction.",
            "Although W-C alone seems to cause marginal genotoxic effects, when administered alone it would be unable to induce lung parenchymal lesions and oxidative stress.",
            "Although Co was classified as group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans [International Agency for Research on Cancer ], its association with W-C has recently been included in group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans.",
            "Therefore, strict control of dust level and regular health monitoring are recommended for workers employed in the hard metal industry, where such a coexposure may occur.",
            "Urinary Co excretion (Co-U) has been proposed as a biomarker of exposure because of its correlation with airborne Co concentration.",
            "Little information is available about W metabolism and kinetics, mainly because of the lack of suitable methods for its determination in biological matrices other than the relatively recent and expensive technique based on inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).",
            "W measurement in urine has been proposed as a suitable exposure biomarker in the hard metal industry, where exposure to W-C is variable and has been reported to reach 417 \u03bcg/m3.",
            "A key issue for risk assessment in occupational health is the characterization of dose at the target organ level.",
            "In the case of inhalable pneumotoxic metals, such as Co and W, a noninvasive method for sampling from the lung would be extremely useful.",
            "Standard methods for the evaluation of lung pathobiology (bronchoscopy, induced sputum) have a high degree of invasiveness, which limits their applicability to occupational monitoring.",
            "Exhaled breath condensate (EBC), obtained by cooling exhaled air under condition of spontaneous breathing, is a new technique to assess pulmonary status, and published data suggest that its composition has a good correlation with bronchoscopic specimens.",
            "EBC is a noninvasive and simple procedure, and portable devices have been developed; therefore, it has the potential for application in occupational settings.",
            "Preliminary studies on smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have revealed that several toxic metals and trace elements are detectable in EBC, raising the possibility of using this new matrix to quantify the lung tissue dose of pneumotoxic substances.",
            "Furthermore, EBC analysis can be used to quantify relevant biomarkers reflecting lipid peroxidation of membrane cells.",
            "To the best of our knowledge, EBC analysis has never been used in occupational settings.",
            "The aim of the present study was to investigate whether EBC can be employed for a better risk assessment among workers exposed to pneumotoxic metals, using workers from the hard metal industry as a first paradigmatic application.",

            "Groups A and B were exposed either to Co and W-C powders, which were mixed to produce hard-metal alloys by synterization, or to metal dust originating from dry-grinding activities.",
            "Subjects from group C were exposed to metal dust produced during the dry grinding of hard-metal pieces.",
            "Sixteen adult healthy subjects, not occupationally exposed to metals, were recruited as the control group.",

            "Two subjects from group A and one from group C had a history of mild intermittent asthma, and both were under therapy with inhaled salbutamol as needed.",
            "One subject from group B had radiologic evidence of pulmonary fibrosis ascribed to the occupational exposure to hard metals.",
            "All other workers were asymptomatic and did not refer a significant current or past respiratory diseases.",
            "Symptoms of acute respiratory illness within the 4 weeks preceding the study were ruled out in all subjects.",

            "Discussion",
            "The present study demonstrates that Co and W can be measured in the EBC of occupationally exposed workers and thus suggests the potential use of this matrix as a novel approach to monitor target tissue dose and effects occurring in the respiratory tract upon exposure to pneumotoxic substances.",
            "Indeed, inhaled toxic chemicals can act locally on the lung, which represents the route of entry of most environmental pollutants.",
            "Biological monitoring of exposure to trace elements and toxic metals is mainly based on their measurement in blood and urine.",
            "However, these biomarkers integrate the overall intake from different absorption routes and can be used to assess the risk of systemic effects, rather than local effects on the respiratory tract.",
            "These limitations are confirmed in the present study by the lack of correlation between either Co-U or W-U and MDA concentration in EBC.",
            "On the contrary, both Co and W in EBC were correlated with MDA-EBC levels, thus suggesting that exhaled elements may reflect the lung dose responsible for local toxic effects.",
            "In addition, the relationship between Co levels in EBC and urine seems to indicate that Co-EBC really may represent the fraction of body dose (represented by Co-U), which has been inhaled and has not yet moved from lung tissue in the systemic circulation at the sampling time.",
            "However, the relatively weak (for W in particular) correlation between Co and W levels in EBC and the respective urinary levels suggests that other absorption routes (i.e., dermal and oral absorption) may provide a sizable contribution to absorbed dose and subsequent urinary excretion.",
            "Furthermore, the different bioavailability and solubility of Co and W could account for the weak correlation between the levels into two compartments.",
            "Because of the novelty of the EBC measurements, the analytical validity of determinations was strictly controlled.",
            "We employed analytical methods based on mass spectrometric reference techniques, namely, LC-MS/MS for MDA and FI ICP-MS for metals, in order to obtain accurate and reliable results.",
            "Compared with other biological matrices, such as urine and blood, EBC represents a \u201cclean\u201d matrix, consisting mostly of water.",
            "The reliability of the elemental measurements in EBC was also assessed by performing the analysis of Co in EBC samples with two techniques relying on different principles, namely, FI ICP-MS and ETAAS-Z.",
            "The results showed a high repeatability, and therefore Co in EBC can be easily measured relying on a readily available technique such as ETAAS-Z.",
            "The assessment of metal concentrations in different biological fluids can also provide useful information about kinetics and a better comprehension of physical\u2013chemical interactions between metals, for example, between Co and W.",
            "In the present study, Co-U was related to both air concentrations and Co-EBC, despite the lack of correlation between Co-EBC and airborne Co.",
            "This could be consistent with a fast kinetic of inhaled",
            "Co, which can be readily absorbed via the lungs in the organism.",
            "Therefore, we speculate that Co-EBC reflects not only exposure but also the amount of the element retained in the lung and eliminated with exhaled air after its interaction with\u2014and possibly damage to\u2014resident cells.",
            "In fact, there is a relationship between MDA-EBC (a marker of lipoperoxidation of membranes) and Co-EBC, which might represent a marker of effective dose or dose at the target.",
            "The correlation between MDA-EBC and Co-EBC is consistent with the mechanism of action of Co, which is known to cause oxidative stress.",
            "Considering that Co-U decreases rapidly (within 24 hr) after Co exposure has ceased, it is likely that the kinetics of absorption of Co at the level of the primary target organ (respiratory tract) are even faster.",
            "This is also consistent with the drastic drop in Co-EBC values at preexposure level about 16 hr after the last exposure.",
            "A better understanding of the physical\u2013chemical interactions between Co and W in vivo is another issue to which EBC can contribute.",
            "Exposure to W was quite different despite a similar productive cycle, probably depending on a different composition of hard metal alloys (covered by industrial secrets) and, perhaps, on different behaviors of workers from the point of view of personal hygiene.",
            "In a couple of outliers, urinary levels were higher by orders of magnitude than expected on the basis of the corresponding air and EBC concentrations.",
            "The significant Co-EBC by W-EBC interaction in the ANCOVA model with MDA-EBC as a dependent variable strongly suggests that W exposure has a synergistic effect in vivo on Co pneumotoxicity.",
            "This is in agreement with published data obtained from in vitro experiments.",
            "In fact, although W-C alone is known to be inert, there is some evidence that the physical\u2013chemical association of Co and W-C generates electrons (provided by Co and transferred on the surface of W-C), which can reduce oxygen, thus giving rise to ROS.",
            "Although Figure 2 shows that the levels of Co and W in EBC and urine are factory dependent, the concentration of MDA in EBC is strongly associated with both Co and W levels in EBC, thus confirming the most recent understanding of hard metal lung disease as a consequence of the combined effects of these elements.",
            "In conclusion, the present study shows that EBC analysis is a promising matrix to assess the target tissue dose of pneumotoxic substances from polluted workplaces and to assess early effect markers, such as MDA."

            "Birth Weight and Exposure to Kitchen Wood Smoke During Pregnancy in Rural Guatemala",
            "Low birth weight (LBW), defined as birth weight < 2,500 g, is well established as an important risk factor for infant mortality and morbidity.",
            "Well over 90% of all LBW babies are born in developing countries, where approximately 18% of newborns weigh less than 2,500 g 2 .",
            "In Guatemala, for the period 1990-1994, 14% of all births fell into this category (1), although there are substantial variations within the country (2).",
            "LBW results from a wide range of factors that determine premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation, or combinations of both of these outcomes (3).",
            "Any conditions that interfere with transplacental delivery of nutrients, oxygen included, may cause varying degrees and types of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).",
            "Of the environmental factors linked with reduced birth weight, tobacco smoking-both active and passivehas probably been the most extensively studied (4)(5)(6)(7)(8).",
            "Active smoking is associated with a mean reduction in birth weight of up to 200 g, whereas passive smoking has a smaller effect variously estimated at 20-120 g (9)(10)(11)(12).",
            "A recent meta-analysis reported a weighted estimate of 28 g, with a greater decrement of 40 g when pooling was restricted to the more homogeneous studies (8).",
            "Tobacco Smoke, Biofuels, and Low Birth Weight",
            "Although over 4,000 substances have been identified in cigarette smoke, only a few dozen are singled out as important from a health perspective.",
            "Carbon monoxide (CO) in particular and possibly nicotine are regarded as the agents most likely to be responsible for detrimental effects on intrauterine growth (10,13,14).",
            "CO results from the incomplete combustion of any biomass, which includes tobacco and biofuels (wood, dung, and fiber residues) as well as fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which are used for cooking and heating (15).",
            "Once inhaled, CO combines with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), a much more stable compound that does not readily give up O 2 to peripheral tissues and organs, including the fetus.",
            "In terms of emissions of suspended particulates and pollutant gases, the combustion of wood and other biomass is qualitatively similar to the burning of tobacco, although without the nicotine.",
            "Studies have shown that exposure to biofuels is associated with COHb levels of 2.5-13% (16,17), covering the range seen for passive through heavy active smoking (18,19).",
            "It is therefore not unreasonable to expect that the effect of passive smoking on birth weight would also apply to pregnant women habitually exposed to high levels of biofuel smoke, as is the case in developing countries (20,21).",
            "However, despite the theoretical similarity between passive tobacco smoking and prolonged indoor exposure to high levels of wood smoke, we are not aware of any previous published studies that have examined the effects of the latter on human fetal growth.",
            "Around two-thirds of households in developing countries still rely on biofuels as their primary fuel (22), and unless there is a major change in energy and development policy in developing countries, such use will continue for the forseeable future (23).",
            "It is now recognized that indoor use of biofuel in rural communities is responsible not only for some of the highest levels of ambient air pollution ever recorded (15) but also for about half the global burden of exposure to airborne pollutants (24).",
            "It is therefore essential to examine the effect of indoor smoke exposure and LBW in developing countries.",
            "Our study had the following objectives: to quantify the influence of biofuels use on birth weight, and to measure and control for potential confounding factors such as maternal education, health and nutritional status, and socioeconomic conditions.",

            "Background information on study area.",
            "The study was performed in Quetzaltenango, a mountainous province in western Guatemala, where the prevalence of LBW was estimated at 18% in 1988 (24).",
            "In the National Micronutients Survey, performed by the Ministry of Public Health in 1995 (25), the prevalence of anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dL) corrected for altitude and pregnancy among women ages 15-48 years in the western highlands was 39%, the highest regional value for the country.",
            "Malaria is not endemic in the study districts because of the high altitude (2,300-2,700 m).",
            "At least 70%",
            "In this study, we aimed to establish whether domestic use of wood fuel is associated with reduced birth weight, independent of key maternal, social, and economic confounding factors.",
            "We studied 1,717 women and newborn children in rural and urban communities in rural Guatemala.",
            "We identified subjects through home births reported by traditional birth attendants in six rural dis- Children's Health Articles of all deliveries occur at home, and 95% of these with the assistance of traditional birth attendants.",
            "The study was performed in 6 of the 22 districts of Quetzaltenango province as well as the provincial capital.",
            "Women and their babies were recruited from home births (n = 572) and hospital births (n = 1,145).",
            "Home deliveries.",
            "During 6 consecutive months (October-March), data were collected prenatally on 572 pregnant women in their second or third trimester by seven trained female field workers living within the six districts (San Juan, Almolonga, Olintepeque, Concepci\u00f3n, Sibilia, and Sija).",
            "All district townships were within a 20-km radius of the provincial capital.",
            "Pregnant women were either referred to the field workers by volunteer traditional birth attendants or directly identified by the field workers at the larger villages within each district.",
            "Subjects were included if the newborn was alive by the time of the first visit (within 72 hr after delivery).",
            "The smaller, more remote communities were excluded to ensure that field workers were available to identify and examine as many neonates as possible within 72 hr.",
            "Hospital deliveries.",
            "All consecutive hospital births occurring in the public regional hospital in Quetzaltenango City during the same period as for recruitment of home births were included in the study (n = 1,145).",
            "Subjects were examined by a trained professional nurse stationed in the hospital as soon as routine hospital neonatal procedures permitted and always within the first 24 hr after delivery.",
            "Of these, 188 babies were born to women residing within the six districts covered by the project field workers assessing home deliveries.",
            "The remaining 950 hospital deliveries occurred in other districts of the province.",
            "To help ensure that home-delivered neonates were seen within 3 days after birth, field workers had to reside in their district township.",
            "We excluded stillbirths (2), multiple births (3), children with gross anatomic deformities (2), and other children who died before being measured (12 of the home deliveries; 0 hospital deliveries).",
            "Field workers were trained by E. Boy in all interview and examination procedures.",
            "The interview included questions on the type of fuel used for cooking (wood, coal, electricity, gas) and (if wood or coal) whether this was burned on an open fire or in a stove with a chimney.",
            "We included women reporting that they smoked cigarettes and recorded the number of cigarettes consumed per day.",
            "We assessed socioeconomic status through questions on house construction, particularly the floor material, and also through questions on literacy and marital status.",
            "Questionnaires were checked, and if necessary a repeat visit was made by the field supervisor to rectify errors.",
            "We calculated gestational age using the date of the last menstrual period and compared it to the gestational age estimated postnatally by grading the somatic characteristics of the newborn babies, which were registered on a pictorial format (26).",
            "Birth weight was measured to the nearest 50 g (home deliveries) or 25 g (hospital deliveries).",
            "The neonates were weighed naked and indoors in a warm environment.",
            "When a mother declined to completely undress her baby (8% of cases, all from Almolonga), a shirt and cap of sizes similar to those worn by the baby were weighed, and this weight was subtracted from the total weight recorded for the dressed baby.",
            "The time between birth and the weighing of the child was also recorded.",
            "Maternal anthropometric measurements were read to the nearest 0.1 cm, following standard procedures (27).",
            "For height, a stationary stadiometer was used at the hospital.",
            "For home deliveries a nonextensible measuring tape (180 cm) set on a straight wall (verified with a plumb line perpendicular to level ground) was used.",
            "Maternal calf circumference was measured on the right leg with the woman standing, by sliding the measuring tape around the naked calf until the maximum perimeter was identified at the same point on at least 3 consecutive occasions.",

            "Results",
            "We studied 1,717 mothers and children.",
            "Table 1 shows the number of children of normal and low birth weight (< 2,500 g) for the hospital and home births in the city, each of the six named districts, and the group of all other districts.",
            "The overall percentages of LBW were 18.8% for the hospital birth group and 17.1% for the home birth group.",
            "This difference is nonsignificant (p = 0.4055) even when the city residents are excluded from the analysis (p = 0.2512).",
            "The sample included all hospital births that occurred during the study period, but probably only about 30% of home births from the six districts where these were recruited.",
            "For two districts (Sibilia, Sija), all birth certificates were counted: 30% and 25% of these births, respectively, had been effectively included in the study.",
            "Because about 30% would have taken place in hospital, the study included around 40-50% of all home births.",
            "This relatively low percentage derives from the restriction of recruitment to the larger rural communities.",
            "The implications of this are considered further in Table 1.",
            "Only 14 (0.82%) of the women reported smoking during pregnancy.",
            "Of the 313 women with LBW babies, four (1.28%) smoked during pregnancy.",
            "Of the 1,404 normal weight births, 10 (0.71%) smoked.",
            "This difference was not significant (p = 0.3).",
            "The women who reported smoking have been included in the analysis.",
            "Birth weight by type of fuel.",
            "Approximately one-half of the women cooked with wood in an open fire, one-third with wood stoves equipped with a chimney, and onequarter with the cleaner fuels (Table 2).",
            "In addition, 14 women, most of whom lived in the city, cooked with coal.",
            "In all subsequent analyses, the coal users have been grouped with the wood users according to whether they used coal in an open fire or in a chimney stove.",
            "In this univariate analysis of birth weight, the group mean values decrease progressively from 2,948 g for the clean fuels users to 2,863 g for the chimney stove group and 2,819 g for the open fire group.",
            "A similar trend is observed for LBW prevalence (Table 2).",
            "The differences between mean birth weight for clean fuels and all wood users  combined and between clean fuels and open fire users are highly significant (p < 0.0001).",
            "Although the percent LBW shows the same pattern, the differences are nonsignificant, even though the chi-square for trend approaches significance (p = 0.076).",
            "Other factors associated with low birth weight.",
            "Table 3 shows the distribution of a range of key maternal, social, and economic variables, including the type of fuel, for the LBW (< 2,500 g) group and the normal birth weight group.",
            "The average age of the neonates at the time of measurement was 15.4 \u00b1 10.6 hr for the hospital deliveries and 41.8 \u00b1 20.3 hr for home deliveries (t = 35.5, p < 0.0001).",
            "However, there was no evidence of an association between the time of the measurement and birth weight.",
            "The mean age at measurement was 24.3 \u00b1 19.4 hr for the normal weight neonates and 23.6 \u00b1 17.9 hr for LBW babies (t = 0.596, p = 0.6), and the Pearson correlation coefficient between age at measurement and birth weight was 0.018 (p = 0.4).",
            "Not shown in the table are the associations between birth weight and neonatal age and sex.",
            "Although 20% of female and 16.5% of male newborns had LBW, female sex was only marginally associated with a higher incidence of LBW (chisquare 3.47, p = 0.062).",
            "As expected, the incidence of LBW among prematurely born neonates (37%) was higher than among those born \u2265 37 weeks gestation (13.8%) (chi-square 521.9, p < 0.0001).",
            "The results in Table 3 show that LBW is significantly associated with younger maternal age, smaller maternal calf circumference, and shorter stature (measures of nutritional status), lesser parity, younger gestational age, maternal illiteracy, marital status, dirt floor (economic status proxy), and the lack of vitamin-mineral supplements during the pregnancy.",

            "Table 4 shows the associations between the type of fuel used and the maternal, social, and economic factors that may confound an association between exposure to biofuel air pollution and birth weight.",
            "There are statistically strong associations with all of the factors studied, apart from maternal age, which is more marginal (p = 0.042).",
            "Most of these findings are to be expected-families in the rural areas rely far more on wood fuel, are poorer and less well nourished, and have lower levels of literacy-but the strength of these associations is notable.",
            "The time until examination of the neonate was significantly longer (p < 0.001) for the wood-using group because they usually lived farther from the district centers where the field assistants lived.",
            "However, this factor should not bias the outcome because these data show no evidence of any association between the time of measurement and birth weight (Table 3).",
            "Multivariate analysis.",
            "When fuel type was entered as the three categories presented in Table 2 (clean fuel, chimney stove, open fire), adjusted mean birth weights were 2,834 (gas/electricity), 2,765 (wood/coal stove with chimney), and 2,733 (open fire).",
            "The overall difference was nonsignificant, but the difference between the clean fuel group and the chimney stove group was marginally significant (p = 0.054).",
            "Because this three-level categorization moved fuel type out of the model, and because the difference between the two categories of wood users (chimney stove and open fire) was quite small (32 g), we also performed the analysis using only two categories.",
            "Table 5 shows the explanatory variables giving the best fit.",
            "The model r-squared is 0.097.",
            "Several important factors remained independently associated with LBW, including fuel type, gestational age < 37 weeks (chisquare 52.9, p < 0.0001).",
            "Female sex was marginally associated with LBW (chi-square 3.47, p = 0.06.",
            "The adjusted mean birth weights were 2,772 g for the wood fuel group and 2,835 kg for gas/electricity users, with a mean reduction in birth weight associated with wood use of 63 g (p = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.4-126).",
            "In general the results are consistent with the findings from the univariate analysis: The strongest associations with birth weight are with calf circumference, parity, floor material, and area of residence.",
            "Regarding parity, the only category of previous births significantly different from nulliparity was > 1. Subcategories for nonnulliparous women (0 vs. 1 vs. 2 vs. > 3, for instance) showed no significant association with the risk of LBW.",
            "On the other hand, the somewhat surprising finding that urban dwellers had a lower birth weight than rural dwellers is probably explained by the fact that women living in the city who use the public hospital are the least well off among Quetzaltenango residents.",
            "Discussion",
            "In the province of Quetzaltenango, it is estimated that hospital births account for only about 30% of all births, and about 50% of  births occurring within the city (28).",
            "The predominance of hospital-based births in this study means that it is not representative of the whole community, but this method of recruitment was adopted because of the practical difficulties of identifying and examining home births-especially in the smaller and more remote communities.",
            "The average value of 18% LBW for the sample is higher than the national UNICEF estimate of 14% (1) but in line with what would be expected for this relatively poor province of Guatemala (2).",
            "Although the sample may not be representative of the whole community, the most important issue is whether any significant bias has been introduced into the relationship between fuel type and birth weight.",
            "This could occur if wood-using families with higher birth weights and/or clean-fuel users with lower birth weights have been disproportionately excluded.",
            "We know that wood users are the poorer members of the community, and among hospital births it is the better-off private clinic users (tendency to use clean fuel, lower risk of LBW) that are not included.",
            "Among the home births, it is mainly those from the smaller, more remote communities that are not included.",
            "These women are likely to be poorer, to use an open fire instead of a chimney stove (and hence be more heavily exposed), and to be at higher risk of having an LBW baby.",
            "Therefore, bias from the incomplete sample can be expected to reduce the estimate of any true association between wood fuel and LBW because the rural wood users most at-risk for LBW are those poorer women among whom recruitment was most difficult.",
            "The potential for residual confounding in this study needs to be considered, through limitations of measurement, strong associations between confounders and fuel type, and by omission.",
            "However, the other factors independently associated with LBW in this study (Table 5) are consistent with wellestablished risk factors, and this observation adds weight to the view that these results, though not representative of the whole community, are not seriously biased.",
            "Exposure levels.",
            "Another key issue is whether wood fuel users really did have higher exposure to pollutants, particularly to CO, and whether the level of exposure they experienced was sufficient to impair fetal growth.",
            "Although exposure was not measured directly in the current study, there is fairly substantial evidence from Guatemala (16,(29)(30)(31)(32) and elsewhere (15,17,24,33,34) to answer these questions.",
            "Studies from many parts of the world have shown that women are exposed to very high levels of indoor air pollution from biofuels: Typical 24-hr values for particulate matter (PM) 10 are around 1,000 \u00b5g/m 3 or higher (15,21,24,33).",
            "Ambient 24-hr CO levels are about 5-10 ppm-and 25-50 ppm during use of the fire (16,31,33).",
            "In this part of Guatemala, Naeher et al. reported time-weighted day time concentrations (breakfast, lunch, and dinner times) of 22.9 ppm (SD + 28.1) for open fire users (29).",
            "Studies of COHb levels in people exposed to biofuels have shown levels of 1.5-2.5% (16), 3-4% (34), up to 13% (17).",
            "Given the high ambient (room) levels, these findings for COHb are consistent with an ethnographic study in this part of western Guatemala that found that women spend between 4.6-6.8 hr per day in the house while the fire is lit (32).",
            "The current World Health Organization air quality guidelines recommend exposure to CO of no more than 10 ppm for an 8-hr period and 30 ppm for 1 hr (18), levels that are frequently reached or exceeded in homes burning biomass on open fires.",
            "Are these levels sufficient to cause IUGR?",
            "Because it is now well established that smoking, including environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) (8,9,11,12,35), is associated with LBW, the COHb levels found with active and passive smoking exposure should serve as an adequate indication    35) reported studies of effect of smoking on pregnant women and of breathing increased concentrations of CO on pregnant rabbits.",
            "Women who smoke had a mean COHb of 1.92% and mean birth weight 235 g less than those of a nonsmoking group.",
            "Rabbits breathing 90 ppm CO produced a COHb of 8-9% and a reduction in mean birth weight of 11%.",
            "In contrast, a study of similar CO exposure in rats, where 90 ppm produced COHb of 8.8%, found no reduction in birth weight (36).",
            "In the same study, rats breathing reduced oxygen (13%) did have lower birth weights, an effect thought to be caused by reduced food consumption.",
            "In summary, although the categorization of fuel type used in this study and, by assumption, the levels of exposure were crude, it is likely to discriminate reasonably well.",
            "There is good evidence that the woodfuel users (especially those with open fires) are exposed to hazardous levels of CO and other pollutants and that these levels are sufficient to cause IUGR.",
            "This assumes that it is CO exposure (or some other biomass smoke constituent) rather than nicotine that is the predominant mechanism by which cigarette smoking causes LBW.",
            "Exposure is in reality very complex and determined by the type and condition of the of wood (or other biofuel), the combustion device (open fire, stove of varying quality and state of repair), the time that women spend in the kitchen, and the contamination levels at or from adjacent homes of relatives and friends.",
            "Future studies of this and related health outcomes should, if resources permit, include direct measurement of exposure.",
            "Studies of ambient air pollution and birthweight.",
            "We are not aware of any other human population studies of exposure to biofuel and birth weight, but several studies published recently have reported effects of ambient air pollutants on birth weight (38)(39)(40).",
            "Ritz et al. (37) studied over 125,000 births in Los Angeles and reported an adjusted odds ratio for LBW with thirdtrimester exposure to CO of > 5.5 ppm (3month average) of 1.22 (1.03-1.44).",
            "In the study from China (38), the relationship between maternal exposure to ambient urban air pollution during pregnancy and birth weight was studied in a well-defined cohort between 1988 and 1991.",
            "After controlling for gestational age, residence, maternal age, year of birth, and sex of infant, the authors found a significant relationship between birth weight and maternal exposure to sulfur dioxide and total suspended particles (TSP) during the third trimester of pregnancy.",
            "The estimated reduction in birth weight was 7.3 g and 6.9 g for each 100 \u00b5g/m 3 increase in SO 2 and TSP, respectively.",
            "Data on CO levels were not reported.",
            "In an ecologic study of 45 districts in the Czech Republic, Bobak et al. (39) reported an adjusted odds ratio for LBW of 1.10 (1.01-1.20) for an increase of 50 \u00b5g/m 3 in SO 2 .",
            "In this analysis, effects of TSP and NO x were nonsignificant, and CO was not studied.",
            "Two further recent time-series studies from the Czech Republic have reported associations between IUGR and fine particulates (40) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (41), both of which are prominent components of wood smoke.",
            "In the former study, an adjusted odds ratio for IUGR for each 20 \u00b5g/m 3 increase in PM 10 exposure in the first gestational month of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.15-1.96) was reported.",
            "In the latter study, exposure to PAHs in early pregnancy (first gestational month) produced an incremental adjusted odds ratio for IUGR of 1.22 (1.07-1.39) for each 10 ng increase in PAHs.",
            "Magnitude of effect.",
            "This study has shown that after adjustment for relevant confounding variables, women using wood fuel had children with a mean birth weight some 63 g (0.4-126) less than that for women using cleaner fuels.",
            "Allowing for the classification error introduced by the relatively crude categorization of exposure, this effect could be expected to be greater among women consistently exposed to indoor biofuel pollution from poorly ventilated open fires.",
            "Although errors introduced by variations in setting, measurement, type of exposure and other factors, as well as random error (as reflected in the wide confidence interval and marginal significance), make it unwise to overinterpret the actual magnitude of the effect on birth weight, there is nevertheless a degree of consistency between this study and those on active smoking, passive smoking, and urban air pollution.",
            "Active smoking is associated with effects of up to 200 g, ETS around 30-40 g.",
            "A study from South India reported a reduction of 63 g associated with ETS exposure among nonsmoking women, although it did not mention cook smoke or other sources of air pollution (42).",
            "The effect seen in the Chinese study would yield a reduction in birth weight of around 70 g for the 24-hr mean levels of 1,000 \u00b5g/m 3 reported for open fire homes in western Guatemala (the equivalent PM 10 level would be a little lower than TSP in the case of indoor biofuel pollution) (38).",
            "This calculation, however, assumes a linear relationship somewhat beyond the data range for which the maximum TSP was 618 \u00b5g/m 3 .",
            "The consistency of this study with those of smoking, ETS, and ambient pollution suggests that this association with birth weight is indeed significant, as does the plausibility of a mechanism mediated through CO exposure and COHb (although this does not exclude other potential contributing mechanisms).",
            "The effect was independent of the confounding factors studied, albeit marginally, although the problem of dealing with confounding factors in observational studies on health effects of environmental risk factors such as indoor air pollution is recognized (43).",
            "Some evidence of a dose-response relationship was found, p = 0.08 (Table 2), although this was not apparent after adjustment.",
            "There should be no concern about the temporal relationship because we can safely assume that the exposure to wood smoke was present during the pregnancy among those reporting that they cooked with wood.",
            "It is possible that some women using wood during most of pregnancy changed later to a cleaner fuel and reported this as their main fuel during pregnancy, but this bias would tend to underestimate the true effect.",
            "There is also some supporting evidence from animal studies of exposure to tobacco smoke.",
            "Attributable risk of indoor air pollution exposure.",
            "Overall, the evidence suggests that there may be an association between exposure to biofuel pollution and reduced birth weight, although this does need confirmation.",
            "Most households in developing countries still rely on biofuels for their daily cooking and heating needs; this rises to more than 80% in rural areas of some of the world's poorest countries (23).",
            "Women, particularly during their childbearing years, carry by far the greatest burden of cooking duties and exposure to indoor air pollution.",
            "This combination of high levels of CO and other pollutants, exposure of very large numbers of pregnant women over many hours each day, and high baseline levels of LBW implies that the global attributable risk for LBW-associated mortality and morbidity could be very substantial.",
            "Although the mean reduction in birth weight resulting from this exposure may not be as great as that seen with active smoking, the importance of shifting the distribution by even a small amount in a population with a high prevalence of LBW should perhaps not be underestimated (44).",

            "Relief or disappearance of symptoms during weekends and vacations were recorded.",
            "The 91 fuel-filling attendants controlled jet fuel by spot samples and visual inspection of the outlet from the bottom of the tanks.",
            "They filled up tank trucks, jet planes, and helicopters with jet fuel.",
            "No gloves or protective respirators or protective clothing was used.",
            "The median daily duration of exposure to jet fuel was 4 (range 0.5-8) h.",
            "The employed jet fuel is a complex mixture of various hydrocarbons, physically characterized by a vapor pressure of 12-21 kPa, a distillation point of 170-350\u00b0C (most distilled at 270\u00b0C), and a freezing point of -58\u00b0C.",
            "Chemically, the jet fuel contains about 17-20 vol07o aromatics (maximum 25 %) and 1-5 % oleofines, and it has a total sulfur content of 0.4 070.",
            "Sixty-nine samples from the breathing zone of 12 randomly chosen fuel-filling attendants were collected on charcoal tubes for two to four workdays during the period when the first liver test was performed.",
            "The tubes were desorbed with dimethylformamide and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography with a Hewlett-Packard HP 5831 A equiped with a flame ionization detector (7671 A) and with 2-ethoxyethanol as the internal standard (15).",
            "Spot samples collected during the exposure and samples collected during several hours of work were obtained in order to determine the variation in exposure and the average daily exposure level.",
            "The median air concentration of jet fuel was 31 (quartiles 9-82, range 1-1 020) mg/m\", Four samples were above 700 mg/m\", two of which were collected during 3 h of work indoors.",
            "The other two measurements were collected in open air during 10-20 min of exposure.",
            "On the fourth or the fifth workday of one of the last weeksbefore summer vacation antipyrine clearance o during work o during vacation was measured and a venous blood sample was drawn for the estimation of serum aspartate aminotransferase and serum alkaline phosphatase by routine laboratory methods (autoanalyses).",
            "The procedure was repeated on one of the last days of a two-to four-week summer vacation.",
            "For antipyrine clearance determination antipyrine (1 g) dissolved in water was taken orally and saliva was collected 24 h later by the subjects according to written instructions.",

            "The simplified antipyrine clearance (ClAP) was calculated as ClAP = ([In(D/Vd)lnc.l/t] .",
            "V d , where D is dose; Vd is the volume of distribution assumed based on the recorded age, sex, body weight, and height of each person; and c t is the concentration of antipyrine at sampling time t (4).",
            "Differences within and between the groups were compared by a Wilcoxon's rank sum test for paired and nonpaired data, respectively.",
            "For the evaluation of the antipyrine data a t-test was used .",
            "A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
            "Results",
            "p<O.02",
            "The salivar y clearance of antip yrine was 18 0J0 higher in the fuel-filling attendants (p < 0.001) during exposure to jet fuel as compared to the measurement made after two to four weeks free from exposure (figure 1).",
            "The enhanced clearance in the group of office workers, amounting to 11 070, was also stati stically significant (p < 0.02) (figure 1).",
            "The referents were employed at two different air force bases, and the mean antipyrine clearance was only increased in one of the group s [72.4 (SD 21.8) ml/min versus 57.4 (SD 12.1) ml/min , N = 24 (p < 0.001), and 54.8 (SD 20.6) versus 55.1 (SD 31.1) ml/min, N = 23 (p > 0.3)].",
            "Although the antipyrine clearance was 9 0J0 higher in the fuel-filling attendants than in the office workers in the first measurement, this difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance (p < 0.1).",
            "The duration of daily exposure to jet fuel and the duration of employment with jet fuel did not correlate significantly either with antipyrine clearance or with the relative change in antip yrine clearance from the first to the second measurement.",
            "In both measurements the smokers had a significantly (on the average 3 I 0J0 ) higher antipyrine clearance than the nonsmokers in both groups (p > 0.01) (figure 2).",
            "No difference in serum aspartate aminotransferase and serum alkaline phosphatase was found either between or within the group s (p > 0.2) (table 1).",
            "The fuel-filling attendants were younger (median 34 years, range 21-59 years) than the office worke rs (median 44 years, range 19-66 years) (p < 0.01), but there was no difference in duration of employment in the air force (p > 0.3).",
            "No significant difference between the groups was found between the average daily consump-  than the of fice workers.",
            "Discussion",
            "Our study shows that the fuel-filling attendants with daily exposure to jet fuel had a higher antipyrine clear-ance before two to four weeks of vacation than after.",
            "No changes in the host factors with known impact on antipyrine clearance were recorded within the groups between the two measurements.",
            "We did not record or control dietary factors.",
            "However, it is difficult to imagine that the fuel-filling attendants would reduce their intake of food with inducing properties during vacation.",
            "Intuitively, it is more likely that they would increase their consumption of inducing food items, such as charcoal broiled meat, during a summer vacation .",
            "Accordingly, our data indicate that jet fuel is an inducer of microsomal enzyme activity in man .",
            "Jet fuel is a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydro carbons closely related to white spirit and gasoline, both of which are inducers of microsomal enzyme ac-tivity in rats (9,11).",
            "In 19 gas station attendants exposed to gasoline during conditions of work resembling those of our fuel-filling attendants, a significantly lower antipyrine half-time was found in comparison to that of 19 referents from a university staff and students.",
            "The study was weakened by its cross-sectional design and lack of information about host factors with known impact on antipyrine clearance (9).",
            "While experiments with rats indicate that exposure by inhalation to the aromatic hydrocarbons toluene, styrene, and xylene are inducers of microsomal enzyme activity (8, 17> 21), this occurrence has not been confirmed in man (3).",
            "However, polyaromatic hydrocarbons such as polychlorinated biphenyls and various pesticides are well established inducers of antipyrine (1,13) and phenylbutazone metabolism (19).",
            "Also the anesthetic agent halothane may be an inducer of antipyrine metabolism (5,6).",
            "Surprisingly, antipyrine clearance was also significantly increased in our office workers during work in comparison to the measurement made at the end of their summer vacation .",
            "The office workers were equally distributed between two air force bases.",
            "At one base (air base I) (N = 24) the antipyrine clearance was greater by 26 % (p < 0.001), while it was almost unchanged (-1 %) in the other group (air base II) (N = 23).",
            "Since our previous studies with a similar design and methods of analyses have shown an unchanged antipyrine clearance in reference groups (2,3,5), the results of the present study strongly indicate a possible inducing factor in the work environment of air base I.",
            "One of these may be photoprinting, which carries a risk of exposure to chemicals such as carbon black consisting of polyaromatic hydrocarbons with potential inducing properties (14).",
            "However, an inquiry among the two groups of office workers showed that at air base I 15 of the 25 employees were daily employed in photoprinting in contrast to 18 of 23 employees at air base II.",
            "Accordingly, the result of the inquiry does not lend support to the hypothesis of photoprinting as the inducing factor in the office work environment.",
            "Despite a careful investigation of both air base offices it was not possible to reveal any differences in the work environment.",
            "The well-established strong inducing capacity of cigarette smoke (10,23) was confirmed in our study.",
            "The antipyrine clearance of both the smokers and nonsmokers was induced to about the same extent during exposure to jet fuel (figure 2), a result which indicates that one inducing factor is added to the other by simple addition.",
            "This simple rule does not always apply, however.",
            "During concomitant exposure to inducing drugs the result may be potentiating (16), additive (2), or less than additive (18).",
            "We did not find any change in the conventional clinical chemistry indices of toxic liver injury (serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase).",
            "Our results are in agreement with most previous studies in which occu-436 pational chemicals alter antipyrine clearance but leave the transaminase and alkaline phosphatase unchanged (1,3).",
            "Hence, the recorded change in microsomal enzyme activity is hardly an expression of a harmful toxic effect on the liver, but it may lead to altered metabolism of other microsomally metabolized drugs carrying a risk of therapeutic failure or toxicity.",
            "Clinically important therapeutic failure or toxicity of drugs associated with occupational exposure to chemicals has hitherto only been reported in a few case histories (12,24).",
            "However, the possible impact of microsomal enzyme induction on health on a long-term scale is not known.",
            "We conclude that occupational exposure to jet fuel at concentrations high enough to cause mucous membrane irritation enhances the clearance of antipyrine.",
            "Our study also indicated an unknown inducing factor in the work environment of one of the reference groups of office workers.",

            "British Journal of Cancer",
            "Br J Cancer",
            "In a case-control study from Italy and Switzerland with 404 oesophageal cancer cases and 1070 hospital controls, the risk of oesophageal cancer declined with time since cessation of smoking or drinking, and was significantly reduced (odds ratio = 0.11) 10 or more years after cessation of both habits.",
            "While the risk of oesophageal cancer is lower in ex-smokers than in current smokers, and declines steeply with time since stopping smoking (Brown et al, 1988;Yu et al, 1988, La Vecchia et al, 1990;Castellsagu\u00e9 et al, 1999), little is known on the time-risk relation of stopping alcohol drinking on oesophageal carcinogenesis.",
            "In a study conducted in Hong Kong (Cheng et al, 1995) the relative risk (RR) of former drinkers who had stopped for less than 5 years was higher than that of current drinkers, and was significantly below that of current drinkers only 15 or more years after stopping.",
            "In a pooled analysis from South America of five studies conducted in high-risk areas (Castellsagu\u00e9 et al, 1999), the RR declined steadily with stopping smoking and drinking, but the decrease in risk was significant only 10 years or more after stopping drinking.",
            "In a French study of oesophageal cancer (Launoy et al, 1997) the RR declined 5 or more years after stopping smoking, but no clear pattern of risk was observed after stopping drinking.",
            "A similar pattern of risk, with some decline in risk for heavy drinkers only 10 or more years after cessation, and a steeper fall after stopping smoking, was observed in a study of oral and pharyngeal cancer conducted in the same areas of the present investigation (La Vecchia et al, 1999;Franceschi et al, 2000).",
            "To evaluate the pattern of risk after stopping smoking and drinking on oesophageal carcinogenesis, we analysed data from a multicentre case-control study conducted in Italy and Switzerland.",
            "SUBJECTS AND METHODS",
            "Data of the present analysis derive from two case-control studies of oesophageal cancer conducted between 1992 and 1999 in northern Italy and in the Swiss Canton of Vaud, whose general design has already been described (Bosetti et al, 2000;Levi et al, 2000).",
            "Briefly, cases were subjects admitted to the major teaching and general hospitals in the areas under study with newly-diagnosed, histologically confirmed squamous cell cancer of the oesophagus.",
            "A total of 404 subjects (356 men and 48 women) were included, whose median age was 60 years (range, 34-77).",
            "Controls were subjects admitted to the same hospitals as the cases for a wide spectrum of acute, non-neoplastic conditions excluding those related to smoking or alcohol consumption.",
            "The control group comprised a total of 1070 subjects, 878 men and 192 women, whose median age was 60 years (range 32-77 years).",
            "Twenty-four percent of the controls were admitted for traumas, 27% for other non-traumatic orthopaedic conditions, 31% for acute surgical conditions, and 18% for miscellaneous other illnesses, including eye, nose, ear, skin or dental disorders.",
            "In both studies a structured questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers to cases and controls during their hospital stay, including information on tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking.",
            "The section on smoking included questions on smoking status (never, current or ex-smokers), daily number of cigarettes/cigars smoked, age at starting, duration of the habit and, for ex-smokers, age at smoking cessation.",
            "Information on alcohol consumption included the average number of days per week each type of alcoholic beverage (wine, beer and spirits) was consumed, and the average number of drinks per day, and, for ex-drinkers, age at drinking cessation.",
            "Ex-drinkers and ex-smokers were subjects who had abstained from any type of drinking or smoking for at least 12 months.",
            "Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), were estimated using unconditional multiple logistic regression models (Breslow and Day, 1980), including terms for age, sex, study centre, years of education, and amount of alcohol and tobacco consumption.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Table 1 gives the distribution of the 404 squamous cell oesophageal cancer cases and the 1070 control subjects, according to smoking and drinking status, and time since cessation of these habits.",
            "A total of 124 cases were ex-smokers, and 49 were exdrinkers.",
            "Compared to current smokers, the OR for all ex-smokers combined was 0.46 (0.34-0.67).",
            "The ORs for ex-smokers were above unity until 5 years since smoking cessation, and declined to 0.58 for 6-9 years, and to 0.31 for 10 years or more after cessation, approaching that of never-smokers (OR = 0.23)",
            "The inverse trend in risk with time since smoking cessation was significant (P < 0.0001).",
            "The risk-reduction according to time since alcohol drinking cessation was less consistent.",
            "The ORs for ex-drinkers, as compared to current drinkers, were 0.85 for 1-5 years since drinking cessation, 1.72 for 6-14 years, and 0.53 for 15 or more years since stopping.",
            "Thus, only after 15 years since drinking cessation did the OR for ex-drinkers approach that of neverdrinkers (OR = 0.31).",
            "The combined effect of stopping either tobacco smoking or alcohol drinking or both, in relation to time since cessation of each habit, is shown in Table 2.",
            "As compared to subjects currently both smoking and drinking, the risk of oesophageal cancer decreased with time since smoking cessation across strata of time since drinking cessation.",
            "In contrast, a reduced risk of oesophageal cancer in relation to time since drinking cessation was observed only 10 or more years after drinking cessation, except for long term ex-smokers.",
            "The OR for having stopped drinking for 10 or more years, adjusted for time since smoking cessation, was 0.37 (95% CI 0.14-0.99) and the OR was more strongly and significantly reduced 10 or more years since cessation of both habits (OR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.90).",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "The present study adds further evidence for the well-known effect of tobacco smoking cessation on reducing oesophageal cancer risk (Brown et al, 1988;Yu et al, 1988, La Vecchia et al, 1990;Castellsagu\u00e9 et al, 1999), and it also indicates that stopping alcohol drinking leads to a reduced oesophageal cancer risk after 10 or more years, when allowance is made for time since stopping smoking.",
            "It also provides convincing evidence that stopping consumption of both alcohol and tobacco leads to a substantial reduction of oesophageal cancer risk.",
            "After 10 or more years since stopping both habits the RR is only about one tenth of that of current smokers and drinkers.",
            "The pattern of risk after stopping drinking does not seem to be linear, and, after allowance for time since smoking cessation, the RR for ex-drinkers was similar or above that of current drinkers for at least 10 years since stopping.",
            "This may be due to some characteristics of people who have recently stopped drinking.",
            "Most former drinkers were, in fact, heavy drinkers and stopping drinking may therefore, have been influenced by health-related conditions.",
            "From a biological viewpoint, the persistence of an excess risk several years after stopping drinking indicates that alcohol is probably not a late-stage carcinogen (Day and Brown, 1980) in this disease, as previously observed for oral and pharyngeal cancers (Franceschi et al, 2000).",
            "In this study information on smoking and alcohol was satisfactorily reproducible (D'Avanzo et al, 1996) and valid (Ferraroni et al, 1996), but no information was available on reliability of data on time since stopping habits.",
            "The hospital setting is likely, however, to ensure a reasonable comparability of information collected (Breslow and Day, 1980).",
            "With reference to confounding, careful allowance was made for tobacco and alcohol, and their related time factors.",
            "In these southern European populations about 60% of oesophageal cancer cases could be attributed, after reciprocal allowance in multivariate analysis, to tobacco smoking, 80% to alcohol drinking, and 88% to the combination of the two habits 690 C Bosetti et al British Journal of Cancer (2000) 83( 5), 689-691 \u00a9 2000 Cancer Research Campaign (Bruzzi et al, 1985).",
            "Stopping alcohol drinking, and particularly cessation of smoking, could therefore an appreciable impact in reducing oesophageal cancer risk, and therefore represent obvious priorities for prevention and public-health purposes.",

            "Our results provide direct evidence for the participation of MPO \u2013 one of the key-orchestrators of inflammatory response \u2013 in the in vivo pulmonary oxidative biodegradation of SWCNT and suggest new ways to control the biopersistence of nanomaterials through genetic or pharmacological manipulations.",
            "Introduction",
            "Biopersistence of carbon nanotubes (CNT) - resulting from their inherent durability is one the major stumbling blocks on the way of their broad biomedical applications.",
            "This is because engineered CNT represent a possible health risk due to their ability to cause pulmonary inflammation, severe oxidative stress and early onset fibrosis in animals.",
            "They also exert genotoxic effects possibly associated with carcinogenesis (e.g., induction of mesotheliomas).",
            "These health concerns have been associated \u2013 to a large extent \u2013 with the reported long \u201clife-span\u201d of SWCNT in the lung thus necessitating exploration of possible metabolic pathways leading to their biodegradation.",
            "Although different types of chemical oxidative cutting of CNT - lengthwise and shortening \u2013 have been described, they require harsh oxidants (e.g., sulphuric acid plus H2O2 or KMnO4).",
            "Recently, we reported that reactive intermediates of horseradish peroxidase are effective in enzymatic oxidative biodegradation of CNT and graphene oxide.",
            "Moreover, myeloperoxidase (MPO), an abundant enzyme of inflammatory cells (neutrophils), - involved in the principal defense mechanisms of innate immunity -was also effective in oxidative biodegradation of CNT in biochemical models and in cells yielding the products that did not cause pulmonary inflammation in mice.",
            "However, the relevance of this mechanism for CNT biodegradation in vivo was lacking.",
            "Here, we employed MPO knockout B6.129X1-MPO (MPO k/o) vs wild-type C57Bl/6 mice (w/t) and demonstrated that clearance and oxidation of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in the lungs after their pharyngeal aspiration was markedly less effective whereas inflammatory response was more robust in the former than in the latter.",
            "Our results provide direct evidence for the participation of MPO in pulmonary biodegradation of SWCNT in vivo.",
            "Based on these data, new genetic and pharmacological approaches can be developed to regulate the biopersistence of nanomaterials in tissues.",
            "Results and Discussion",
            "Pulmonary inflammatory responses in w/t and MPO k/o mice exposed to SWCNT",
            "Upon pharyngeal aspiration, SWCNT elicited typical inflammatory responses in w/t and MPO k/o mice documented by increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and MCP-1) 1 day after the exposure (Fig. 1a, b, c).",
            "BAL cytology indicated a robust and early (day 1) accumulation of neutrophils - slightly weaker in MPO k/o mice vs w/t animals (Fig. 1d), followed by a sequential appearance of macrophages in both groups of animals (with a peak at day 7) (data not shown).",
            "At day 28 post exposure, the amounts of PMN in BAL fluid from exposed MPO k/o mice and w/t mice are not different from those in the respective control groups of animals (Fig. 1d).",
            "In BAL, phagocytized SWCNT were detected inside PMNs and macrophages (Fig. 1e).",
            "Because of the enrichment of PMNs with MPO, we compared the SWCNT content in these cells.",
            "An \u223c10 times greater number of PMNs from MPO k/o mice had SWCNT inclusions than those from w/t animals (Fig. 1f), in agreement with the lack of MPO-driven biodegradation in MPO k/o mice.",
            "Assessments of fibrosis by measurements of collagen deposition on day 28 post-exposure revealed its significantly higher amounts in the lungs of MPO k/o mice compared to w/t animals (Fig. 2a).",
            "A stronger fibrogenic response in k/o vs w/t mice was also evident from quantitative morphometry of the thickness of fibrous collagen in the alveolar connective tissue (Fig. 2b).",
            "An increase of the thickness was observed already at day 1 post-exposure and progressed further by day 28 compared with air control groups.",
            "A markedly higher collagen content of the alveolar wall was detected in the lung of MPO-deficient mice compared to w/t animals (Fig. 2b).",
            "Assessment of SWCNT aggregates in the lung of w/t and MPO k/o mice",
            "To evaluate the content of SWCNT and their aggregates we employed quantitative imaging by illuminating lung sections with the light in the spectral range of 750\u2013840 nm selectively absorbed by SWCNT.",
            "In the images presented in Fig. 3a, the lung tissue is shown in red, the SWCNT image was inverted such that the nanotubes look bright and pseudocolored in green.",
            "The volume occupied by SWCNT at day 1 post-exposure (\u223c07\u20131.0% of the total lung volume) markedly decreased by day 28 (to 0.02\u20130.03%).",
            "Elimination of SWCNT from the lung of w/t mice was almost 2 times more effective than in MPO k/o animals (Fig. 3b).",
            "Additionally, we employed another approach for collecting SWCNT images: we scanned unstained paraffin embedded lung sections using INCell Analyser 1000 high content screening; optically detectable SWCNT aggregates were counted in each field throughout the lung sections.",
            "The content of SWCNT aggregates in each field on day 1 post-exposure was approximately the same in both groups of mice but markedly decreased by day 28 after exposure (Fig. 3c).",
            "Assuming the content of aggregates on day 1 in both groups as 100%, the relative content of SWCNT aggregates dropped to <20% in w/t samples but remained at the level of >60% in the MPO k/o lung sections \u2013 a more than 3-fold difference.",
            "To obtain further evidence for \u201ccutting\u201d of SWCNT by MPO, we performed TEM analysis of the lung samples after solubilization of the tissue and evaluated the size distribution of SWCNT and their aggregates (Fig. 4).",
            "On day 1 after exposure, \u223c35\u201340% of SWCNT were represented by large aggregates of >0.75 \u00b5m whereas 20\u201325% of aggregates were >0.5 \u00b5m and 35\u201340% had the size range from 0.5\u20130.75 \u00b5m in w/t and k/o animals.",
            "This distribution had changed markedly at day 28 after exposure in favour of small aggregates.",
            "The \u201ccutting\u201d pattern was different in w/t and k/o animals: a \u223c2-fold increase for aggregates <0.5 \u00b5m, mostly at the expense of the decreased amount of large aggregates, was observed in the lungs of w/t mice whereas these changes in the SWCNT size distribution were much less pronounced in MPO k/o mice (Fig. 4b, c).",
            "This suggests that MPO was involved in the cutting of SWCNT into smaller fragments - in accord with our previous in vitro experiments.",
            "Raman spectroscopic evaluation of defects in SWCNT in the lungs of w/t and MPO k/o mice",
            "MPO-driven biodegradation occurs via oxidative modification of SWCNT with the appearance of characteristic defects detectable by Raman spectroscopy.",
            "Therefore, we utilized two different Raman spectroscopic techniques to determine whether these oxidation-associated defects could be detected in the samples of the lung from exposed mice.",
            "First, we performed Raman spectroscopy after solubilization of the lung tissue.",
            "To assess oxidative biodegradation of SWCNT, the D-band/G-band ratios were calculated, whereby an increase in the ratio indicates oxidative degradation.",
            "Typical Raman spectra documenting the signals from non-oxidized SWCNT with a pronounced G band and a very weak D-band were recorded on day 1 post-exposure resulting in low D-band/G-band ratios for both w/t and MPO k/o animals (Fig. 5a).",
            "On day 28 post-exposure, the D-band/G-band ratio remained almost unchanged for the samples from k/o animals whereas an \u223c2-fold increase was found in the lungs of w/t mice.",
            "Next, we obtained Raman maps of ten different areas that contained SWCNT within each lung tissue section.",
            "Fig. 5b shows examples of bright-field images of samples from w/t and MPO k/o mice, respectively, at day 1 post-exposure, with a red box indicating the area where the Raman maps were acquired; (5c, 1\u20134) shows typical Raman maps obtained based on the clusters (5c, 5\u20138) per pixel.",
            "These bright-field images and Raman maps were generated for every sample on days 1 and 28 after the SWCNT exposure.",
            "SWCNT degradation increased over time.",
            "Importantly, 28 days post exposure there was a significant difference (p\u200a=\u200a0.0277) between the D-band/G-band ratios of the SWCNT indicative of a markedly higher SWCNT degradation in w/t mice than in MPO k/o animals (Fig. 5d).",
            "While the difference in clearance of SWCNT from the lungs of w/t and MPO k/o mice was significant, it is also obvious that additional, yet to be identified, factors contribute to biodegradation and elimination of SWCNT.",
            "Indeed, SWCNT clearance occurred, although at a lower rate, in MPO k/o animals.",
            "Contribution of other heme-peroxidases to the clearance of SWCNT is quite possible.",
            "Degradation of SWCNT by MPO during the peroxidase cycle whereby the reaction with H2O2 yields a reactive intermediate, compound I, which oxidizes chloride by a single 2-electron transfer to produce the hypochlorous acid (HOCl).",
            "Both oxidants \u2013 reactive MPO intermediates and hypochlorous acid \u2013 are involved in the oxidative degradation of nanotubes due to the breakage of C-C and C-H bonds.",
            "Reactive intermediates can be also generated by other heme-peroxidases such as eosinophil peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, thyroid peroxidase as well as by hemoproteins with peroxidase activity (hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochromes P450).",
            "In fact, the ability of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and lactoperoxidase to oxidatively biodegrade SWCNT in vitro has been documented.",
            "While it is possible that alternative peroxidase pathways may participate in pulmonary biodegradation of SWCNT the results of the current study - demonstrating a significantly lower clearance of SWCNT from the lungs of MPO k/o mice vs w/t animals - are supportive of the essential role of MPO in this process.",
            "While this study utilized SWCNT, it is highly likely that multi-walled carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphene and other carbonaceous particles may also undergo MPO-catalyzed modifications and degradation.",
            "In contrast to in vitro incubation systems, non-covalent coating of SWCNT with proteins and lipids in vivo  occurring during their interactions with components of biofluids will inevitably affect recognition patterns and metabolic pathways of the particles.",
            "Our recent studies indicate that in the lung, SWCNT are effectively coated with the major surfactant lipids and proteins.",
            "Hence, the nature of the nanomaterial \u201ccoronation\u201d by proteins and/or lipids may impact on the degree of recognition and biodegradation by immune-competent cells.",
            "The major bactericidal function of MPO via oxidative attack on pathogens has been well characterized.",
            "The ability of MPO to oxidatively modify organic xenobiotics and drugs has been also documented.",
            "Here, we describe a hitherto unknown role of MPO in the body to oxidatively biodegrade carbonaceous particles, specifically SWCNT.",
            "One can presume that this is one of the essential and very ancient catalytic roles of the enzyme aimed at oxidative degradation and clearance of different types of carbonaceous materials to which animals and humanoids have been exposed from primordial times \u2013 such as particles generated by intentional (e.g., during cooking of food or technological high temperature processing of metals and other materials) or unintentional (forest fires, volcano eruptions) exposures.",
            "With the advent of nanotechnologies, health concerns prompted exploration of endogenous metabolic pathways competent in clearance of these notoriously biopersistent, inflammogenic and genotoxic, hence potentially high risk materials, including SWCNT.",
            "The current work demonstrates that MPO is involved in SWCNT degradation in vivo thus offering new opportunities for controlled regulation of SWNT's \u201clife-span\u201d in tissues and circulation.",

            "SWCNT (CNI Inc., Houston, TX) produced by the high pressure CO disproportionation process (HiPco) technique employing CO in a continuous-flow gas phase as the carbon feedstock and Fe(CO)5 as the iron-containing catalyst precursor, and purified by acid treatment to remove metal contaminates were used in the study.",

            "Two color images were collected from mounted sections of lung using a Hamamatsu Orca ER cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) on a Nikon 90i upright microscope (Melville, NY), equipped with a high speed linear encoded xy stage (Prior Scientific, Rockland, MA), and fluorescence imaging and bright field imaging capabilities.",
            "The motorized stage coupled with Elements software (Nikon NIS, Melville, NY) allows collection of large area images which consist of multiple stitched and aligned frames.",
            "Each image was a 10\u00d710 image field at 10\u00d7 magnification.",
            "To collect the image of the lung tissue the autofluorescent signal from the paraffin embedment was detected using 530 nm excitation and 560\u2013600 nm emission.",
            "To visualize nanotubes sections were illuminated with white light and blocking filter (750\u2013840 nm transmission) was placed between the specimen and the camera.",
            "In this conditions nanotubes selectively absorbing light in the range 750\u2013800 nm were seen as black spots.",
            "For image processing, the area of the lung in the section profile was used to outline the lung, and the autofluorescent signal was used to threshold and generate tissue area measurements in each section.",
            "The same section profile region was overlaid on the nanotube image and a dark objects thresholded to generate an area measurement of the nanotubes within the lung.",
            "In the final images shown in Fig. 3a the lung tissue is shown in red, the tube image was inverted (such that the tubes are now bright) and pseudocolored green.",

            "Unstained paraffin embedded lung tissue sections from MPO k/o and w/t mice were scanned using the IN Cell Analyser 1000 high content screening and analysis system to distinguish between the organic tissue and the inorganic SWCNT (under bright field imaging settings).",

            "all nonexposed subjects had urinary ETU levels below the limit of detection.",
            "The fact that one-third of the applicators and one- half of the landowners had urinary ETU levels below the limit of detection can be explained by 1) a lack of sensitivity of the assay to detect low ETU levels, even when there was exposure; 2) differences in metab- olism of EDBCs to ETU between subjects; and 3) different work practices and cleanup practices between subjects.",
            "Landowners generally had less contact with the pesti- cides, and it is perhaps not surprising that half had urinary ETU below the limit of detection.",
            "Among the applicators, division of the population by number of baths per week showed that those who bathed daily had a higher proportion of urinary ETU samples below the limit of detection, and had significantly lower mean urinary ETU, than those who bathed less often (data not shown).",
            "Another possible reason for urinary data below the limit of detection is misclas- sification; the urine collection was not observed directly and some samples could have been for the wrong person.",
            "Although all the thyroid hormone data were within normal range, after age-adjustment the TSH level was significantly increased in the applicators compared to the nonexposed subjects (and nonsignificantly increased among the landowners, suggesting a dose response).",
            "In our data, age was nega- tively correlated with TSH and acted as a negative confounder.",
            "Several reports in the literature indicate that TSH levels decrease with age in healthy populations (21,22), but other studies have not shown such an effect (23).",
            "The exposure effect for applicators versus nonexposed controls for TSH was also apparent without age adjustment (p = 0.07) when the data were restricted to younger subjects (<30 years of age, 87% of applicators and controls).",
            "Because T4 levels were not decreased among the exposed compared to the nonex- posed, TSH may be a more sensitive indica- tor of an effect on the thyroid than T4 levels (20).",
            "Most of these workers had been exposed to EBDCs and ETU for several weeks or months at the time of testing; homeostasis with normal T4 but elevated TSH might be expected after several weeks of exposure (24).",
            "The effect on TSH is con- sistent with animal data (1).",
            "In the one study of ETU-production workers with presumed high exposure, the five most highly exposed mixers had significantly decreased T4 and one had abnormally high TSH with dinical signs of premyxedema (3).",
            "We did not observe any dinical signs of hypothyroidism in our study population, but we performed no clinical exams.",
            "If hypothyroidism does occur in these workers, it is possible that affected subjects could not continue in this type of relatively strenuous work.",
            "Our data on genotoxic outcomes indicate that the applicators had significantly increased SCEs, with or without adjustment for age and smoking.",
            "Chromosome translo- cations were significantly elevated for both applicators and owners (p<0.001) before age adjustment, compared to nonexposed sub- jects.",
            "However, age acted as a positive con- founder in these data; after age adjustment, the exposure effect was diminished, although it was still present for applicators versus nonexposed controls (p = 0.05).",
            "When analyses were restricted to the subset of reciprocal translocations, the increase for applicators failed to reach conventional statistical significance after age adjustment (p = 0.24).",
            "In the age-adjusted data, again the landowners showed less pronounced elevations than applicators, suggesting a possible dose response.",
            "Reciprocal translocations are thought to be more stable than nonrecipro- cal translocations (13), and the somewhat more pronounced effect seen for all translo- cations (including nonreciprocals) may reflect the effects of more recent exposure.",

            "The increased SCEs indicate that expo- sure is affecting the genome, but it is not established that increased levels of SCEs are predictive of cancer or any other health out- come.",
            "The one epidemiologic study on the question has not, to date, observed any effect of elevated SCEs on cancer, based on 6 years of follow-up and 49 observed cancers in a Nordic 6-year prospective study of 3,182 people (25).",
            "The increased levels of all translocations are somewhat more worri- some, as translocations are common in tumors and often occur at sites of genes affecting cell cycle and tumor suppression (26).",

            "Yet little is known about intra-individual changes in DNA methylation over time in relationship to environmental exposures.",
            "Therefore, we evaluated the effects of acute- and chronic metal-rich PM2.5 exposures on DNA methylation.",
            "Methods",
            "Thirty-eight male boilermaker welders participated in a panel study for a total of 54 person days.",
            "Whole blood was collected prior to any welding activities (pre-shift) and immediately after the exposure period (post-shift).",
            "The percentage of methylated cytosines (%mC) in LINE-1, Alu, and inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS) were quantified using pyrosequencing.",
            "Personal PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter\u2009\u2264\u20092.5\u00a0\u03bcm) was measured over the work-shift.",
            "A questionnaire assessed job history and years worked as a boilermaker.",
            "Linear mixed models with repeated measures evaluated associations between DNA methylation, PM2.5 concentration (acute exposure), and years worked as a boilermaker (chronic exposure).",
            "Results",
            "PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased methylation in the promoter region of the iNOS gene (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.25, SE: 0.11, p-value\u2009=\u20090.04).",
            "Additionally, the number of years worked as a boilermaker was associated with increased iNOS methylation (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.03, SE: 0.01, p-value\u2009=\u20090.03).",
            "No associations were observed for Alu or LINE-1.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Acute and chronic exposure to PM2.5 generated from welding activities was associated with a modest change in DNA methylation of the iNOS gene.",
            "Future studies are needed to confirm this association and determine if the observed small increase in iNOS methylation are associated with changes in NO production or any adverse health effect.",
            "Background",
            "Boilermakers are skilled welders who cut and weld metal plates.",
            "They use a variety of welding technologies including oxyacetylene gas torches, gas tungsten arc welding, shielded metal arc welding, or gas metal arc welding.",
            "The extreme heat produced by welding generates a complex mixture of gases, aerosols and particulate matter.",
            "This molten mixture condenses into ultrafine and fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter\u2009\u2264\u20092.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM2.5) that is easily inhaled .",
            "Welding fumes are rich in metal oxides and can contain antimony, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, vanadium, and zinc although the exact composition of welding fumes will depend on many factors including base metal characteristics and type of welding.",
            "Epidemiological studies show that chronic exposure to welding fumes are associated with respiratory health effects including cardiovascular disease, asthma, bronchitis, lung function changes, and increased risk of lung cancer.",
            "While the mechanisms linking welding fume exposure to adverse health outcomes is not fully understood, previous studies implicate several biological pathways for welding fume toxicity including oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and alterations in cardiac autonomic responses.",
            "It is also possible that welding fumes alter epigenetic mechanisms and subsequently gene expression.",
            "Data from previous studies shows that many of the metals detected in welding fumes including nickel, lead, cadmium, chromium, beryllium, and arsenic are associated with altered DNA methylation.",
            "There is also evidence that exposure to particulate matter air pollution is associated with altered DNA methylation.",
            "Changes in DNA methylation have been observed in subjects with cardiovascular disease and cancer.",
            "Thus, it is possible that epigenetic changes may provide a potential mechanism by which welding fumes are linked to adverse biological effects.",
            "We, therefore, hypothesized that exposure to particulate matter generated from welding activities can alter DNA methylation.",
            "This hypothesis was tested in boilermakers who were previously recruited for a panel study designed to evaluate the cardiopulmonary health effects of welding fumes.",
            "We used existing data to explore the relationship between exposure to PM2.5 and DNA methylation over time because individuals provided blood samples collected both pre- and post-work shift, had personal PM2.5 occupational exposure measurements, and detailed work histories.",
            "Specifically, we hypothesized that exposure to PM2.5 over a single work shift would be associated with changes to DNA methylation, as well as, from cumulative exposure based on years worked as a welder.",
            "We employed a candidate gene approach and measured DNA methylation in short interspersed nucleotide elements (Alu) and long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE-1).",
            "These two repetitive elements make up approximately 55% of the human genome and are heavily methylated to suppress their expression.",
            "Repetitive elements are activated during conditions of cellular stress and de-methylation of LINE-1 and Alu elements increase their activity as retrotransposable sequences.",
            "Additionally, we quantified DNA methylation in the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS, also known as NOS2, Genbank accession number AF017634) which is involved in the production of nitric oxide and plays an important role in a variety of cardio-pulmonary processes including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular health.",
            "Methods",
            "Participant selection",
            "The Institutional Review Board at the Harvard School of Public Health approved the study protocol and informed consent was obtained prior to participation.",
            "The details of participant selection and study recruitment have been described previously.",
            "This analysis used samples collected from 38 individuals who had archived whole blood samples available for DNA extraction.",
            "Briefly, boilermaker construction workers were monitored on a high-exposure welding day and low-exposure non-welding days at the Union welding school in 2003 and 2008 as part of a panel study on welding fumes and cardiovascular risk.",
            "On non-welding days, participants performed office work in a large enclosed break room adjacent to the welding room.",
            "Per the initial study design, boilermakers were allowed to participate on multiple occasions in each observation period.",
            "We observed that two boilermakers participated in both 2003 and 2008 and three boilermakers participated twice on different days in 2008.",
            "Not all participants opted to provide a post-shift blood sample.",
            "Therefore, this analysis utilized 40 blood samples collected in the morning prior to the start of a work-shift (pre-shift) and 38 blood samples were collected in the afternoon after all work activities had been completed (post-shift).",
            "Also, twenty-four individuals provided two blood samples on the same observation day (pre- and post-shift).",
            "The most common type of welding was manual metal arc welding on mild (manganese alloys) and stainless steel (chromium and nickel alloys) bases.",
            "All welding was performed in a room outfitted with 10 workstations, each with local exhaust ventilation.",
            "Data collection",
            "A modified American Thoracic Society questionnaire was used to collect information on socio-demographic information, smoking history, occupational history and medical history.",
            "Exposure assessment",
            "All individuals wore personal gravimetric particulate samplers over the duration of the work shift using a KTL cyclone (GK2.05SH, BGI Incorporated, Waltham, MA) with an aerodynamic diameter \u22642.5\u00a0\u03bcm used in line with a pump drawing 3.5\u00a0L/min of air.",
            "The inlet tubing was secured to the participant\u2019s shoulder in the breathing zone area.",
            "Exposure to PM2.5 was measured over a six-hour welding shift or equivalent non-welding period as previously described by Cavallari et al..",
            "All samples were blank corrected.",
            "Two individuals were missing PM2.5 data.",
            "Air quality monitoring was performed on the same day as blood sample collection.",
            "DNA methylation",
            "Whole blood was collected in the morning before any welding activity (pre-shift) and in the afternoon at the end of the work shift (post-shift) and frozen at -80\u00b0C.",
            "Blood samples were collected at the same times each day to account for the potential influence of circadian rhythm.",
            "DNA was extracted using Puregene DNA solutions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).",
            "DNA methylation was quantitatively measured on bisulfite-treated DNA using PCR-Pyrosequencing following the methods described by Tarantini et al..",
            "The primers and sequence that was analyzed for each marker are presented in Table\u00a01.",
            "Samples were analyzed in duplicate and the average methylation, expressed for each DNA locus as the percentage of methylated cytosines (%mC) over the sum of methylated and unmethylated cytosine, was used in the statistical analysis.",
            "The coefficient of variation for each DNA locus was 0.009, 0.006, and 0.008 for LINE-1, iNOS, and Alu, respectively.",
            "All samples were subjected to a quality control check incorporated in the software which evaluates the bisulfite conversion rate of any cytosine not followed by a guanine.",
            "Five pre-shift and four post-shift blood samples failed pyrosequencing quality control for iNOS and were subsequently excluded from the analysis.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "The average %mC was calculated for 3 CpG sites in LINE-1, 3 CpG sites in Alu, and 4 CpG sites in iNOS.",
            "Linear mixed effects regression models with a repeated statement to account for repeated measurements on the same subjects were used to evaluate the relationship between %mC and PM2.5; as well as, the relationship between %mC and the number of years each individual worked as a boilermaker.",
            "Separate models were constructed for LINE-1, Alu, and iNOS.",
            "In the models that looked at cross-shift PM2.5 exposure, pre-shift blood %mC for each gene was included as a predictor in the models to control for individual factors that may influence methylation.",
            "Whereas, pre-shift blood %mC was not included in the models that evaluated the relationship between the number of years a person reported working as a boilermaker and methylation.",
            "All models were adjusted for smoking (yes/no), wearing a respirator (yes/no), and age.",
            "Since age was highly collinear with the number of years a person worked as a boilermaker (\u03c3spearman=0.57), we used the residuals from a regression model that had age as the dependent variable and years worked as a boilermaker to adjust for age (ageRS) in models that looked at the association between methylation and chronic exposure.",
            "All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.2.",
            "Results",
            "This panel study consisted of 38 adult males who provided a total of 54 measurement events (Table\u00a02).",
            "The average age of the participants at first enrollment was 35.6\u00a0years (range: 21.3 to 61.0\u00a0years) and they had worked an average of 6.8\u00a0years as a boilermaker (range: 1\u201335\u00a0years).",
            "The majority of participants reported their race as white (85.3%) and 31.6% reported that they currently smoked.",
            "In 13 instances during sampling, a respirator was used by the worker.",
            "The mean work shift exposure for PM2.5 over the 54 measurement events was 1.06\u00a0mg/m3 (median: 0.52\u00a0mg/m3, range: 0.02-3.41\u00a0mg/m3, average duration of exposure, 303.2\u00a0minutes; SD\u2009=\u200984.1\u00a0minutes; range: 61\u2013339\u00a0minutes).",
            "Eighty-two percent of the blood samples were collected from individuals who welded during the day of collection and 18% were collected from individuals who were present at the union hall but did not participate in any welding activities.",
            "The average percentage of methylated cytosines at baseline for Alu, LINE-1 and iNOS was 25.5%, 85.3%, and 97.5%, respectively (Table\u00a03).",
            "Linear mixed effect models evaluated the association between PM2.5 exposure across the work shift and methylation in blood samples collected post-shift (Table\u00a04).",
            "We observed that PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased methylation within the promoter region of the iNOS gene (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.25, SE: 0.11, p-value\u2009=\u20090.04) in models that adjusted for iNOS methylation measured pre-shift, current smoking status, age, and respirator usage.",
            "When the analysis was restricted to only those 25 individuals who actually performed welding activities on the observation day, the association between PM2.5 and iNOS methylation was marginally greater (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.35, SE: 0.11, p-value\u2009=\u20090.006).",
            "This suggested that individuals who were directly exposed to welding fume PM2.5 had a stronger response compared to individuals who were exposed to background PM2.5 within the practice hall.",
            "When the cohort was further restricted to exclude the five individuals who wore respirators on the observation day, the association between PM2.5 and iNOS methylation was fractionally greater (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.38, SE: 0.14, p-value\u2009=\u20090.02) which further supported the association between metal-rich welding fume PM2.5 and modest increased methylation in the promoter region of the iNOS gene.",
            "Overall, these results suggested that for every 1\u00a0mg/m3 increase in PM2.5, iNOS methylation increased an average of 0.25% (95% CI: 0.01 \u2013 0.48%).",
            "No association was observed between PM2.5 and Alu (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.05, SE: 0.07, p-value\u2009=\u20090.47) or LINE-1 (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.12, SE: 0.10, p-value\u2009=\u20090.28).",
            "To evaluate the association between DNA methylation and chronic exposure to PM2.5, linear mixed effect models evaluated the relationship between the number of years each participant worked as a boilermaker and DNA methylation (Table\u00a05).",
            "These models suggested that chronic exposure to welding fumes, as characterized by years worked as a boilermaker, were associated with small increases in methylation of the promoter region within the iNOS gene (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.03, SE: 0.01, p-value\u2009=\u20090.03) after adjusting for current smoking status and ageRS.",
            "No association between years worked as a boilermaker and methylation in Alu (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.004, SE: 0.004, p-value\u2009=\u20090.28) or LINE-1 (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.02, SE: 0.02, p-value\u2009=\u20090.28) was observed.",
            "We further restricted this analysis to only pre-shift samples to avoid the potential for acute work shift exposures to influence the observed associations and observed similar effects (Table\u00a06).",
            "Considering that smoking was common in this population and might be an effect modifier of iNOS methylation, an interaction term between years worked as a boilermaker and current smoking was also evaluated in the model.",
            "This interaction term was not significant which indicated that there was no effect modification by smoking status (\u03b2interaction\u2009=\u20090.10, SE: 0.09, p-value\u2009=\u20090.31).",
            "Discussion",
            "We observed that occupational exposure to fine particulate matter generated from welding activities measured across a single work-shift was associated with modest increases in DNA methylation in the promoter region of the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene in whole blood DNA.",
            "The number of years worked as a boilermaker was also associated with modest increased DNA methylation in the iNOS gene.",
            "However, we did not observe any relationship between acute exposure to welding fume PM2.5 or years worked and DNA methylation in two repeated elements, Alu and LINE-1.",
            "These findings suggest that methylation of the iNOS gene may be mutable over short periods of time.",
            "DNA methylation regulates gene expression with increased methylation leading to gene silencing.",
            "Biologically, it is plausible that iNOS could be influenced by exposure to PM2.5 generated from welding activities.",
            "Animal models show that acute exposure to welding fumes produce reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta.",
            "In turn, these immunologic and inflammatory factors stimulate inducible nitric oxide synthase which produces nitric oxide (NO) which can constrict vascular beds, produce hypertensive responses, regulate nonspecific host defenses, and modulate inflammation.",
            "These effects appear to depend on the PM composition.",
            "For instance, PM derived from urban sources diminished NO production, whereas, respirable cristobalite, fine particulate matter with enriched polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aerosols derived from wildfire smoke, and traffic-generated PM increased NO production.",
            "There is also evidence that welding fume PM2.5 influences NO production.",
            "Prior epidemiological research by our group showed that the fractional concentration of expired breath nitric oxide decreased after five days of exposure to welding-related PM2.5 and that the decreases in expired NO were associated with the soluble metal fraction in the PM2.5.",
            "This inhibition in exhaled NO would be consistent with diminished expression of genes involved in the synthesis of NO.",
            "Other environmental epigenetic studies have also investigated the association between particulate matter air pollution and DNA methylation in the iNOS gene.",
            "For instance, Tarantini et al. reported that particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters\u2009<\u200910\u00a0\u03bcm (PM10) was associated with a 0.61% decrease in methylation in the iNOS gene measured in whole blood DNA across a 3-work day period in a cohort of 63 foundry workers.",
            "Another study reported that 7-day average ambient PM2.5 was associated with decreased iNOS methylation (0.30% decrease in iNOS per 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5) in DNA extracted from buccal cells collected from 940 children who resided in the Los Angeles area.",
            "Both of these studies observed an inverse association between increased particulate matter exposure and decreased DNA methylation in the iNOS gene.",
            "Whereas, our study observed a positive association between increased PM2.5 and increased DNA methylation in the iNOS gene.",
            "It is not clear why the direction of the effect differs between our study and the two previous studies but it is worth noting we measured different CpG sites within the promoter region of the iNOS gene and perhaps different CpG sites even within the same promoter region respond differently to environmental stimuli.",
            "Also, the composition of the particulate matter likely differed between the studies.",
            "It is also possible there was an uncontrolled confounding by smoking and/or second hand smoke exposure.",
            "As such, it is difficult to draw direct comparisons between the three studies.",
            "We recognize that there are several limitations to our study.",
            "Methylation is tissue specific and we used DNA extracted from whole blood which is a mixture of different white blood cell types.",
            "Ultrafine particles diffuse across the alveoli and enter the bloodstream where they exert a direct effect on white blood cells by triggering an immune response.",
            "Since we did not measure white blood cell counts or measure DNA methylation in specific white blood cell sub-populations we cannot rule out that the increased iNOS DNA methylation was produced by systemic inflammation from inhaling fine particulate matter.",
            "Another limitation of the study was that we did not collect samples that would allow for measurement of gene expression or production of nitric oxide to determine if the methylation changes in iNOS had any biological impact.",
            "However, our study had several strengths including personal measurements of PM2.5 across the work shift which minimizes the potential for misclassification of exposure.",
            "We used pyrosequencing which is a very sensitive method and provides a quantitative measurement of DNA methylation.",
            "It is also worth noting that the blood samples were stored for several years in a cold storage facility at \u221280\u00b0C prior to analysis which likely reduced DNA yield but not DNA quality.",
            "Conclusions",
            "We observed a positive relationship between occupational exposure to fine particulate matter generated from welding activities and a modest increase in DNA methylation in the promoter region of the iNOS across a single work shift.",
            "We also observed a positive association between the number of years a person reported working as a boilermaker and increased DNA methylation in the iNOS gene.",
            "These results suggest that DNA methylation may be altered by PM2.5 over a short period of time.",
            "Further studies are needed that collect multiple measurements over longer periods of time to more fully understand the dynamic relationship between welding fume exposures and DNA methylation.",
            "These studies should also measure blood cell mixture to determine if the changes in DNA methylation are true epigenetic effects or a function of inflammation."

            "Although some effects in experimental studies are mediated by PPAR-\u03b1 binding, some other effects occur independently of this receptor.",
            "PPAR-\u03b1 is also induced by PFOA and PFOS in transiently transfected human fibroblast-like cell line COS-1, in a concentration-dependent and in a roughly chain-length\u2013dependent fashion.",

            "In this population, overall PFOA levels were much higher [mean, 83.0 ng/mL; interquartile range (IQR), 13.4\u201370.6 ng/mL] than in corresponding U.S. population surveys (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the same year: mean, 3.9 ng/mL; IQR, 2.7\u20135.8 ng/mL).",

            "A comparable distribution is observable for PFOS, although in a narrower range of exposure (Figure 1A,B).",
            "This positive association was also observed in logistic regression models with a steady increase in the odds ratio (OR) estimates across deciles of both PFOA and PFOS (p-value for trends across deciles in both models < 0.001), and a significant OR for both ln-unit of PFOA (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.13) and ln-unit of PFOS (OR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.18; Table 3).",
            "Subjects with abnormally high ALT values were evenly distributed across water districts (chi-square test, p = 0.172) and had significantly higher PFOA and PFOS serum concentrations compared with those with normal ALT values (PFOA: 106.8 vs. 84.6 IU/L, p < 0.001; PFOS: 24.3 vs. 23.3 IU/L, p < 0.001).",
            "No interaction between PFOA/PFOS deciles with fasting status was observed (p-values 0.816 and 0.387, -respectively).",

            "The suggested association with PFOA, however, was not confirmed in the logistic regression model, in which no trend across deciles was observed (p = 0.213), or for the linear ln-units of PFOA values (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.04; Table 3).",
            "For PFOS, there was some evidence of a slight inverse association with GGT in the minimally adjusted linear regression model (model 1), which was lost after adjusting for additional confounders (model 3; Table 2).",
            "The logistic regression by deciles of PFOS suggested a weak negative trend across deciles, although all ORs were close to 1, and no overall association with ln-PFOS was observed (Table 3).",

            "For direct bilirubin, there was a suggestion of an inverse U-shaped relationship with PFOA, with increasing levels of bilirubin per increasing levels of PFOA at low PFOA levels, and decreasing bilirubin levels for concentrations of PFOA above about 40 ng/mL (Figure 1E).",
            "Overall, the linear regression relationship failed to show any association in the adjusted model (Table 2), and the likelihood ratio test after introducing the quadratic term was statistically significant (p < 0.001).",

            "There was a significant difference between the between- and within-district components (p-value B/W\u0394) for ALT and direct bilirubin; however, each outcome showed different patterns.",
            "The between--water-district regression coefficient from linear regression of ln-PFOA and ALT (0.010; 95% CI: \u20130.001, 0.020) was lower than the within-water-district coefficient (0.027; 95% CI: 0.022, 0.031).",
            "However, both coefficients were significant or borderline significant, in the same direction, and consistent with a positive association between ALT and PFOA levels.",
            "Although the regression coefficient for the association between GGT and ln-PFOA within water district was positive and significant (0.016; 95% CI: 0.010, 0.023), this association was not significant in the between-water-district analysis (0.005; 95% CI: \u20130.009, 0.018); the p-value for interaction between/within water district was not significant (p = 0.108).",
            "Conversely, there was a significant inverse relationship between ln-PFOA and direct bilirubin between water districts (\u20130.013; 95% CI: \u20130.022, \u20130.005) but not within water districts (0.0001; 95% CI: \u20130.004, 0.004).",

            "These results show a positive association between PFOA and PFOS concentrations and ALT serum levels, a marker of hepatocellular damage.",
            "The linear association, consistently replicated in all analyses, showed a monotonic increase in logistic regression.",
            "Furthermore, the presence of a consistent relationship in regression analysis both between water districts and among individuals within districts increases strength of evidence for causal association.",
            "The proportion of laboratory abnormal values rises in relation to PFOA, but the small amount of variation in outcomes explained by PFOA (partial R2 \u2264 0.1%) suggests caution.",
            "The observed associations between PFOA or PFOS and ALT are generally consistent in terms of direction and magnitude with previous findings of occupational studies.",
            "A cross-sectional study of 1,025 workers at the same plant leading to the C8 Health Project reported an association between PFOA and ALT levels with a similar coefficient (mean \u00b1 SE coefficient of log-transformed values, 0.023 \u00b1 0.015; p = 0.124).",
            "A significant linear regression coefficient between log-transformed\u2013PFOA and log-ALT (coefficient, 0.025 \u00b1 0.013; p = 0.006) was described in a cross-sectional occupational surveillance conducted in three 3M plants in the United States and Belgium.",
            "A small occupational study conducted in Italy showed a significant positive association between PFOA and ALT levels among workers exposed to PFOA (coefficient, 0.116; 95% CI: 0.054, 0.177; p < 0.01).",
            "Notably, these results are also consistent with data coming from a general population survey (mean \u00b1 SE linear regression coefficients with ALT: PFOA, 1.86 \u00b1 0.62, p = 0.005; PFOS, 1.01 \u00b1 0.53, p = 0.066) where background concentrations of PFOA are much lower than those reported here.",
            "Only one previous study of this same population reported no association with ALT (regression coefficient = \u20130.00416, p = 0.65); however, the observation was based on a much smaller sample (most of whom were likely to be included in the present analysis) and based on figures coming from models including non-log-transformed exposure or outcome variables.",
            "Evidence for an association between PFOA and PFOS and GGT is not so clear.",
            "Although there was some suggestion of an association in the linear regression models with PFOA, it was not replicated in logistic regression models.",
            "The instability of linear regression coefficients (which are very sensitive to the inclusion of additional covariates) might be due to a confounding effect of diet, or residual confounding of alcohol consumption, which causes a direct increase of GGT.",
            "Finally, the absence of any trend across districts\u2014even though there are large contrasts in between-district mean exposures\u2014might be indicative of some confounding factor acting at the individual level.",
            "As shown recently, GGT levels are positively associated with alcohol and meat intake after adjusting for all potential non-dietary confounders.",
            "To support this, there is indirect evidence from an occupational study that reported a significant association between ln-GGT and ln-PFOA in models adjusted by ln-age, ln-BMI, and ln-alcohol (mean \u00b1 SE coefficient, 0.033 \u00b1 0.017, p = 0.05), which drops if BMI is replaced by ln-tryglicerides (a proxy for diet) in the model (coefficient, 0.010 \u00b1 0.016, p = 0.55).",
            "PFOA concentration has a positive association with direct bilirubin up to 40 ng/mL, followed by a decrease of bilirubin levels after this peak.",
            "A negative association between PFOA or PFOS and direct bilirubin has been observed in some occupational studies, which might be because they used mainly subjects in the higher range of exposure, missing the first part of an inverse U-shaped curve.",
            "The figures of the between-district comparison might reflect the fact that the means of the four highest districts are well above the value of 30 ng/mL and may account for a larger portion of the observed association above that value, or this may be evidence of some geographic confounding.",
            "The hepatotoxic effect of PFOA in rodents leading to liver enlargement and altered hepato-cyte histology appears to be mediated in part by PPAR-\u03b1 agonism, leading to altered expression of the genes involved in peroxisome proliferation, cell cycle control, and apoptosis.",
            "Although different mechanisms also play a role in humans, human cellular responses do predict a PPAR-\u03b1 response.",
            "In the human population data presented here, the association of PFOS concentration with increasing trans-aminase is almost as prominent as the association for PFOA, and human laboratory cell data indicate relatively lower response of liver cells to PFOS than to PFOA.",
            "The consistency and significance of associations of ALT end points outside the normal range with PFOA serum concentration suggest a true association with an underlying hepatotoxic effect in humans.",
            "However, only a small proportion of end points fell outside the normal value range, making the observed results more difficult to interpret in terms of human health risk.",
            "In particular, it is not clear if this small increase in ALT levels can lead to clinically diagnosable conditions in the future, or if this effect is reversible (i.e., if it is reduced after removal of the exposure to PFOA).",
            "Finally, results coming from this study need to be read in the context of health effect of PFAAs on humans, but data cannot be directly used for estimating single-subject damage in relation to exposure.",
            "The main limitation of the present study is the cross-sectional design, which makes causal inference particularly difficult.",
            "However, the consistency of the findings with previous literature\u2014in particular the association with ALT\u2014reinforces the hypothesis of a true association.",
            "Also, self-reported data of lifestyle characteristics being strongly associated with the exposures of interest can hamper a correct adjustment for potential confounders, which might be of particular relevance given the small magnitude of the observed associations.",
            "However, this study is the largest reported so far on this topic on a population-based sample of residents exposed to relatively high concentrations of PFOA.",
            "Conclusions",
            "A small but clear linear association between PFOA and PFOS serum concentrations and ALT, a marker of hepatocellular injury, was observed in this large population-based sample of individuals with exposure to PFAAs.",
            "These results are consistent with previous findings and warrant further investigation, in particular on the potential health consequence of long-term exposure and potential -accumulation of damage."

            "We conducted the first serologic case\u2013control study of MCV and SCC.",
            "Methods",
            "Patients with histologically confirmed cutaneous SCC (n = 173) were recruited from a university dermatology clinic.",
            "Controls were individuals who screened negative for and had no history of skin or other cancers (n = 300).",
            "Levels of antibodies against capsid antigens for MCV and another polyomavirus, JC virus (JCV), were determined by fluorescent bead-based multiplex serology.",
            "Fresh-frozen tumor tissues were obtained from 145 SCC cases and tested for MCV DNA by multiplexed PCR.",
            "Associations between MCV seroreactivity and SCC were estimated by ORs and 95% CIs calculated using logistic regression with adjustment for age and sex.",
            "Results",
            "MCV DNA was detected in SCC tumor tissues from 55 (38%) of 145 cases.",
            "A statistically significant association was observed between MCV seropositivity and MCV DNA-positive SCC (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.03\u20136.04), with an almost four-fold association observed when comparing those with MCV antibodies in the fourth versus first quartiles (OR = 3.93, 95% CI = 1.43\u201310.76, Ptrend = 0.01).",
            "No significant associations were observed between MCV seropositivity and MCV DNA-negative SCC (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.76\u20132.48) or between JCV seropositivity and MCV DNA-positive or DNA-negative SCC.",

            "Impact",
            "Understanding the role of viral infections in the development of nonmelanoma skin cancer could lead to novel prevention strategies.",
            "Introduction",
            "Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) was first discovered in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) tumor tissues, with 80% of MCC tissues testing positive for MCV DNA.",
            "Subsequent studies have confirmed that MCV DNA is present in 40% to 100% of MCC tissues, as recently reviewed.",
            "A subset of these MCC studies investigated the presence of MCV in other types of nonmelanoma skin cancers for comparison with MCC, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).",
            "Taken together with studies that specifically assessed MCV in SCC, MCV DNA prevalence estimates range from 0% to 25% for SCC among immunocompetent individuals.",
            "Similar to MCC, SCC occurs more often among immunocompromised patients, with organ transplant recipients experiencing a significant 56-fold increased risk of developing cutaneous SCC compared with the general population.",
            "One study reported that MCV DNA was more common among SCC tumors arising in immunocompromised patients (52%) than immunocompetent patients (25%).",
            "However, a separate study of 85 organ transplant recipients reported MCV DNA in 0% of 85 SCC tumor tissues.",

            "Furthermore, there have been no epidemiologic studies investigating the association between MCV seroreactivity and SCC.",
            "To investigate the association between exposure to MCV and SCC, we conducted a case\u2013control study, comparing MCV seroreactivity between SCC cases and controls.",

            "Cases were defined as histologically confirmed cutaneous SCC patients who were approached for recruitment consecutively through the USF Dermatology clinic in 2007 to 2009.",
            "Pathology reports were obtained for all cases to verify SCC diagnoses.",
            "Controls comprised of patients undergoing skin cancer screening exams at Moffitt's Lifetime Cancer Screening Clinic (LCS) or the USF Family Medicine clinic that were determined not to have any type of skin cancer and reported no history of skin or other cancers.",
            "All study participants had to be between the ages of 18 and 80 years.",
            "Individuals were eligible to participate regardless of immune status, and 9 SCC cases (5%) reported a history of organ transplantation.",
            "All participants provided written informed consent, and all study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the USF.",
            "Of the nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) patients approached at the USF Dermatology Clinic, 79% agreed to participate, including 185 SCC cases.",
            "There were no statistically significant differences in age or gender between those who agreed to participate and those who refused.",
            "Of the 756 patients recruited through the LCS and USF Family Medicine Clinic, 432 (57%) agreed to participate, of whom 281 (65%) screened negative for skin cancer.",
            "Of the 151 (35%) who were referred for a follow-up exam with a dermatologist, 95 (63%) were successfully recontacted and had completed the follow-up exam, 77 of whom were determined not to have skin cancer and were included in the study as controls.",
            "The 18 patients who were determined to have skin cancer based on the follow-up exam included 6 patients diagnosed with SCC, 9 patients diagnosed with BCC, and 3 patients diagnosed with melanoma or NMSC not otherwise specified.",
            "The 6 SCC patients were included as cases in this study and the other NMSC patients were excluded.",
            "The 56 screening patients who were referred to a dermatologist and never completed the follow-up exam or were unsuccessfully recontacted by study staff on 3 separate occasions were considered lost to follow-up and excluded from the study.",
            "There were no statistically significant differences in age or gender between those that completed screening follow-up and those that did not.",
            "Blood samples were available for 91% of SCC cases and 95% of controls.",
            "The study population for the current serologic analysis was restricted to White individuals, with the exception of 2 non-White controls, resulting in a final sample size of 173 SCC cases and 300 controls.",

            "There was no significant difference in MCV seroprevalence between controls recruited from the 2 different clinics.",
            "In addition to blood sample collection, a 3 mm punch of tumor was obtained at the time of surgical excision and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.",
            "Of the 191 SCC cases who agreed to participate in the study, tumor tissues were obtained from 162 (85%) individuals who contributed a total of 185 tumor samples.",
            "All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that contained questions on demographics and skin cancer risk factors including smoking status, alcohol consumption, hair and eye color, and measures of sun susceptibility and/or exposure, including one's skin reaction to repeated sun exposure (unable to tan, tan if you work at it, tans easily), history of a blistering sunburn, and ever having a job in the sun for at least 3 months.",
            "MCV antibody measurement",
            "Seroreactivity against MCV (isolate 344) capsid (VP1) protein was measured by fluorescent bead-based multiplex serology and expressed as the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 100 or more beads per set per serum sample, as previously described for human papilloma-viruses and the polyomaviruses BK virus (BKV), JCV, and simian virus 40 (SV40).",
            "To assess specificity of the SCC association with MCV and to address the possibility that MCV seroreactivity may be a marker of increased immunosuppression among the SCC cases compared with controls, antibodies to JCV, which is known to reactivate upon immunosuppression, were also measured.",
            "To determine the cut points for defining polyomavirus seropositivity, percentile plots of the strength of the antibody reactions were created, the inflection points were determined by visual inspection, and for each virus, the binary cut point was calculated as the median of the data points immediately below and above the inflection point.",
            "MCV DNA detection",
            "DNA extraction from fresh-frozen SCC tumor tissues was carried out with the QIAGEN BioRobot EZ1 with the EZ1 DNA Tissue Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN).",
            "Briefly, frozen tissues were incubated in proteinase K and a buffer G2 (QIAGEN) at 56\u00b0C until the tissue was completely lysed.",
            "To monitor the possible occurrence of cross-contamination between the different specimens during DNA extraction, tubes containing buffer only were also included.",
            "Five microliters of purified DNA was analyzed for the human PyVs BKV, JCV, KIV, WUV, and MCV, as well as the monkey PyVs SV40 by multiplex PCR using the Multiplex PCR Kit (QIAGEN) as previously described.",
            "Type-specific PCR primers target a conserved region of the large T-antigen (LT) gene at the N-terminus and amplify a DNA fragment of approximately 200 nucleotides.",
            "PCR products were obtained even when only 10 copies of the viral genome were used as template (data not shown).",
            "Two primers for the amplification of b-globin were also added in the assay to provide a positive control for the quality of the template DNA.",
            "Typing of the specific polyomaviruses were carried out by hybridization of the PCR products to type-specific Luminex-bead coupled PyV probes as described by Steinbeis Transfer Centre Multiplexion and Luminex corporation.",
            "The sequence of the PCR primers and Luminex probes could be provided upon request.",
            "PCR products were denatured and hybridized to the beads coupled with specific probes for the 6 polyomaviruses.",
            "Results were expressed as the MFI of at least 100 beads per bead set.",
            "For each probe, MFI values with no respective PCR product added to the hybridization mixture were considered background values.",
            "The cutoff was computed by adding 5 MFI to 1.1\u00d7 the median background value.",
            "For specificity evaluation, cloned HPV genomes and human specimen were used.",
            "No crossreactivity has been found (data not shown).",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "Demographic and skin cancer risk factors were compared between SCC cases and controls and between MCVseropositive and MCV-seronegative controls by the \u03c72 test, with the exception of age, for which the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used.",
            "Boxplots of MCV antibody levels expressed in MFI were created for SCC cases (overall and stratified by MCV DNA status of the tumor) and controls.",
            "Mean MCV antibody levels were compared between these groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.",
            "Using binary cut points (792 and 885 MFI for MCV and JCV respectively), polyomavirus seropositivity was defined separately for each virus, and associations with SCC were estimated by calculating ORs and 95% CIs using logistic regression.",
            "Quartiles of MCV and JCV seroreactivity were defined based on the control distributions of these antibody levels, and associations with SCC were estimated by calculating the OR and 95% CI for the second, third, and fourth quartiles, compared with the first (i.e., lowest) quartile.",
            "Tests for trend were conducted by including an ordinal variable in the logistic regression model indicating the quartile of polyomavirus seroreactivity.",
            "Demographic and skin cancer risk factors that were associated with case\u2013control status (education, smoking, alcohol consumption, eye and hair color, skin reaction to the sun, sunburn history, and having had a job in the sun) were evaluated as potential confounders of the association between MCV and SCC by individual placement in a model including age and sex as covariates.",
            "None of the factors resulted in more than a 10% change in the risk estimate for MCV and SCC, and therefore, only age and sex were included in the final models.",
            "Analyses were conducted excluding the 9 SCC cases with a history of organ transplantation, and results were similar, thus, these 9 cases were included in the final analysis.",
            "SCC cases who contributed tumor tissues were classified according to the presence or absence of MCV DNA in their tumor tissue.",
            "For the 19 SCC cases who contributed tissue from multiple, distinct, concurrent tumors, cases were considered MCV DNA positive if at least 1 tumor tested positive for MCV DNA.",
            "Associations between MCV seroreactivity and SCC stratified by MCV DNA status were calculated using separate logistic regression models comparing MCV DNA-positive SCC cases to controls and MCV DNA-negative SCC cases to controls, adjusting for age and sex.",
            "A case\u2013case analysis was also conducted, directly comparing MCV seroreactivity between MCV DNA-positive and MCV DNA-negative SCC.",

            "All tests were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.",
            "Results",
            "Demographic and skin cancer risk factors are presented for cases and controls in Table 1.",
            "Compared with controls, SCC cases were older, less educated, and more likely to be male.",
            "Cases were also statistically significantly more likely to be ever smokers and less likely to have had at least 1 alcoholic drink in the past year.",
            "All but 2 study participants were White.",
            "Markers of sun sensitivity and exposure were all associated with SCC, including eye color, hair color, skin's reaction to repeated sun exposure, history of a blistering sunburn, and ever having had a job in the sun for at least 3 months (Table 1).",
            "Among the controls, there were no significant differences in MCV seropositivity by age, education, or sex with MCV seroprevalences of 72% and 74% observed for males and females, respectively (Table 2).",
            "Smoking status was not associated with MCV seropositivity, whereas those who had at least 1 alcoholic drink in the past year were less likely to be MCV seropositive than those who had no drinks.",
            "None of the measures of sun sensitivity and exposure were associated with MCV seropositivity (Table 2).",
            "Of the SCC lesions diagnosed among the cases in this study, 52% occurred on the head or neck, 30% on the arms, 12% on the legs, and 6% on the torso.",
            "Of the 185 SCC tumor tissues obtained for DNA analysis, 179 (97%) were b-globin positive, including 66 (37%) that were MCV DNA positive.",
            "All tissues were negative for the other 5 polyomaviruses (JCV, BKV, KIV, WUV, and SV40).",
            "Among 16 patients for whom tissue samples were obtained from 2 distinct, concurrent tumors, 4 had MCV DNA in both of their tumors, 9 had MCV DNA in neither tumor, and 3 had MCV DNA in 1 tumor but not the other, for an overall percent agreement across tissues of 81%.",
            "Among 3 patients for whom tissue samples were obtained from 3 distinct, concurrent tumors, 1 had MCV DNA in all 3 tumors, and the other 2 were MCV DNA negative across all 3 tissues.",
            "MCV antibody levels were significantly higher among SCC cases [mean (SD) = 8,228 (6,617) MFI] compared with controls [mean (SD) = 6,495 (5,891); P = 0.004].",
            "Associations between MCV seroreactivity and SCC overall are presented in Table 3.",
            "MCV seropositivity was associated with an increased risk of SCC, although the association was not statistically significant (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 0.96\u20132.60), and there was no clear trend in SCC risk with increasing levels of MCV seroreactivity (Ptrend = 0.15).",
            "Similarly, SCC was not associated with seropositivity for the other polyomavirus measured, JCV (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 0.89\u20132.20).",
            "Both serology and DNA data were available from 145 SCC cases, of whom 55 (38%) were MCV DNA positive.",
            "MCV seroreactivity, expressed in microfluorescence intensity units (MFI), is plotted for SCC cases and controls in Fig.",
            "1. Compared with controls, MCV seroreactivity was significantly greater among the 55 SCC cases that had MCV DNA in their SCC tumor tissues (P < 0.0001).",
            "No differences were observed when the 90 SCC patients who were MCV DNA negative were compared with controls (P = 0.85).",
            "MCV seropositivity was significantly associated with MCV DNA-positive SCC (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.03\u20136.04; Table 4).",
            "In addition, risk of MCV DNA-positive SCC increased with increasing antibody levels (OR for quartile 4 versus quartile 1 = 3.93, 95% CI = 1.43\u201310.76, Ptrend = 0.01).",
            "Similar associations were observed when 5 organ transplant patients were excluded from the MCV DNA-positive SCC case group (OR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.25\u20139.52, Ptrend = 0.01) and when MCV DNA-positive cases were compared directly with MCV DNA-negative cases (OR = 5.76, 95% CI = 1.82\u201318.28, Ptrend = 0.0004).",
            "In contrast, there was no association between MCV seropositivity and SCC among DNA-negative cases (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.76\u20132.48).",
            "Seropositivity for JCV was not associated with SCC, regardless of tumor MCV DNA status (Table 4).",
            "Discussion",
            "In this first serologic case\u2013control study of MCV infection and SCC, MCV seroreactivity was statistically significantly associated with MCV DNA-positive SCC.",
            "There are several possible explanations for the observed serologic associations.",
            "MCV seroreactivity could simply be a marker of a general systemic immunosuppression, an established risk factor for SCC.",
            "If this was the case, then associations with SCC would be expected to be observed also for JCV seroreactivity, given that JCV reactivates with immunosuppression.",
            "Although a greater proportion of SCC cases were JCV-seropositive than controls, the difference was not statistically significant, and no trend was observed between increasing quartiles of JCV antibody levels and SCC risk.",
            "Uncontrolled MCV replication resulting from localized cutaneous immunosuppression is theoretically possible, given the previously described effects of UV radiation on antigen presentation and cytokine production in the skin.",
            "However, no associations between any of the markers of sun exposure or skin sensitivity to sun were associated with MCV seropositivity among the controls, and adjustment for these factors did not alter the magnitude of the observed association between MCV seroreactivity and SCC, suggesting that UV-induced cutaneous immunosuppression is not a confounder.",
            "MCV could be a \u201cpassenger virus\u201d in SCC, present in tumor tissues but not causally associated, in which case antibodies would simply be a marker of the disease.",
            "Additional serologic markers of MCV infection could be measured, such as antibodies against the MCV LT.",
            "However, at least 1 study has reported the absence of T-antigen expression in SCC tumors, indicating that LT antibodies may not be present in SCC cases.",
            "A final possible explanation for the observed findings is that MCV infection plays a role in SCC pathogenesis.",
            "To clearly distinguish whether MCV is a risk factor or a marker of disease, a prospective study is needed, investigating the presence of MCV infection prior to SCC development.",
            "This study was clinic based and may have been subject to selection bias.",
            "However, the clinics from which cases and controls were recruited largely serve the same underlying population, with an estimated 28% of the SCC cases having records in the family medicine clinic from which the controls were recruited.",
            "Furthermore, MCV seropositivity was not associated with any of the demographic or skin cancer risk factors assessed, and therefore, there is no reason to think that either comparison group was biased with respect to MCV seropositivity.",
            "Because SCC cases were eligible for the study if they had a history of any other type of cancer, whereas potential controls with a history of cancer were excluded, the observed findings could have been biased if MCV is associated with those cancers.",
            "However, there was no significant difference in MCV seroprevalence between SCC cases with or without a self-reported history of cancer prior to their SCC diagnosis.",
            "The advantages to the clinic-based design included the ability to conduct physical exams to rule out prevalent disease among the controls, and the accessibility of fresh-frozen tumor tissues from the cases.",
            "The use of 2 different laboratories for the measurement of MCV DNA in tumor tissues and serum antibodies is another study strength, given that the personnel in each laboratory were masked to the results generated from the other laboratory.",
            "MCV DNA was observed in 38% of fresh-frozen SCC tumor tissues, a higher proportion than observed in previous studies.",
            "However, all previous studies investigated formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.",
            "It is possible that DNA degradation may have contributed to lower MCV DNA prevalence estimates in some of these studies, particularly when larger PCR amplicons were used.",
            "Compared with SCC, MCV DNA has been reported in a much higher proportion of MCC (\u223c75%) in most published case series.",
            "Although MCV is more prevalent in MCC than in SCC, the number of SCC cases potentially attributed to MCV in the general population is far greater than that of MCC, given that close to 1 million SCC cases are diagnosed each year in the United States in contrast to 1,500 cases of MCC.",
            "If MCV is shown to play a role in SCC carcinogenesis, then this polyomavirus may be a novel target for primary prevention through vaccination."

            "This also holds for the echA encoded enzyme.",
            "Despite the low sequence similarity, the GarGXS and the HGXP sequences were strictly conserved.",
            "In DhlA, the sequence HGEP forms the oxyanion hole in which the backbone amide hydrogen of Glu56, which is located on a sharp cis-proline turn, stabilizes the oxyanion that is formed on the side chain carbonyl oxygen of the nucleophilic Asp124 during the hydrolysis of the ester intermediate.",
            "His54 forms a hydrogen bond (N\u03b41-O) with the backbone carbonyl of Gly55, causing a sharp turn (14).",
            "Mutation of His148 to Asn in this motif in rat microsomal epoxide hydrolase led to a significant decrease in activity (47).",
            "This indicates that a sharp turn in the oxyanion hole is essential for enzyme activity and that therefore this motif is well conserved.",
            "The function of the GarGXS motif in DhlA is not described, but it is part of a large loop with three \u03b2-turns, and it is located close to the oxyanion hole and the nucleophilic Asp124.",
            "Since this motif is well conserved, it may have a function in positioning of the oxyanion hole in regard to the nucleophile.",
            "In DhlA, the side chain of the aromatic residue Phe85 of the motif GFGDS is in a tilted-T arrangement with His54 of the oxyanion hole motif, in which the positively charged His ring stands perpendicular on the slightly negative charged surface of Phe85.",
            "No hydrogen bonds or salt bridges were found between these motifs, but a His-Phe interaction can have a considerable stabilizing effect (50, 51).",
            "The \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase fold is a conserved topology with a main domain that consists of a central \u03b2-sheet that is alternated with \u03b1-helices that cover both sides.",
            "In the structures of haloalkane dehalogenase and bromoperoxidase A2, the \u03b1-helical cap domain follows \u03b2-strand 6 and covers the active site like a cap.",
            "The positions of the secondary structure elements of haloalkane dehalogenase and bromoperoxidase A2 compared with the secondary structure elements that were predicted for epoxide hydrolase strongly suggest a specific topology for epoxide hydrolase (Fig. 3).",
            "The cap domain of epoxide hydrolase therefore seems to be located between \u03b2-strands 6 and 7 (residues 132\u2013209), since this is the only part of the alignment that shows little similarity in both sequence and secondary structure predictions.",
            "In \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase fold enzymes the \u03b2-sheet forms a scaffold for the catalytic triad residues, that are located on loops excursing from the \u03b2-sheet, and since these residues are preserved in the topology, they are also conserved in the sequence.",
            "Mutation of the residues Asp107, His275, and Asp246of epoxide hydrolase, resulted in a dramatic drop of enzyme activity, which indicates that these residues are involved in catalysis.",
            "The Asp246 \u2192 Ala mutant still had some residual activity for epichlorohydrin, indicating that this residue is involved in enzymatic activity but not essential.",
            "Mutation of the acid residue in haloalkane dehalogenase,3",
            "3\nG. H. Krooshof, unpublished data.",
            "2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (49), and soluble epoxide hydrolase (46) resulted in an inactivated enzyme.",
            "Probably, Asp246 has some backup in EchA.",
            "In triacylglycerol lipase from Pseudomonas glumae, a partially redundant catalytic aspartate was reported (52).",
            "In human pancreatic lipase an alternative catalytic triad was found in which the catalytic aspartate was shifted from \u03b2-strand 7 to \u03b2-strand 6 at position 176 (53).",
            "In the crystal structure of DhlA, Asn148 is the analog of Asp176 of human pancreatic lipase and is located directly after \u03b2-strand 6 where it forms a hydrogen bond with the nucleophilic Asp124 (14).",
            "In the sequence alignment, Asp131 of EchA is aligned with Asn148 of haloalkane dehalogenase (Fig. 3).",
            "So, Asp131 of epoxide hydrolase is probably positioned close to the nucleophilic Asp107 and the catalytic His275.",
            "The presence of another aspartate may be sufficient to retain some activity in EchA when Asp246 is replaced by alanine.",
            "The same argument can also explain why no acid residue could be found in Fig. 3 for DehH1.",
            "Residue Asp129 of DehH1, which is aligned with Asp131 of EchA and Asn148of DhlA, could well be part of an alternative catalytic triad, as present in human pancreatic lipase (53).",
            "Based on these results, we propose a reaction mechanism for EchA in which the catalytic Asp107 performs a nucleophilic attack on the primary carbon atom of epichlorohydrin, leading to a covalently bound ester intermediate (Fig. 6\n).",
            "It was shown earlier using 18O-labeled water that hydrolysis takes place at the primary carbon atom of the epoxide ring (15).",
            "His275, assisted by Asp246, abstracts a proton from a water molecule that hydrolyzes the ester at the carbonyl function of Asp107.",
            "Phe108 of epoxide hydrolase, which is located next to the nucleophile Asp107, is probably interacting with the epoxide ring.",
            "In haloalkane dehalogenase, Trp125 is involved in halogen and halide binding (54).",
            "The eukaryotic epoxide hydrolases all have a tryptophan at this position, but a positively charged edge of phenylalanine is also capable of binding the electronegative oxygen atom of the epoxide ring (55, 56).",
            "A phenylalanine residue next to the nucleophilic serine was also found in 2hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoate hydrolase and two 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolases that had sequence similarity with EchA.",
            "Beetham et al. (11) postulated that a proton donating group (K-H) should be present in the cap domain of soluble epoxide hydrolase and protonates the leaving group, an oxyanion that is formed upon opening of the epoxide ring.",
            "They mentioned Lys406 as a possible candidate, since this residue is conserved among soluble epoxide hydrolases and since chemical modification resulted in inactivation of the enzyme.",
            "An alignment of EchA with all soluble epoxide hydrolases indicates that this is the only lysine that is conserved in the cap domain (data not shown).",
            "The alignment points out Lys173 of EchA as a possible candidate, but also the two nearby positioned Lys residues 174 and 177 could perform the role as proton donor.",
            "The role of Lys173, Lys174, and Lys177 is currently studied further by site-directed mutagenesis and fluorescence spectroscopy."

            "Background:",
            "Few epidemiological studies have explored the associations between occupational exposures and lung cancer in lifelong nonsmoking men.",
            "Methods:",
            "We obtained lifetime occupational history and other relevant information for 132 newly diagnosed lung cancer cases among nonsmoking Chinese men and 536 nonsmoking community referents.",
            "Unconditional multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of lung cancer for specific occupational exposures.",
            "Results:",
            "Significantly increased lung cancer risk was found for nonsmoking workers occupationally exposed to silica dust (OR=2.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11, 6.01), diesel exhaust (OR=3.47, 95% CI: 1.08, 11.14), spray painting (OR=2.81, 95% CI: 1.14, 6.93), and nonspray painting work (OR=2.36, 95% CI: 1.04, 5.37).",
            "Silica dust exposure was associated with a significantly increased risk of adenocarcinoma (OR=2.91, 95% CI: 1.10, 7.68).",
            "We observed a positive gradient of all lung cancers and of adenocarcinoma with duration of employment for workers exposed to silica dust and spray painting.",
            "Conclusion:",
            "This study found an increased risk of lung cancer among nonsmoking Chinese men occupationally exposed to silica dust, diesel exhaust, and painting work.",
            "Tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer, contributing around 80% of lung cancer cases of European men and 58% of Chinese men.",
            "Other risk factors include occupational exposures to suspected carcinogens, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), residential radon exposure, and genetic susceptibility.",
            "Numerous studies have examined the associations between occupational exposures and lung cancer risk, but only a few have explored these in lifelong nonsmoking men.",
            "Smoking is such a strong risk factor of lung cancer that its presence makes it difficulty to examine the effects of occupational exposures with weak to moderate carcinogenicity.",
            "Moreover, cigarette smoking may modify the effects of occupational exposures on lung cancer risk.",
            "As inadequate consideration of smoking can lead to inaccurate risk estimations, restriction of study subjects to lifelong nonsmokers offers the best way to examine the independent effects of occupational carcinogens.",
            "However, in most studies, lung cancers in lifelong nonsmokers are very few (<10%) to have high statistical power.",
            "We used a subgroup of lifelong nonsmokers from a large population-based case\u2013referent study to examine the independent effects of occupational exposures on the risk of all lung cancers combined as well as the histological subtype of adenocarcinoma among Chinese nonsmoking men.",
            "Materials and methods",
            "The recruitment of cases and referents of this population-based study has been described elsewhere.",
            "In brief, we recruited 1208 newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed primary lung cancer consecutively from the largest oncology centre in Hong Kong from 1 February 2004 to 30 September 2006, with a response rate of 96%.",
            "All the eligible cases were Chinese men aged 35\u201379 years.",
            "We recruited 1069 male community referents randomly selected from same districts of the cases, with a response rate of 48%, a response rate comparable with that of other similar studies.",
            "Each community referent from the original larger study was frequency matched in 5-year age groups to a lung cancer case, as the age distribution of the subgroup of lifelong nonsmoking cases may not be comparable with the nonsmoking referents.",
            "All community referents must have no history of physician-diagnosed cancer in any site.",
            "This study was approved by the ethics committees of both the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Queen Elizabeth Hospital.",
            "Personal interviews with the cases and referents were carried out by trained interviewers using structured questionnaires immediately after informed consent was obtained.",
            "A lifestyle questionnaire obtained information on demographic data, sources of indoor air pollutants (i.e. exposure to residential radon and ETS, incense burning, use of mosquito coils, and years of cooking by frying), habits of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking, dietary habits, past history of lung diseases, cancer history in first-degree relatives, and occupational exposures.",
            "Histological findings were retrieved from the hospital records.",
            "For this study, we selected the subgroup of never smokers defined by subjects who had never smoked as many as 20 packs of cigarettes or 12\u2009oz (342\u2009g) of tobacco in lifetime or one cigarette a day or one cigar a week for 1 year.",
            "A complete work history of jobs held at least 1 year was recorded for each case and referent.",
            "The work history included job title, job task description, and the beginning and end date of each job.",
            "Job titles and industries were coded according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) and International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), respectively, for international comparison.",
            "The whole process of coding was performed blinded to the disease status of subjects.",
            "Additional information on each worker\u2019s regular exposure to specific individual or group of agents from each workplace was captured based on a list of confirmed or suspected human carcinogens, including asbestos, arsenic, nickel, chromium, tars, asphalts, silica, spray painting, nonspray painting, pesticides, diesel engine exhaust, cooking fumes, welding fumes, and man-made mineral fibres.",
            "Regular exposure referred to exposure at least once a week for at least 6 months.",
            "We introduced the study as a general \u2018male health\u2019 study to both cases and referents to minimise the potential recall bias.",
            "We performed unconditional logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for lung cancer related to occupations, industries, and exposure to specific or group of agents.",
            "In building the model, we initially included various potential confounding factors into a \u2018base\u2019 model using a forward stepwise method; the variables that were statistically significant and finally retained in the \u2018base\u2019 model were age, place of birth, education level, residential radon exposure, past history of lung diseases, any cancer in first-degree relatives, and intake of meat.",
            "We then forced each occupational exposure (i.e. occupations, industries, and exposure to specific or group of agents) into the \u2018base\u2019 model to estimate the adjusted OR.",
            "Preliminary analyses were performed for major ISCO and ISIC groups; if elevated ORs (ever vs never exposed) were suggested, further analyses were conducted in the submajor groups.",
            "Two reference groups were applied to each comparison: (1) workers who had never worked in that occupation or industry or had never been exposed to that defined agent (or group of agents) and (2) workers who had never been exposed to any of the confirmed or suspected human carcinogens in the list.",
            "Analyses were carried out separately for adenocarcinoma \u2013 the most common histological type among nonsmokers (89 cases, 69.4% of all lung cancers).",
            "Results",
            "This study included 132 nonsmoking male cases and 536 nonsmoking male referents (Table 1).",
            "Cases were more likely to be alcohol drinkers, divorced, and exposed to ETS, but they were less educated and had lower family income; a statistical significance was only observed for family income.",
            "The mean age of cases was 2.2 years older than the referents (61.9 years) at the time of diagnosis.",
            "As described previously, we found that more cases were exposed to higher level of residential radon and had any cancer in first-degree relatives than the referents.",
            "The ORs of lung cancer for employment in major industries and occupations are presented in Table 2.",
            "After adjustment of residential radon exposure and other potential confounding factors, only workers ever employed as \u2018bricklayers, carpenters and other construction workers (ISCO code: 9\u20135)\u2019 showed a significantly increased OR of 2.25 (95% CI: 1.11, 4.54).",
            "Elevated ORs were also suggested for some other industries and occupations, but no statistical significance was observed.",
            "The ORs of lung cancer for occupational exposure to specific or group of agents are shown in Table 3.",
            "Significantly increased risk was associated with silica dust, painting, and diesel exhaust.",
            "Exposure to spray painting showed a 19% higher lung cancer risk than the nonspray painting work.",
            "An increased risk of lung cancer was associated with the increasing years of employment for workers exposed to silica dust and spray painting (Table 4).",
            "Separate analyses were repeated for the risk of adenocarcinoma (Tables 3 and 4).",
            "We found that a significant OR (2.91, 95% CI: 1.10, 7.68) was retained only for workers exposed to silica dust with an indication of exposure\u2013response relationship with duration of employment.",
            "A positive gradient was also observed for painting workers regardless of the process of spray.",
            "The risk estimates tended to be stronger when the reference group was replaced by a group of men who had never been exposed to any of the confirmed or suspected human carcinogens in the list (Tables 3 and 4).",
            "We further examined the correlation between occupational agents and found no obvious correlation between them (r=0.01\u20130.35).",
            "No important effect modification by exposure to ETS was identified for the associations between these defined occupational exposures and lung cancer.",
            "Discussion",
            "This population-based case\u2013referent study aimed to identify occupational exposures related to elevated risk of lung cancer among lifelong nonsmoking Chinese men in Hong Kong.",
            "We found that the groups with employment as \u2018bricklayers, carpenters, and other construction workers\u2019 or occupational exposure to silica dust, diesel exhaust, or painting were associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer.",
            "On account of the small number of subjects in each specific industry or occupation, we analysed risk in major industrial and occupational groups, and found an increased risk of lung cancer among men who had ever been employed as \u2018bricklayers, carpenters, and other construction workers\u2019.",
            "In Hong Kong, workers employed in construction and the related work accounts for around 9% of the local workforce, while employment as \u2018bricklayers, carpenters, and other construction workers\u2019 is the major occupation of local construction industry involving several job tasks, such as stone cutting, pneumatic drilling, caisson, tunnelling, dynamiting, rock sand blasting (already banned), stone crushing, cement machine attendant, bricklayer, decoration work, truck driving or operators of excavating machines, and unskilled labourers.",
            "These job tasks are frequently linked to several occupational hazards, in particular, silica dust, diesel exhausts, and painting work.",
            "All these occupational exposures are confirmed or suspected as associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.",
            "Crystalline silica dust has been reclassified as a human group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 1997, while its carcinogenicity has long been debated as potentially confounding the effect of smoking.",
            "We estimated the independent effect of silica dust in nonsmokers, thus avoiding this problem.",
            "A recently published multicentre case\u2013referent study in Europe found an OR of 1.76 (95% CI: 0.97, 3.21) in nonsmoking subjects who had ever been exposed to silica dust, and a higher OR in the longest duration of employment group (OR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.11, 5.15, based on 223 cases of which 48 were male) after adjustment of age, sex, and study centre.",
            "The same group of workers found an OR of 1.41 (95% CI: 0.79, 2.49) after redefining the nonexposure group as subjects not exposed to silica dust for >20 years before interview.",
            "We observed an OR of 2.58 among male workers ever exposed to silica dust and a positive association with increasing years of employment.",
            "We carried out a sensitivity analysis and found that the risk estimate was almost unchanged (OR=2.55, 95% CI: 1.14, 5.73) after redefining the nonsmoking status as that of the European study \u2013 a man who smoked <100 cigarettes in his lifetime.",
            "We further re-estimated the results by removing \u2018any cancer in first-degree relatives\u2019, \u2018past history of lung diseases\u2019, and \u2018meat intake\u2019 (these variables were not considered in Cassidy\u2019s study) from the model, and found that the OR was reduced by 6.2% (OR=2.42, 95% CI: 1.07, 5.49), but it was still higher than those reported by.",
            "Our study provides supportive evidence for an independent effect of crystalline silica on lung cancer risk among nonsmokers.",
            "About 18% of our nonsmoking lung cancer cases had been involved in painting work and majority of them were assigned in renovation work of construction or car renewals in which spray painting is frequently required.",
            "Employment as a painter has been listed as a human group 1 carcinogen; two recent reviews support the conclusion of IARC after assessing reports on painters published since 1951 and a weak association for lung cancer risk (1.22 and 1.36) was shown after controlling for smoking.",
            "Occupational exposure as a spray painter has been associated with an increased risk of urinary tract and testicular cancer, whereas its separate effect on lung cancer has not yet been reported.",
            "We found a slightly higher risk of lung cancer among painting workers using spray at work (OR=2.81) than general painters whose work never involved spraying (OR=2.36), suggesting exposure differences.",
            "Painting workers are commonly exposed by inhalation of solvents and paint dusts (e.g. silica dusts, asbestos dusts, and heavy metals), while spray painting workers may be additionally exposed to a variety of suspected carcinogens in the form of aerosol or fine particles, which can be readily absorbed deep into the lungs.",
            "Our positive association with years of employment as spray painters corroborates the IARC conclusion.",
            "Previous studies showed an average of 33% (95% CI: 24, 44%) excess risk of lung cancer among railroad workers and truck drivers occupationally exposed to diesel engine exhaust emissions, but were commonly criticised for the lack of reliable exposure assessment and inadequate control for smoking.",
            "The IARC evaluated diesel exhaust as a group 2A carcinogen because of the limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans.",
            "We observed an OR of 3.47 among nonsmoking men occupationally exposed to diesel exhaust, which is much higher than previously reported, but may well be as only six cases of lung cancer were exposed to diesel exhaust and there was no gradient with duration of employment.",
            "There have been few studies of occupation and histological types of lung cancer among lifelong nonsmoking men.",
            "Our study numbers allowed us to explore only the risk of adenocarcinoma (the commonest histological type), and among nonsmoking men, we found a slightly higher association with silica dust exposure (a significant OR retained), but a relatively lower OR for occupational exposure to painting and diesel exhaust than all lung cancer cases.",
            "The relatively wide CIs of many of risk estimates indicate our limited powers for investigating associations with adenocarcinoma risk, while the multiple comparisons point to the possibility that some significant results have occurred by chance.",
            "Accuracies in recall of nonsmoking status of our subjects (>0.95) and selection bias for the cases and community referents have been addressed in another paper about ETS and lung cancer.",
            "Misclassification of self-reported occupational exposures is a concern because the workers might not accurately identify the specific hazards in their working environments, but these are likely to be nondifferential between cases and referents, resulting in under-estimation of risk.",
            "Also, it is difficult to detangle the effects of different job tasks when workers were employed in several occupations during their lifetimes and thus potentially exposed to multiple chemical substances, which indeed may occur even if only one occupation was involved.",
            "We are aware that using \u2018ever exposure\u2019 might not be a good measurement to quantify the independent effect of an occupational exposure.",
            "This study is, therefore, only preliminary and needs confirmation.",
            "To further evaluate the potential recall and/or interviewer bias, we interviewed a subgroup of 45 proxy respondents (e.g. spouse) 2 months after the initial interview and found the overall agreement on occupational exposures was excellent (\u03ba=0.72).",
            "The test\u2013retest reliability for the same respondents was also very good for both cases (\u03ba=0.65) and referents (\u03ba=0.60).",
            "We further interviewed a special group of 64 inpatient referents (who had to undergo surgical operations for suspected lung cancer and were treated as lung cancer cases at the interviews, but eventually were diagnosed as not suffering from lung cancer) who showed a lower proportion of occupational exposures than the confirmed lung cancer cases, suggesting that any interviewer or recall bias was not a major issue.",
            "Our study found that men employed as \u2018bricklayers, carpenters, and other construction workers\u2019 and those who had ever been occupationally exposed to silica dust, diesel exhaust, and painting work were associated with an increased risk of all lung cancers, and the effects were independent of smoking."

            "Methods",
            "We exposed male DO mice to benzene (0, 1, 10, or 100 ppm; 75 mice/exposure group) via inhalation for 28 days (6 hr/day for 5 days/week).",

            "We measured micronuclei frequency in reticulocytes from peripheral blood and bone marrow and applied benchmark concentration modeling to estimate exposure thresholds.",

            "We observed a dose-dependent increase in benzene-induced chromosomal damage and estimated a benchmark concentration limit of 0.205 ppm benzene using DO mice.",

            "Introduction",
            "Benzene is a ubiquitous airborne pollutant that is classified as a carcinogen.",
            "Human exposure to benzene occurs mainly through inhalation in both environmental and occupational settings.",
            "The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set an 8-hr, time-weighted average exposure limit of 1 ppm.",
            "However, workers exposed to benzene at air concentrations < 1 ppm still show evidence of hematotoxicity.",
            "Occupational exposures as low as 0.3 ppm have been shown to increase the risk of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.",
            "At the molecular level, benzene exposure alters gene expression in peripheral blood cells, induces aneuploidy in hematopoietic progenitor cells, and induces chromosome damage in myeloid progenitor cells.",
            "These and a multitude of other effects including AhR dysregulation, reduced immunosurveillance, and oxidative stress probably lead to benzene-induced hematologic malignancies.",
            "Benzene metabolism and clearance varies significantly in the human population, and these differences may be influenced by both past or current co-exposures as well as genetic factors.",
            "Occupational studies of benzene exposure focusing on candidate genes have quantified the effects of polymorphisms on hematotoxicity and genotoxicity end points.",
            "However, the scope and impact of human genetic variation on toxicity responses remains poorly understood.",
            "Exposure thresholds for suspected toxicants are typically determined using animal models.",
            "One of the most common mouse models used in toxicology assessments at the NTP is the B6C3F1 mouse.",
            "These mice are derived by crossing two inbred strains\u2014C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ\u2014and, like identical twins, all B6C3F1 mice are genetically identical (i.e., isogenic).",

            "There are no recombination events in our DO mice in the duplication region that could help to distinguish the effects of Gm4794 from Sult3a1.",
            "Discussion",
            "Implications for BMC modeling.",
            "The current U.S. EPA\u2019s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) risk assessment benzene BMCL of 7.2 ppm is based on lymphocyte count data from 44 human subjects in an occupational exposure assessment.",
            "In 2004, the same research consortium observed that workers exposed to < 1 ppm benzene had reduced white blood cell counts and circulating hematopoietic stem cells, indicating that additional research is necessary to determine appropriate risk thresholds for benzene exposure.",
            "We performed BMC modeling on inhalation exposure data from DO mice and also on data from a previous study of B6C3F1 mice.",
            "Our estimated BMCL10 using DO mice, at 0.205 ppm benzene, was an order of magnitude lower than values obtained using B6C3F1 mice.",
            "The DO-based estimate of BMCL10 is consistent with observed exposure toxicity in human subjects and thus may provide a more appropriate starting point for establishing exposure thresholds that protect the most sensitive human subpopulations.",
            "There are several aspects in which our study may have improved inhalation exposure assessment for benzene.",
            "We examined exposure concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 100 ppm.",
            "In retrospect it would have been preferable to add an exposure between 10 and 100 ppm to evaluate the fit of the standard dose\u2013response model.",
            "In addition, because the estimated BMCL10 values fall below 1 ppm, an exposure group at a concentration between 0 and 1 ppm would increase our confidence in this estimate.",
            "However, low concentration exposures < 0.5 ppm are difficult to control in standard flow chambers.",
            "There may also be variation in respiration rates between DO mice and measuring the respiration rates may improve our ability to characterize the sources of variation in our study.",
            "In the analysis of our data, we followed U.S. EPA\u2013recommended guidelines for BMC modeling, but we encountered a number of problems.",
            "The significant lack of fit when the high-dose group was included suggested that the recommended models do not accurately reflect responses over the full range of exposures studied.",
            "Removing the high-exposure group data improved the overall model fit, but it would have been preferable to evaluate all of the data.",
            "In addition, when applying the recommended method for computing BMC, both our data and the B6C3F1 data failed to meet expectations implicit in the procedure.",
            "Extrapolation of risk estimates to low exposures is a challenging problem, and well-defined procedures are required to assure that consistent regulatory recommendations are provided.",
            "However, our experience in applying these procedures suggests that more research may be needed to identify new methods that conform to the realized properties of exposure\u2013response data.",
            "Advantages of DO mice in toxicology.",
            "The use of isogenic mice, such as B6C3F1, has been common practice for > 30 years.",
            "Isogenic lines are assumed to produce lower variance and thus require smaller sample sizes compared with genetically diverse mice.",
            "This appears to be an advantage.",
            "However, isogenic mice do not reflect the variation in toxicity responses that we expect in a genetically diverse population such as humans.",
            "Furthermore, inadvertent selection of a strain (or F1 hybrid) model with an idiosyncratic response could result in significant bias and compromise the reliability of BMC estimates.",
            "These results may challenge current paradigms in toxicology testing, but these data suggest implicit benefits in modeling genetically diverse populations of test organisms.",
            "The observed variation in MN-RETs in our study of DO mice was similar to isogenic B6C3F1 mice in the no-exposure group and ranged up to nine times greater (three times on SD scale) in the 100-ppm exposure conditions (see Supplemental Material, Table S3).",
            "There are difficulties in directly comparing studies that were carried out at different times and locations.",
            "However, we can obtain direct estimates of the genetic contribution to variance from the DO study.",
            "Heritability estimates suggest that sample sizes of DO mice required to obtain the same precision as with isogenic mice would need to be increased by a factor of three.",
            "The increased cost is offset by the potential to obtain more realistic and generalizable estimates of toxicity response in the genetically diverse populations.",
            "While it seems premature to make a general recommendation regarding sample sizes for DO-based toxicology studies, 75 animals per group is adequate to obtain reproducible estimates of BMC and BMCL.",
            "DO mice encompass much greater genetic diversity than the classical inbred strains and commercial outbred stocks.",
            "Randomized breeding and genetic monitoring are employed to ensure constant population allele frequencies over time.",
            "In addition, the Collaborative Cross strains provide a resource of reproducible inbred animals from the same genetic background as the DO.",
            "This genetic reference population could be useful for validation and mechanistic studies of results obtained in DO mice.",
            "In the present study the presence of CAST alleles on Chr 10 resulted in a significantly reduced response to benzene exposure.",
            "If, hypothetically, a mouse strain related to CAST had dominated mouse research in the same way that the C57BL/6 strain has, our assessment of exposure risk might look quite different.",
            "This illustrates the arbitrary nature of using a single inbred strain for exposure modeling.",
            "No single animal model can provide a perfect surrogate for evaluating toxicity in humans.",
            "However, the genetically diverse DO model provides a population-based assessment with levels of interindividual variation that more accurately reflect human populations.",
            "Identification of QTL associated with susceptibility to benzene exposure.",
            "Using 144 DO mice in the combined 100-ppm exposure groups, we identified a region on Chr 10 in which mice carrying at least one CAST allele showed decreased chromosomal damage after exposure.",
            "Two genes, Sult3a1 and Gm4794, showed increased hepatic expression in CAST/EiJ compared with other founder strains.",
            "We hypothesize that a genomic duplication specific to the CAST strain leads to increased expression of Sult3a1 and Gm4794 in the liver.",
            "These genes could play a protective role by sulfating benzene metabolites, such as phenol, before they can be transported to the bone marrow.",
            "In humans, sulfate conjugation of benzene metabolites such as phenol is thought to occur in the liver.",
            "Although humans lack a direct ortholog of Sult3a1, the human sulfotransferase with the closest amino acid similarity is a phenol sulfotransferase called SULT1A1.",
            "Humans contain between one and five copies of SULT1A1, and our results suggest that copy number variation could be associated with the variation in benzene-induced toxicity in humans.",
            "We did not find any significant association near genes that are traditionally associated with benzene metabolism\u2014such as Cyp2e1, Ephx1, Sult1a1, Mpo, and Nqo1\u2014in the 100-ppm exposure group.",
            "This may be due to a lack of functional polymorphisms in these genes in the DO, to the relative importance of these genes to benzene metabolism and clearance in the 100-ppm exposure group, or to differences in benzene metabolism between mice and humans.",
            "Conclusions",
            "We have demonstrated that DO mice experience a reproducible dose-dependent increase in bone marrow MN-RET after benzene exposure by inhalation.",
            "We carried out a standard BMC modeling analysis using the DO mice and found that BMCL10 estimates were lower by an order of magnitude compared with an isogenic mouse model.",
            "We used genetic mapping analysis of DO mice to identify a locus on Chr 10 that is associated with benzene-induced genotoxicity.",
            "Analysis of gene expression and genomic sequencing data provide evidence in support of sulfotransferases as candidate genes underlying the QTL effect."

            "Prenatal exposure to some pesticides can adversely affect male reproductive health in animals.",
            "We investigated a possible human association between maternal exposure to 27 organochlorine compounds used as pesticides and cryptorchidism among male children.",
            "Design",
            "Within a prospective birth cohort, we performed a case\u2013control study; 62 milk samples from mothers of cryptorchid boys and 68 from mothers of healthy boys were selected.",
            "Milk was collected as individual pools between 1 and 3 months postpartum and analyzed for 27 organochlorine pesticides.",
            "Results",
            "Eight organochlorine pesticides were measurable in all samples (medians; nanograms per gram lipid) for cases/controls: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p\u2032-DDE): 97.3/83.8; \u03b2-hexachlorocyclohexane (\u03b2-HCH): 13.6/12.3; hexachlorobenzene (HCB): 10.6/8.8; \u03b1 -endosulfan: 7.0/6.7; oxychlordane: 4.5/4.1; 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p\u2032-DDT): 4.6/4.0; dieldrin: 4.1/3.1; cis-heptachloroepoxide (cis-HE): 2.5/2.2. Five compounds [octachlorostyrene (OCS); pentachlorobenzene, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p\u2032-DDD); o,p\u2032-DDT; mirex] were measurable in most samples (detection rates 90.8\u201399.2%) but in lower concentrations.",
            "For methoxychlor, cis-chlordane, pentachloroanisole (PCA), \u03b3 -HCH, 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,2(4-chlorophenyl)ethane, trans-chlordane, \u03b1 -HCH, and o,p\u2032-DDE, both concentrations and detection rates were low (26.5\u201371.5%).",
            "Heptachlor, HCH (\u03b4, \u025b ), aldrin, \u03b2-endosulfan and trans-heptachloroepoxide were detected at negligible concentrations and low detection rates and were not analyzed further.",
            "Seventeen of 21 organochlorine pesticides [p,p\u2032-DDT, p,p\u2032-DDE, p,p\u2032-DDD, o,p\u2032-DDT, HCH (\u03b1 , \u03b2, \u03b3 ), HCB, PCA, \u03b1 -endosulfan, cis-HE, chlordane (cis-, trans-) oxychlordane, methoxychlor, OCS, and dieldrin] were measured in higher median concentrations in case milk than in control milk.",
            "Apart from trans-chlordane (p = 0.012), there were no significant differences between cryptorchid and healthy boys for individual chemicals.",
            "However, combined statistical analysis of the eight most abundant persistent pesticides showed that pesticide levels in breast milk were significantly higher in boys with cryptorchidism (p = 0.032).",
            "Conclusion",
            "The association between congenital cryptorchidism and some persistent pesticides in breast milk as a proxy for maternal exposure suggests that testicular descent in the fetus may be adversely affected.",
            "Studies published during the last decades have indicated that the birth prevalence of cryptorchidism may have increased in some regions.",
            "Genetic factors may contribute to these findings.",
            "However, the short time interval of this increase suggests that environmental factors may be important.",
            "Several organochlorine pesticides can cause adverse effects in the male reproductive system in animals.",
            "An increased incidence of cryptorchidism in male panthers has been attributed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the environment, such as 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p\u2032-DDE).",
            "In utero exposure of male rats and rabbits to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDT) resulted dose dependently in reduced anogenital distance, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and epididymal agenesis.",
            "Increased rates of orchidopexy in areas with extensive pesticide use in agriculture have been reported.",
            "One study also found higher pesticide levels in fat tissue samples from boys operated on for cryptorchidism than in children who were operated on for other reasons.",
            "The aim of this study was to investigate, in a case\u2013control study nested within a prospective cohort, whether individual in utero exposure to organochlorine pesticides estimated by measurements of maternal breast milk concentrations was associated with cryptorchidism among male children.",
            "Materials and Methods",
            "We conducted a joint prospective, longitudinal birth cohort study in Finland (Turku University Hospital) and Denmark (National University Hospital at Copenhagen) from 1997 to 2001.",
            "In this study we aimed to describe regional prevalence rates and risk factors (lifestyle and exposure) for cryptorchidism by means of questionnaires and biologic samples (blood samples of mother and child, placentas, and one breast milk sample per child).",
            "The study was prospectively planned by both research groups as a joint venture in 1996.",
            "Recruitment and examinations were completely standardized.",
            "The cohort (antenatal recruitment and inclusion, inclusion criteria, and clinical examinations) has been described previously in detail.",
            "All boys in the cohort were examined by a group of specially trained doctors for signs of cryptorchidism.",
            "The examination technique and definition of cryptorchidism developed by Scorer were applied.",
            "Standardization of the clinical procedures was achieved by repetitive workshops, and borderline cases were examined by two researchers from the national study groups.",
            "All boys were examined shortly after birth and again at 3 months of age.",
            "Boys born prematurely were examined at the expected date of delivery.",
            "From the total biobank of breast milk samples, we included 65 samples from each country for organochlorine pesticide measurements.",
            "The number of samples was determined by funding.",
            "The samples represent 29 Danish and 33 Finnish cases defined as boys with cryptorchidism (unilateral or bilateral) at birth.",
            "Four Danish and 25 Finnish boys were still cryptorchid at 3 months of age, whereas the others (25/8) had spontaneous descent.",
            "Danish/Finnish controls (36/32), defined as boys without cryptorchidism at birth or 3 months, were included.",
            "In Denmark, the controls were selected randomly from the entire birth cohort of healthy boys.",
            "In Finland, the boys were selected prospectively by a case\u2013control design in which the boys with cryptorchidism were matched to controls at birth for maternal parity, smoking (yes/no), diabetes (yes/no), gestational age (\u00b1 7 days), and date of birth (\u00b1 14 days).",
            "This design was chosen in Finland because of lack of sufficient funding to collect and store biologic samples from all.",
            "To ensure that all prospectively planned chemical analyses could be performed, only breast milk samples with a volume > 125 mL were included.",
            "The study was conducted according to the Helsinki II Declaration and was approved by the local ethical committees in both countries (Finland: 7/1996, Denmark: KF01-030/97) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (registration no. 1997-1200-074).",
            "The families were included after oral and written informed consent had been obtained from the parents.",
            "Human breast milk samples were collected from 1 to 3 months postpartum in Denmark and from 1 to 2 months postpartum in Finland as successive aliquots.",
            "All mothers were given oral and written instructions to feed the baby first and then sample milk aliquots (hind milk) by manual expression into a glass or porcelain container, avoiding the use of mechanical breast pumps.",
            "The aliquots were frozen consecutively in a glass bottle (250-mL Pyrex glass bottle with a Teflon cap (1515/06D, Bibby Sterilin, Staffordshire, England) and stored in household freezers.",
            "The samples were delivered frozen to the hospital at the 3 months\u2019 examination and stored at \u201320\u00b0C.",
            "Exposure measurements in biologic samples from boys with congenital cryptorchidism at birth and controls were prospectively planned to include persistent and nonpersistent chemicals.",
            "Twenty-seven organochlorine compounds were selected by the following criteria: previous worldwide use, suspicion of endocrine-disrupting activity from animal and/or in vitro studies, and highly sensitive analytic methods available.",
            "As part of other substudies, the same breast milk samples were planned to be analyzed for other compounds with suspected endocrine-disrupting activity.",
            "The selected breast milk samples were thawed at room temperature for 12 hr, heated, and shaken for 30 min at 37\u00b0C to homogenize the samples, and then divided into smaller aliquots and refrozen at \u201320\u00b0C until further chemical analysis.",
            "Extraction, cleanup, and analysis of organochlorine pesticides in the milk samples were based on a method that has been described in detail elsewhere.",
            "Milk samples (10 mL) were extracted with 250 mL of a mixture consisting of acetone and n-hexane (2:1 v/v).",
            "The milk extracts were collected in flasks weighed in advance and evaporated using a rotary vacuum evaporator (water bath at 45\u00b0C).",
            "After evaporation, the flasks were placed into an exicator until stable weight was achieved.",
            "The lipid content was calculated on wet weight basis.",
            "The residual was dissolved in toluene, and gel permeation-chromatography followed by sandwich cartridge cleanup was used to remove lipids and other interferences from the extract.",
            "Finally, the organochlorine pesticides were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry quantified by an isotope dilution method.",
            "Statistical Analysis",
            "Descriptive data of the mothers and the boys (anthropometric measurements) are reported as mean \u00b1 SD or number (percentage) (Table 1).",
            "We tested differences between boys with and without cryptorchidism by unpaired t-tests or chi-square tests.",
            "Descriptive statistics of pesticide concentrations are given as medians and ranges (minimum and maximum) because of skewed distributions.",
            "The sum of DDT metabolites was calculated as the sum of all six metabolites.",
            "We calculated the DDE(dichloro-diphenyldichloroethylene)/DDT ratio and the enantiomeric median ratio (ER) by simple division: p,p\u2032-DDE/1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p\u2032-DDT) and (+)-isomer concentration/(\u2013)-isomer concentration for the individual compounds, respectively.",
            "We tested the differences between cryptorchid and healthy boys using the Mann-Whitney U-test.",
            "We tested the differences in pesticide levels between cryptorchid and healthy boys using a logistic regression model in which the pesticide level (log-transformed) and, in some analyses, country and other potential confounders were entered as covariates.",
            "This approach had the advantage of allowing the inclusion of cases and controls based on their pesticide levels in the analysis.",
            "This selection does not introduce bias in the estimation.",
            "p-Values were not corrected for multiple testing.",
            "To determine whether a given measurement of a sample indicated the presence of a pesticide, both the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were determined for every sample.",
            "We defined the LOD as three times the background noise of the analytic instrument.",
            "Samples with values below the LOD were nondetectable.",
            "Samples above LOD, in which the pesticide concentration could not be reliably quantified, were assigned a value below the LOQ; the LOQ represents the level at which a compound concentration was determined with sufficient precision.",
            "We defined the LOQ as three times the value of a blank sample, which was the blank matrix used in sample preparation.",
            "Detection rate was defined as percentage of samples with a detectable and quantifiable value.",
            "Because statistical handling of measurements below the LOD or below the LOQ may influence results, we tried different selection schemes to test whether conclusions were sensitive to the actual values of the unquantifiable measurements.",
            "We performed three analyses to compare the exposures of cryptorchid and normal boys.",
            "The first included all data using the LOD for samples with nondetectable values and the detected value for unquantified samples.",
            "The second included all data except for samples with values below the LOQ.",
            "The third analysis excluded all nondetectable samples.",
            "Exposure levels reported in Table 2 are based on the third analysis excluding samples with values below the LOD or below the LOQ.",
            "Exposure patterns between cases and controls using the other two statistical approaches did not substantially differ from those in Table 2 (data not shown).",
            "To investigate a combined effect of persistent pesticides, we used eight pesticides for which all individuals had measurable and quantifiable levels [p,p\u2032-DDE, p,p\u2032-DDT, \u03b2-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), hexa-chlorobenzene (HCB), \u03b1 -endosulfan, cis-heptachloroepoxide (cis-HE), oxychlordane, and dieldrin].",
            "A statistical test of the null hypothesis that there were no differences in the median exposure levels of cases and controls was carried out as a Monte Carlo permutation test.",
            "In the permutations, cases and controls were randomly assigned exposure profiles from the observed profiles, and median levels between cases and controls were compared within countries.",
            "We then compared the observed test statistic (the number of median exposures, which were higher among cases than controls) with the permutation distribution.",
            "The permutation scheme of the test takes into account the within-individual association structure between different persistent organochlorine pesticides\u2014that some individuals tend to have high exposure to many pesticides, whereas others have low exposures.",
            "Results",
            "Study population characteristics are given in Table 1.",
            "We found no significant differences between the mothers giving birth to a cryptorchid boy versus a healthy boy.",
            "Gestational age of cryptorchid boys was slightly lower than in normal boys (Denmark: p = 0.029; Finland: p = 0.688).",
            "No systematic difference between cases and controls with regard to year of birth was observed (p = 0.543).",
            "In both countries, the selected controls did not differ from the healthy mothers and boys in the entire cohorts with respect to maternal age, parity, smoking, gestational age, and birth weight (data not shown).",
            "Table 2 shows the results of pesticide measurements in breast milk samples of mothers with cryptorchid and normal boys.",
            "The lipid content (percent weight per weight) did not differ significantly (p = 0.707) between cases [3.7 (range, 1.1\u20137.9)] and controls [3.8 (range, 0.4\u201310.1)].",
            "Concentrations of persistent pesticides (nanograms per gram lipid) in breast milk showed large interindividual variations and skewed distributions as well as differences in absolute levels.",

            "The concentrations of these eight compounds were higher than those of any of the remaining 19 compounds, which were all measured in very low concentrations.",
            "The sum of all DDT metabolites was slightly higher for cases than controls, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.",
            "The ratio between p,p\u2032-DDE and p,p\u2032-DDT was higher among controls than cases, but not significantly.",
            "Seventeen of 21 organochlorine pesticides [p,p\u2032-DDT; p,p\u2032-DDE; 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p\u2032-DDD); 1,1,1-trichloro-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chloropheny l)ethane (o,p\u2032-DDT); HCH (\u03b1 , \u03b2, \u03b3 ); HCB; pentachloroanisole (PCA); \u03b1 -endosulfan; cis-HE; chlordane (cis-, trans-); oxychlordane; methoxychlor; octachlorostyrene (OCS); and dieldrin] were measured in slightly higher median concentrations in milk from mothers giving birth to cryptorchid boys than in mothers giving birth to healthy boys with only trans-chlordane reaching statistical significance (p = 0.012) (Table 2).",

            "None of these six pesticides are included in Table 2.",
            "For the remaining eight compounds [methoxychlor, cis-chlordane, PCA, \u03b3 -HCH, 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,2(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (o,p\u2032-DDD), trans-chlordane, \u03b1 -HCH, 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (o,p\u2032-DDE)], the total detection rate varied between 26.9 and 71.5%.",
            "Detection rates did not differ significantly between cases and controls for single pesticides (data not shown).",
            "For oxychlordane and cis-HE, the enantiomeric concentrations were available.",
            "The absolute concentrations of the enantiomeric isomers were higher, but not significantly, for cryptorchid boys than for controls (data not shown).",
            "The ER for oxychlordane (cases/controls) was 1.36/1.28.",
            "For cis-HE, the corresponding figures were 2.48/2.19 (p = 0.103 and p = 0.467, respectively).",
            "Discussion",
            "Most persistent organochlorine pesticides were found in higher concentrations in boys with cryptorchidism than in controls, although no individual compound was significantly correlated with cryptorchidism.",
            "For eight chemicals (p,p\u2032-DDE, p,p\u2032-DDT, \u03b2-HCH, HCB, \u03b1 -endosulfan, cis-HE, oxychlordane, and dieldrin), which were measurable in all samples, the differences between cases and controls were unlikely to be due to chance.",
            "Although we cannot exclude the possibility that individual chemicals alone may cause cryptorchidism, our study suggests that exposure to more than one chemical at low concentrations represents a risk factor for congenital cryptorchidism.",
            "There may also be simultaneous coexposure to other environmental chemicals that contribute to the effect on testicular descent; the pesticide measurements may represent a proxy marker (sentinel) for other exposures, such as brominated flame retardants.",
            "We were able to quantify most organochlorine pesticides at low levels in breast-milk samples.",
            "This indicates that these chemicals are still relevant despite the fact that most have been banned or restricted in the study areas for many years.",
            "High DDE/DDT levels support the assumption the current exposure level primarily originates from previous contamination, environmental persistence, and long-range atmospheric dissipation, and less from imported food products and increased traveling activity to areas with ongoing use of pesticides such as DDT for malaria control.",
            "Levels of the investigated pesticides have generally declined in the study area, whereas the birth prevalence of cryptorchidism appears to have increased.",
            "This may explain why no single compound was strongly correlated with cryptorchidism.",
            "However, low concentrations of a mixture of chemicals over time may still be harmful to the fetus.",
            "In addition, the overall exposure to other chemicals with endocrine-disrupting activity may have increased in the same period.",
            "Thus, the persistent pesticides investigated here may reflect current overall exposure: Women with the highest levels of persistent pesticides may also be the ones with the highest concentrations of other endocrine-disrupting chemicals.",
            "This hypothesis is supported by a previous study that found the concentrations of HCB, p,p\u2032-DDE, p,p\u2032-DDT, and \u03b2-HCH in individual samples increased with increasing poly-chlorinated biphenyl concentrations.",
            "To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared levels of persistent organochlo-rine pesticides in breast milk with the birth prevalence of cryptorchidism.",
            "Breast milk was chosen as a surrogate biomarker of previous maternal exposure to persistent pesticides because these compounds accumulate in lipid-rich tissue and thereby in breast milk.",
            "There is a dynamic equilibrium between levels of persistent compounds in maternal adipose tissue and breast milk; therefore, daily intake of pesticides during lactation has little influence on the levels measured in milk.",
            "Both human and animal studies have demonstrated that pesticides during pregnancy can be transferred to the fetus by crossing the placenta.",
            "Levels measured in breast milk were positively correlated to levels measured in umbilical cord samples.",
            "Concentrations of compounds in breast milk are a suitable proxy for fetal exposure during pregnancy.",
            "As persistent pesticides are accumulated in the lipid fraction of the breast milk, any variations in the lipid content may affect the levels measured.",
            "In our study, the women were carefully instructed to collect only hind milk, and they collected many small aliquots that were pooled over time.",
            "Thus, the breast milk samples in this study represent an average content over a long period.",
            "Because we found no differences in mean lipid content between cases and controls, the potential bias induced by lipid variation due to collection is negligible.",
            "In both countries, the selected controls did not differ from the healthy mothers and boys in the entire cohorts with respect to maternal age, parity, smoking, gestational age, and birth weight, and therefore we believe that the samples are representative.",
            "Because of matching for the most common confounders, such as parity, in the Finnish population, there were no significant differences between cases and controls.",
            "In the Danish group, only gestational age differed slightly (p = 0.029).",
            "Primiparae, slim women, and smokers tend to have higher pesticide levels.",
            "As more mothers of healthy boys were primiparae and nonsmokers and had lower mean body mass index (BMI) than mothers of cryptorchid boys, our study may underestimate the effect of organochlorine pesticide exposure on cryptorchidism.",
            "No definitive relation between maternal age and the level of organochlorine pesticides in breast milk has been reported; some studies have found that older mothers have higher levels, whereas others have not.",
            "In our study, case mothers were slightly older than control mothers, but fewer of them were primiparae.",
            "Older mothers had higher concentrations [significant difference in three compounds (p,p\u2032-DDE, oxychlordane, and \u03b1 -endosulfan)].",
            "However, older primiparae mothers [n = 7:3 cases (4.8%); 4 controls (5.9%)] especially contributed to this difference.",
            "Because they were equally distributed in the two groups, this cannot explain the difference between cases and controls.",
            "Milk from mothers giving birth to premature babies may be different in composition.",
            "One Danish study described higher levels of HCB in milk from mothers giving birth to premature infants.",
            "In our study, levels were higher in milk from mothers giving birth to premature infants.",
            "The differences were not significant, and the number of premature infants was low (five cases and two controls) and cannot therefore explain the difference we found.",
            "The sensitivity of the analytic method allowed the detection of traces of organochlorine pesticides below the LOQ.",
            "This phenomenon was, as expected, most frequent for pesticides detected in generally low concentrations.",
            "Because the statistical handling of these measurements can profoundly change the results, we evaluated our data carefully with different approaches and found that the overall findings remained unchanged.",
            "Few other studies have investigated the possible relationship between persistent pesticide levels in biologic samples and the prevalence of cryptorchidism.",
            "compared levels of pesticides [DDT and metabolites, toxaphene, HCH (\u03b1 , \u03b2, \u03b3 ), HCB, PCA, PeCB, and several chlorinated cyclodienes such as heptachlor] in fat biopsies from 18 cryptorchid boys and 30 controls.",
            "Their findings were comparable with ours: Pesticide concentrations were higher among cases than controls, but reaching significance for only a few (HCB and heptachloroepoxide).",
            "However, the relatively limited total number of samples and especially the broad age range of boys (0.1\u201315 years) limits the interpretation of the data.",
            "For some participants, biomonitoring was conducted a long time after the relevant prenatal exposure window for testicular maldescent.",
            "Two studies have been published comparing levels of DDE and DDT in maternal blood and cryptorchidism and hypospadias in the offspring based on two large birth cohorts conducted in the United States in the 1960s.",
            "Although both studies were based on biologic samples collected in a period during which DDT was still being used, neither study found firm associations.",
            "did not find any association.",
            "found adjusted odd ratios to be elevated, although not significantly, and concluded that the results were consistent with a modest to moderate association between DDE/DDT and cryptorchidism.",
            "Both studies were performed as nested case\u2013control studies within large prospective birth cohort studies; the women were recruited during pregnancy and the diagnosis of cryptorchidism was well ascertained.",
            "Although these studies applied a different biologic matrix (blood) than ours (breast milk), the concentrations in ours were lower.",
            "This would also be expected, as the samples in both studies were collected in the period from 1959 to 1966, when DDT was still permitted.",
            "Other studies without access to biologic samples have also reported associations between cryptorchidism and parental pesticide exposure.",
            "Most of these studies were register-based and retrospective.",
            "One was performed as a nested case\u2013control study in a large birth cohort study comparing parental exposure (registered by interview of the parents after birth) among boys with cryptorchidism and hypospadias with the exposure of parents of normal boys.",
            "conducted an ecologic study in which orchidopexy rates in different municipalities in Granada, Spain, were compared.",
            "Pesticide use was categorized into four groups; areas with high pesticide exposure had higher orchidopexy rates.",
            "Generally, the exposure assessment was indirect and based on job titles, pesticide purchase, or self-reported exposure with the possibility of recall bias in case\u2013control studies.",
            "Distinction between maternal and paternal exposure is made only in some studies: found that cryptorchidism was significantly associated with paternal pesticide exposure but not maternal.",
            "described a significantly increased risk of cryptorchidism in sons of female gardeners.",
            "Finally, found increased risk with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy (relative risk = 4.6); however, this did not reach significance.",
            "Because most of these studies have been conducted recently, the pesticide exposure may reflect newer, nonpersistent pesticides.",
            "In addition, register data of cryptorchidism are less reliable because of variation in ascertainment and reporting.",
            "We found a large interindividual difference in concentrations of pesticides in breast milk.",
            "This was most likely related to individual differences in exposure and metabolism.",
            "Although no significant difference in factors such as lipid content in breast milk, maternal age, maternal BMI, parity, and smoking habits were found between the mothers of cryptorchid and healthy boys, these factors may have contributed to some of the interindividual differences.",
            "Compared with previous reports on Danish and Finnish breast milk, the average levels of persistent pesticides found in our study were low.",
            "This finding agrees with other reports on declining concentration of some persistent chemicals.",
            "The ERs indicated to what extent the chiral persistent pollutants were metabolized in the mother\u2019s body after the exposure, for example, because (\u2013)-cis-HE is more readily degraded than (+)-cis-HE in the human body; and if the two samples have the same levels of cis-HE with different ERs, the higher ER sample could have been exposed more heavily in the past.",
            "It is an interesting result that the case samples have higher levels of cis-HE with higher ERs (medians).",
            "This means, considering the already metabolized part, that case mothers should have been exposed to cis-HE more heavily than control mothers in their exposure histories.",
            "The most recent data (1993\u20131994) from the Danish National Board of Health (DNBH) of breast milk samples from 86 primiparae 25\u201329 years of age showed median concentrations of 178, 38, 33, and 8 ng/g lipid for p,p\u2032-DDE, \u03b2-HCH, HCB, and dieldrin, respectively.",
            "In our study, the corresponding figures were 135, 16, 12, and 5 ng/g lipid for primiparae of the same age.",
            "DNBH estimated that the average daily intake of p,p\u2032-DDE by the child was 1.1 \u03bcg/kg/day; in our study, the corresponding value was 0.7 \u03bcg/kg/day.",
            "This value is still above the acceptable daily intake/tolerable daily intake (ADI/TDI) suggested in the same report (0.5 \u03bcg/kg/day).",
            "For \u03bc-HCH, HCB, and dieldrin, estimated average daily intake in our study (0.09, 0.07, 0.03 \u03bcg/kg/day) was below the recommended ADI/TDI (0.6, 0.17, and 0.05 \u03bcg/kg/day).",
            "In contrast to a Finnish study from 1988 in which mirex was not detected in any of the milk samples, we were able to measure mirex in all samples, although in low concentrations.",
            "This difference could be due to our more sensitive analytic methods.",
            "To our knowledge, data on endosulfan, PCA, and PeCB in Danish and Finnish milk samples have not been published before.",
            "The levels were low compared with studies from other industrialized countries.",
            "In this study we focused on pesticides with suspected endocrine-disrupting activity or pesticides that have been used worldwide.",
            "The relative potency of each pesticide is often much lower than that of natural hormones.",
            "However, several of the included compounds act as both estrogens and antiandrogens, which might increase their possible adverse effect on testicular descent.",
            "Furthermore, different compounds may interact, thereby enhancing their effects.",
            "Existing data on possible mixture effects of the specific organochlorine pesticides in vitro are limited.",
            "A combination of 10 compounds including endosulfan, dieldrin, methoxychlor, and some DDT metabolites demonstrated a cumulative effect.",
            "Similarly, a number of studies have found indications of additivity for some of the pesticides included in our study.",
            "Others have not been able to demonstrate additivity between dieldrin and endosulfan or methoxychlor.",
            "Investigating the possible effects of mixtures is complicated because mechanisms of actions for individual compounds are often poorly known, and some chemicals may act through different routes depending on dosage.",
            "In conclusion, our study suggests an association between congenital cryptorchidism and some persistent organochlorine pesticides present in mothers\u2019 breast milk.",
            "Although our study cannot provide proof for a causal relationship, our data are in line with results from animal studies.",
            "Thus, prenatal exposure to persistent organochlorine pesticides may adversely affect testicular descent in boys."

            "ON THE DEATH RATES FROM CANCER OF THE STOMIACH AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN 1949-53 AMONG COAL MINERS AND OTHER AIALE RESIDENTS IN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND AND WALES",
            "IN a study of \" The Effects of Occupation and of its Accompanying Environ- ment on Mortality \" (Stocks, 1938)  a comparison was made between death rates from respiratory disease during 1921-23 among coal miners and other people living in different mining areas to ascertain whether the mortality excess which had been apparent in miners of South WVales and Lancashire when compared with miners in the Midlands arose from specific working conditions or from local factors affecting all residents in the counties concerned.",
            "It was found for example that at ages 45-64 the rates in Glamorgan and Monmouth combined showed the following ratios to those in Nottingham and Derby counties:",
            "Hewers and Getters Non-miners (male)   Femlales",
            "From this and other examples it was pointed out that \" faulty conclusions may be drawn from occupational statistics alone unless consideration is given to local variations in general mortality \".",
            "The mortality of wives of men with different occupations can be a useful control for the men's rates, but for some diseases the environmental factors most affecting incidence are not the same in the two sexes and some occupational hazards are extended to the home and affect the wife also.",
            "Furthermore the Registrar General's analyses of married women's mortality in 1930-32 and 1949-53  applied to the country as a whole and have not permitted subdivision by occupa- tion of husband in different parts of the country.",
            "It is possible, however, to compare death rates of coal miners between ages 20 and 65 with those of non- miners of the same ages in whole counties or groups of contiguous counties where there are coalfields, and the present study aims at doing this for cancer of the stomach and respiratory diseases.",
            "Mortality of Miner8 in Different Coalfields",
            "According to the occupational mortality statistics for 1949-53 (Registrar  General, 1958, Table DZ) there were six conditions which produced in coal miners (codes 042-049) a standardized rate at ages 20-64 15 per cent or more in excess of that of all males taken as 100, namely: pneumoconiosis (1277), cancer of stomach (149), bronchitis (135), chronic endocarditis not specified as rheumatic (146), myocardial degeneration without mention of coronary or rheumatic disease (127) and respiratory tuberculosis (119).",
            "For three of these the deaths of all males in each county and county borough are given annually in the Statistical Reviews of the Registrar General, and the numbers at ages 20-64 in 1949-53  have been estimated from the age grouping given for years 1950 and 1951.",
            "The deaths of coal miners at those ages from all non-violent causes totalled 14, 19in the 5 years compared with 13,546 expected from the national rates for all males, and out of the total excess of 1073 cancer of the stomach, bronchitis and respira- tory tuberculosis accounted for 948.",
            "The numbers of deaths registered from those causes, 969, 1540 and 1405 respectively, were large enough to allow subdivision according to separate coal fields.",
            "In Table EC of the Occupational Mortality report where such subdivision is made by causes for miners aged 20-64, and after combining Durham with Northumberland and the coalfields covering parts of Derbyshire and Staffordshire, the total deaths from all causes were: South-west Wales 525, Glamorgan 3296, Monmouth 1001, Durham-Northumberland 4368, Cheshire-Lancashire 1546, Yorkshire West Riding 3295, Stafford-Shropshire- Worcestershire 1171, Nottingham 1053, Derbyshire-Leicester-Warwick 1542 and a number of small areas with 986.",
            "Table I shows the census populations of coal miners (codes 042-049) and numbers of deaths from the three causes at ages 20-64 in the 10 divisions and in the country as a whole, with standardized mortality ratios (S.M.R.) in terms of all males in England and Wales taken as 100.",
            "For cancer of the stomach the S.M.R. of all coal miners in the country was 149; and wives of coal miners showed a similar excess over all married women, their S.M.R. being 154.",
            "In the different areas the miners' S.M.R.'s ranged from 200 in south-west Wales to 101 in Derby- Leicester-Warwick, but these differences take no account of areal differences there may be in the mortality of non-miners also.",
            "This poses the problem whether the areal contrasts arose from differences in the coal itself or manner of mining it, in the rock and soil containing it or in the general environment of the districts where the miners lived.",
            "It is necessary first to know whether non-miners living in the counties embracing the coalfields showed similar contrasts in stomach cancer mortality; and the reason for the enhanced mortality of miners' wives in the country as a whole has also to be considered.",
            "For bronchitis amongst all coal miners in England and Wales the S.M.R. was 135, and amongst their wives it was 175 in terms of the ratio for all married women taken as 100.",
            "For the South Wales and Monmouthshire miners however the S.M.R.'s were over 170 contrasted with Durham-Northumberland, Nottingham and Derbyshire-Leicester-Warwick miners with 115 or less.",
            "For respiratory tuberculosis the S.M.R. for all miners was 119 (wives 145) but Glamorgan and Monmouth miners showed ratios over 180 whereas in the northern and midland areas mentioned above the ratios were below 100.",
            "For these diseases also the question arises whether in 1949-53 similar areal differences occurred in non- miners.",
            "The levels of pneumoconiosis mortality are dealt with in Table III.",
            "Miortality in Equivalent Population of Non-Miners",
            "For each of the counties concerned and each county borough in them, the num- bers of deaths of males at all ages from the three diseases were obtained from the Statistical Reviews for 1949-53, and the numbers at ages 20-64 were estimated by means of the subdivision into age-groups shown in 1950 and 1951.",
            "Since some of the miners lived in the county boroughs it was necessary first to calculate an equivalent population of all males of those ages distributed between the adminis- trative county and each county borough in the same proportions as were the miners, since otherwise the control population of non-miners would contain a larger proportion living in large towns.",
            "For this purpose the General Register Office kindly supplied the numbers of coal miners aged 20-64 resident in each county borough at the census of 1951, and the populations of miners in separate mining areas shown in Table EC of the Occupational Mortality report were then divided between the administrative county or counties in which the area was situated and the individual county boroughs.",
            "Thus the proportions of miners resident in each constituent part of the total geographical county area embracing a coalfield could be calculated and the same proportions used to construct the control population.",
            "For example, in Glamorganshire, of the 52,672 coal miners 47,409 lived in the administrative county, 4396 in Merthyr Tydfil, 723 in Swansea and 144 in Cardiff, so the population from which they were drawn and the non- miners in it had to be distributed in the same proportions per unit total, namely 0.900, 0-083, 0-014 and 0 003 respectively, which are the \" weights \"w0, w1,w2,w3",
            "for this county.",
            "The crude death rate from cancer of the stomach at ages 20-64 in the total equivalent population, denoted by R, was obtained by weighting the death rates of all men at those ages in the administrative county by w0 and the rates in the various county boroughs by w1, W2, W3 . . and aggregating the weighted rates.",
            "For example, in the 4 parts of Glamorganshire the death rates per million were 379, 446, 350 and 385, producing a weighted rate R = 383 (compared with 373 in the whole of the population unweighted).",
            "If P0 is the population of men aged 20-64 in the administrative county, the total equivalent population to match the miners is P P0/w0, and deducting the miners in the whole coal- field, p, as given in Table I, the equivalent population of non-miners is p' _ P -p.",
            "Denoting the death rates at 20-64 among miners by r and among non-miners by r', the rate among non-miners is given by r' = (PR -pr)/p'.",
            "In the Glamorgan example P0o 219,211, leading to P = 243,568, and deducting the miners' p' is 190,896; the miners' rate r, derived from Table I by dividing their deaths by 5 times the census population, was 589 per million and R as found above was 383, so the non-miners' rate r' = 326 per million.",
            "Table I shows for each area the values of p, and r is given by the deaths/5 p. Table II shows the proportion of coal miners who lived in county boroughs (1 -wo) and the ratio of miners to total equivalent population (p/P) and from these P, P0 and p' can be derived.",
            "The weighted death rate R is also shown and the non-miners' rate r' can be found by means of the formula given above.",
            "The rates r in miners and r' in non-miners at ages 20-64 have now to be ad- justed for differences in age distribution within that range, using an indirect method of standardization, since there are larger proportions of young men in the town populations and also among coal miners than in the administrative county areas where most miners live.",
            "For example, in Glamorganshire the percentages of males aged 20-34 in the totals aged 20-64 were 36 in Cardiff, 35 in Swansea, 34 in Merthyr Tydfil, 32 in all coal miners and 26 in the administrative county, and few deaths from stomach cancer occur at such early ages.",
            "To adjust for this the miners' population p at each age group 20-, 25-, 35-, 45-, 55-64 was multiplied by the corresponding national death rates for all males in 1949-53 (3, 16, 91, 361, 1000 per million respectively for stomach cancer) giving the ex- pected death rate at 20-64.",
            "This when divided into the corresponding rate in England and Wales population (268) per million) gave the comparability factor for miners in that area, which when multiplied by r gave the age-adjusted rate, as shown in Table II.",
            "The population aged 20-64 of the administrative county, P0, and the equivalent populations in the separate county boroughs were each distributed between the age groups proportionately to the census populations of the area in question, and from the aggregate in all the areas in each age group the number of coal miners of that age was deducted, giving the age distribution of p' from which its comparability factor for stomach cancer was derived in the same way as for the miners.",
            "For bronchitis the national rates similarly used for age adjustment were 6, 14, 76, 510, 2083 per million at the 5 age groups and 470 at 20-64; and for respiratory tuberculosis they were 195, 314, 380, 631, 947 and 490.",
            "Comparison of Death Rates in Miners and Non-miners Cancer of stomach",
            "Table II gives the death rate, R, per million in the equivalent population of miners and non-miners, the comparability factors and age adjusted rates in miners and non-miners separately and the difference between those rates.",
            "In every area the coal miners' rate exceeds that of non-miners, the average difference being 126 per million, with a range from 65 to 226.",
            "It would appear from this that coal mining involves an occupational risk of increased mortality from stomach cancer, but the amount of the increase shows pronounced geographical differences.",
            "The greatest excess in the rate shown by miners over non-miners occurs in Brech- nock, Carmarthen and Pembroke, where it is 226 per million, and this area is peculiar in that 82 per cent of the miners were working anthracite at the time of the census.",
            "Warwick",
            "Proceeding from west to east in South Wales, the character of the coal changes from anthracite to seam coal and then to \" bituminous \" household coal at the Monmouth end.",
            "In Glamorganshire anthracite was worked by only 13 per cent of the miners, and the miners as a whole show a mortality excess of 195 per million.",
            "These counties of South Wales have enhanced rates of stomach cancer in the general population, the comparative mortality figures of both sexes in their rural districts in the years 1921-49, having been 155 in Carmarthen, 138 in Pembroke, 133 in Glamorgan and 117 in Brecknock, compared with 100 for all rural areas of England and Wales (Stocks, 1958).",
            "This is indicated by the non-miners' rates which are well above the corresponding national rate of 268 per million.",
            "It has been found that in North Wales where mortality from stomach cancer is peculiarly high, farmers, quarry workers in slate and igneous rock and coal miners all showed pronounced excess in age adjusted death rates from stomach cancer compared with men in other occupations, and this suggested that direct contact with soil in areas with high mortality may be a factor of importance (Stocks, 1961).",
            "It may be therefore that the notably large mortality excess in the South Wales miners is connected with the kind of rock and soil rather than, or in addition to, the kind of coal.",
            "In Monmouthshire the miners' excess was 157 per million; and combining the 3 Welsh areas the weighted non-miners' rate was 308 and the miners' excess was 200.",
            "In the Durham-Northumberland area the death rate of non-miners was 23 per cent above the national average of 268, and the miners' excess was 103.",
            "Taking the 3 northern areas together the weighted rate in non-miners was 281 and the miners' excess was 104, whilst in the 3 Midland areas combined the noinminers' rate was 289 and the miners' excess 72.",
            "There is a strong regional dif- ference in the occupational hazard, but whether the coal itself or kind of soil or both are responsible for the differences is uncertain.",
            "Another puzzling fact is that in all the mining areas combined, the wives of coal miners show a mortality excess from stomach cancer of about 50 per cent compared with all married women in England and Wales (Registrar General, 1958), but no regional subdivision of their death is available.",
            "If the non-miners' rates in Table II are weighted by the miners' populations the overall rate is 294 per million, which shows that in the coalfield areas as a whole, stomach cancer mortality of men aged 20-64 is about 10 per cent above that of all males in England and Wales.",
            "A similar excess in wives of non-miners could be expected in those areas.",
            "There remains a considerable excess in miners' wives which might be due to something in the homes of coal miners not usually found to the same extent in other homes, such as coal dust.",
            "Respiratory diseases",
            "It is evident from the Registrar General's occupational mortality statistics for 1949-53 that the risks of dying from cancer of the lung and bronchus are smaller among coal miners than among non-miners, since their mortality compared with that of all males taken as 100 was only 71 at ages 20-64 and 59 at ages 65 and over.",
            "In every one of the mining areas distinguished in this paper the S.M.R. was below 100.",
            "Table I shows that coal miners' mortality from bronchitis at ages 20-64 measured by the S.M.R. with all males in England and Wales taken as 100 was 135 in the whole country, but it varied regionally.",
            "In South Wales areas it ranged from 173 to 211, in northern areas from 115 to 147 and in the midland areas from 85 to 122.",
            "For respiratory tuberculosis the overall S.M.R. was 119, and in the South Wales areas it ranged from 143 to 184, in the north from 95 to 113 and in the midlands from 74 to 126.",
            "Table III compares age adjusted rates of miners with those of non-miners in the same counties by the same technique as for stomach cancer.",
            "The com- parability factors differ for each cause of death but have not been shown in the table.",
            "For bronchitis the miners' rates show considerable excess in every area, this being far greater in south-west Wales where it was more than 400 per million than elsewhere.",
            "In northern areas the excess ranged from 119 to 145, and in the midland areas from 49 to 111.",
            "This regional contrast in the bronchitis occu- pational hazard is connected with the frequency of pneumoconiosis as indicated in the table.",
            "The frequency of this condition without tuberculosis in the Welsh miners was 60 times that expected from all males of England and Wales, compared with about 5 times expectation in the other mining areas.",
            "Miners' rates from respiratory tuberculosis have been divided between those with and without mention of pneumoconiosis, the proportion of the former being 94 per cent of the total in the Brecknock-Carmarthen-Pembroke area, over 60 per cent in Glamorgan and Monmouth, about 50 per cent in Cheshire-Lancashire and Stafford-Shropshire-Worcester, 26 per cent in West Riding, about 20 per cent in Durham-Northumberland, 12 per cent in Derby-Leicester-Warwick, and 3 per cent in Nottingham.",
            "Since the miners' population has been falling, some of the mortality excess amongst miners may have arisen from removal into other occupations of healthy young men.",
            "Between 1931 and 1951, for example, the number of miners in South Wales fell by 51 per cent, whilst in Durham-Northumberland and the West Riding the fall was about 25 per cent, and in Nottingham about 20 per cent.",
            "The figures in Table III suggest that the occupational hazard from phthisis is slight in the Midlands and North East, but is considerable in South Wales and the West Riding.",
            "SUMMARY",
            "Death rates from cancer of the stomach and from respiratory diseases amongst coal miners at the working ages in 1949-53, derived from the Registrar General's data have been compared in 9 mining areas with rates amongst non-miners living in the same counties and distributed in the same way by ages and urbanization of place of residence.",
            "The comparison indicates an occupational hazard for stomach cancer which is greatest in South Wales, least in the Midlands, and intermediate in Northern England.",

            "However, these results could be due to an effect of illness or anxiety on diet and/or metabolism, and in both studies urinary nitrogen excretion was lower in cases than in controls, suggesting that the cases had a relatively low intake of protein and perhaps a low food intake at the time they were studied.",
            "The current analysis of the Life Span Study showed, as in the previous analysis of Goodman et al (1997), that breast cancer risk was associated with the well established risk factors, including age, age at menarche, age at menopause, parity and age at first birth, and body mass index.",
            "The only statistically significant associations of breast cancer risk with dietary factors were a decrease in risk with increasing consumption of dried fish and an increase in risk with high consumption of pickled vegetables; these associations were not prior hypotheses and, because of the large number of comparisons made, they may be due to chance.",
            "The absence of significant associations of breast cancer risk with the other foods and drinks examined is compatible with the results of other epidemiological studies of nutrition and breast cancer (Hunter and Willett, 1996).",
            "This cohort is unusual in that many women were exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation, and this is strongly related to breast cancer risk, as documented in previous studies in this cohort (e.g. Tokunaga et al, 1994).",
            "In contrast to previous reports on breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study we did not observe a higher risk for women who were very young at the time of the bombing.",
            "This is because the highest risk associated with exposure to radiation in previous reports was among women who were under age 20 at the time of the bombing and diagnosed before age 35; all these cases were diagnosed before 1979 (Tokunaga et al, 1994), and few of them contribute to the current analysis.",
            "In this investigation, radiation exposure was only of interest as a potential confounder or effect modifier of any association of soya consumption with breast cancer risk.",
            "All the analyses of dietary factors and cancer risk were adjusted for radiation exposure; furthermore, the results were similar in the subgroup of women exposed to very little radiation.",
            "The clear associations of breast cancer risk with established hormonally mediated risk factors suggest that radiation does not mask hormonally mediated effects, and both Land et al (1994aLand et al ( , 1994b) ) and Goodman et al (1997) concluded that reproductive factors affect the risk for breast cancer in this cohort irrespective of the exposure to radiation.",
            "We therefore think that it is unlikely that the absence of an association between soya consumption and breast cancer risk is due to the substantial role of radiation as a cause of breast cancer in this cohort.",
            "Another unusual characteristic of this cohort is the strong relationship of breast cancer risk with calendar period.",
            "The increase in breast cancer rates between the early 1970s and the early 1990s has been described before both in data from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki cancer registries (Goodman et al, 1994) and in Japan as a whole (Watanabe, 1993;Nagata et al, 1997b).",

            "Nagata et al (1997b) estimated that under 40% of the increase between 1959-1960 and 1983-1987 could be accounted for by changes in age at menarche, age at first birth, parity and age at menopause, suggesting that other powerful risk factors must exist.",

            "Results",
            "Here we report the fabrication and doping of carbon nanotube cables (we have chosen to use the terminology \u201ccable\u201d rather than fiber, as the main application pursued here is electrical transport), with resistivity one order of magnitude closer to the resistivity of Cu than the predecessors.",
            "We believe that the superior conductivity is achieved by a synergistic effect of the unique structure of the CNTs, the rational design of processing and doping.",
            "Figure 1 (a) shows the nanotubes aligned in one direction, (see Methods and Supplementary Video S6 for processing information).",
            "Supplementary Figure S2 shows the nanotube bundles interconnected and formed into a continuous network (Macroscopically the continuous network has an open-ended cylindrical shape, which we call nanotube \u201cstocking\u201d).",
            "The small bundles and the nanotubes by themselves are several microns long.",
            "After the nanotubes were fabricated into the cable as shown in supplementary Fig.",
            "S2, the natural alignment of the nanotube \u201cstocking\u201d was retained which turns out to be beneficial for the conductivity of the cable.",
            "The nanotubes we have used here (Inset of Fig. 1b) are double-walled (DWNT); the diameters are in the range of 2\u20133\u2005nm and uniform (Fig. 1b).",
            "To improve the conductivity of the raw DWNT cable, the nanotubes were doped with iodine.",
            "The raw DWNT cables were placed in the iodine vapor at 200\u00b0C for 12 hrs.",
            "Figure 1 (c) shows that the surface morphology of the iodine doped cable are similar to the raw cable.",
            "By SEM, we could not observe changes in diameter or any other morphology changes as a result of the iodine doping.",
            "Supplementary Figure S3 shows high contrast dark spots distributed over the surface of DWNTs, which could correspond to iodine clusters and atoms.",
            "The GIF elemental mappings for carbon and iodine as shown in Fig. 1 (d) and Fig. 1 (e) indicate that the location of carbon and iodine overlap, suggesting that iodine is uniformly present within the cable.",
            "Figure 1 (f) is a schematic for the proposed model, where the iodine atoms are homogeneously adsorbed on the surface of DWNTs.",
            "The molecular simulation shows that iodine atoms are less likely to penetrate into the inter-layer spacing or inside of the tubes, especially when they are well capped.",
            "For the DWNT bundles, the iodine atoms can penetrate into interstitial spaces between tubes and form an intercalated structure.",
            "To reveal the bonding of iodine atoms with the DWNTs we observed their x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS).",
            "The doped cable without any further treatment has an iodine atomic percentage of 3.3%.",
            "After washing and sonicating in ethanol, the iodine concentration drops to 2.1%.",
            "In an independent experiment, the doped cable was heated in vacuum (150\u00b0C for 72hrs),which brought the iodine level to 2.3% (Fig. 2 (a)).",
            "These experiments show that the physically bonded iodine can be removed and the iodine remained on the surface of the DWNTs has a relatively strong chemical bonding.",
            "In comparison to the carbon XPS spectra before and after the doping (inset of Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 2(b), respectively), we can see the peak appearing at 285.2\u2005eV after the doping, which corresponds to the energy of the C\u2013I bonds.",
            "The peaks at 284.5\u2005eV and 288.7\u2005eV are assigned to C\u2013C and C\u2013O bonds, respectively.",

            "The size effect could be due to the fact that defects such as voids are invariably introduced into the larger cables during the fabrication process.",
            "The lowest resistivity found for the raw cables is \u223c5*10\u22127\u2005\u2126.m.",

            "The chemically bonded iodine as acceptors form (I3)\u2212 and (I5)\u2212 polyiodide chains in the intercalated sites, while mobile holes are created in the DWNTs.",
            "Due to the increasing density of mobile holes, the electrical conductivity of the cables was improved by the iodine doping.",
            "X-ray diffraction spectra (Supplementary Fig. S4) shows that the (002) peak at 2\u03b8\u223c10.86\u00b0 corresponding to the inter-layer spacing between the outer and inner wall of the DWNTs shifts to the higher angle after the iodine doping.",
            "The shift is due to the suppression of the inter-layer spacing from 3.76\u2005\u00c5 to 3.63\u2005\u00c5.",
            "The X-ray spectra could be a direct indication of charge transfer and covalent bond formation.",
            "The lowest resistivity observed in our cables corresponds to \u223c1.5*10\u22127\u2005\u2126.m for the doped cables.",
            "Although the raw DWNT cables are not as conductive as metals, their specific conductivity (conductivity/weight) value is very high as the density of the nanotube cable is much lower than the density of metals.",
            "The raw DWNT cables have an average density of 0.28\u2005g/cm3 and the iodine doped cables have an average density of 0.33\u2005g/cm3.",
            "In terms of specific conductivity, the raw and doped cables are comparable with metals.",
            "For the iodine doped cables, the highest specific conductivity of 1.96*104\u2005S.m2/kg was observed, which is higher than that of Al and Cu, but slightly lower than that of sodium, which has the highest specific conductivity of among metals of 2.16*104\u2005S.m2/kg.",
            "A comparison in specific conductivity among raw, doped DWNT cables and a variety of metals is shown in Fig. 3 (b).",
            "Copper is the most commonly used raw material for conducting wires.",
            "In this study, we compared the relative resistance (the ratio of the measured resistance, RT to the resistance at 300\u2005K, R300 K) of our cables with that of copper in the temperature range from 200\u2005K to 400\u2005K (normal operating temperature range for conducting wires).",
            "As shown in Fig. 3 (c), the reduced resistance versus temperature curves for copper and the DWNT cables are both linear from 200\u2005K to 400\u2005K.",
            "For the iodine doped cable, the resistance at 200\u2005K to 400\u2005K varies by \u22129% and 9% with respect to the resistance at 300\u2005K.",
            "By contrast, the corresponding variations in copper are \u221243% and 43%.",
            "We also studied the stability of the electrical properties for the iodine doped cables.",
            "At room temperature, the doped cables kept the resistance value at a constant level for the whole testing period of a minimum seven days.",
            "Figure 3 (d) shows the resistance as a function of temperature measured on two of the doped cables.",
            "In the first experiment, a 10.2\u2005\u03bcm cable was continuously cooled down from room temperature to 20\u2005K, heated up to 420\u2005K, and cooled down to 20\u2005K again.",
            "The heating/cooling rate was 1 K/min.",
            "The resistance versus temperature plot shows no hysteresis.",
            "This indicates that the iodine doping is stable upon the thermal cycling in this time scale.",
            "Current carrying capacity is a property which measures the maximum current that can be passed through the unit cross sectional area of a conducting medium before it fails.",
            "An individual MWNT has extremely high current carrying capacity of 109\u20131010\u2005A/cm2.",
            "This compares with nanoscale copper having a capacity of 106\u2005A/cm2.",
            "However, the current carrying capacity for the macroscopic nanotube cables as reported in literature is much lower than that for individual single-walled nanotubes, 105\u2005A/cm2.",
            "That finding is consistent with our results based on seven raw and seven iodine doped DWNT cables, which have current carrying capacities ranging from 104 to 105\u2005A/cm2.",
            "Although the macroscopic cables do not have the extremely high current carrying capacity of individual nanotubes, they still have a sufficiently high capacity to be capable of loading utilities even for small diameter cables.",
            "From W. H. Preece's formula, we calculated the current carrying capacity of the copper wires in open air to be104 to 105\u2005A/cm2",
            "(The copper wires of diameter varying from 5\u2005\u03bcm to 100\u2005\u03bcm).",
            "DWNT cables' current carrying capacity is competitive to that of copper wires.",
            "The nanotube cables also have the ability to be joined and assembled into larger structures.",
            "For example, two parallel DWNT cables were twisted and braided into one as shown in Fig. 4 (a).",
            "Before twisting, the two cables had resistances of 24\u2005\u2126 and 20\u2005\u2126 individually.",
            "Theoretically, the twisted thick cable from these two cables in a parallel configuration should have a resistance of 10.9\u2005\u2126 (Rtheoretical  =  24 \u2126 *20 \u2126/ (24 \u2126 +20 \u2126).",
            "From the measurement, we found that the assembled thick cable has a resistance of 10.5\u2005\u2126.",
            "This difference might be due to fact that the twisting renders better packing of the nanotubes in the cables and hence decreases the electrical resistivity of the individual cables themselves.",
            "This is a good indication suggesting that larger cable/wire structures of any arbitrary sizes can be built from the individual cables without sacrificing their electrical properties.",
            "Two individual cables (cable 1, diameter  =  13\u2005\u03bcm; cable 2, diameter  =  11.5\u2005\u03bcm) were also serially connected by a tie as shown in Fig. 4 (e).",
            "The two cables were knotted by a micromanipulator.",
            "Traditional weaving techniques used in the textile industry should also be applicable for making such connections between cables.",
            "The resistivity of cable 1 and 2 individually are 9.6*10\u22127\u2005\u2126.m and 9.35*10\u22127\u2005\u2126.m, respectively.",
            "Based on the resistivity, diameter and length of each cable (length is for the segment between the tie and its adjacent electrode), we can calculate the resistance of cable 1 and 2 as 15.33\u2005\u2126 and 16.34\u2005\u2126.",
            "The assembled structure of cable 1, cable 2 and the tie has a resistance of 31.9\u2005\u2126.",
            "The resistance from the tie would then be \u223c0.23\u2005\u2126 suggesting that no significant resistance is introduced by the knot and indeed several short cables could be easily assembled to longer ones.",
            "The cable as the conducting wire is demonstrated in a circuit as shown in Fig. 4 (b) and (d).",
            "A household bulb (9 watts, 0.15A, 120V) was connected with the public power supply through the twisted wire.",
            "The light bulb was powered up.",
            "The circuit was turned on for 3 days.",
            "The nanotube cable functioned well for the whole testing period.",
            "In the circuit, the cable replaced a section of copper wire as shown in Fig. 4 (c).",
            "Here the nanotube cable is much smaller in diameter than copper wires.",
            "It is also found that the cables are mechanically quite robust.",
            "The average ultimate tensile strengths for the undoped and doped cables are 320\u2005MPa and 640\u2005MPa, respectively, comparable to metals.",
            "Supplementary Figure S5 shows the stress-strain curves for the two samples; after doping, the cable's strength increased but the strain to failure became smaller.",
            "Discussion",
            "In summary, we have made double-walled carbon nanotube cables that outperform Cu and Al in specific electrical conductivity.",
            "Iodine doping effectively increases the conductivity of the cables, as well as their tensile strength.",
            "Using cables as the building blocks and employing different assembly methods, larger and longer wires and cables can be created and we have used this approach to demonstrate a nanotube wire circuit to power a household light bulb.",
            "These lightweight nanotube cables could be serious contenders for replacing metal wires in electrical transmission as they would have intrinsic advantages to metals such as high temperature stability and chemical resistance.",
            "Methods",

            "This finding has implications for the use of both agents in combination in the treatment of psoriasis.",
            "It is estimated that 2-3% of people in Britain suffer from psoriasis.",
            "Many of the remedies for this chronic skin condition have demonstrable genotoxic effects in experimental animals and in in vitro assays (Bridges et al., 1981).",
            "The evidence for carcinogenicity in humans of individual therapies remains, at best, equivocal (Pittelkow et al., 1981;  Wolff, 1990), although excesses of skin cancer have been observed with combination therapies, for example UV light and coal tar (Stern et al., 1980).",
            "Coal tar is rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, many of which are potent skin carcinogens and tumour initiators.",
            "Evidence of DNA damage, in the form of aromatic adducts, has been detected in both mouse and human skin, and also in mouse internal organs, following topical application of coal tar (Schoket et al., 1988(Schoket et al., , 1990)).",
            "Dithranol (anthralin), while not carcinogenic in itself, has been shown to act as a promoter of the growth of tumours initiated by other agents (Bock & Burns, 1963; Viluksela et al., 1986).",
            "Therefore, the possibility exists that patients previously treated with coal tar and subsequently using dithranol are being subjected to a two-stage carcinogenicity protocol akin to the classic mouse skin model (Berenblum, 1982).",
            "Materials and methods",
            "In order to determine the potential of treatment with coal tar ointment followed by dithranol to be tumorigenic, the fol- lowing study was performed.",
            "Female CD-1 mice, aged 7-8 weeks, were treated topically five times weekly (Monday to Friday, inclusive) with 1.5% coal tar ointment (Lorinden) ('initiator', 50 mg per treatment) for 2 weeks, and then with 0.1 % dithranol cream ('promoter', 50 mg per treatment) three times weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for 40 weeks, beginning I week after finishing coal tar treatment.",
            "A positive control group was initiated with a single treatment of 50 yg of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) (an initiating, but not com- pletely carcinogenic, dose; Berenblum, 1982) and then pro- moted with dithranol.",

            "These, together with organs having an abnormal appearance, were placed in 10% (v/v) buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned, stained with haemotoxylin and eosin and examined microscopically.",
            "In addition, groups of four mice were treated with coal tar for 2 weeks or benzo[a]pyrene (single dose) as described above, or untreated, and were killed 9 days after treatment with BP and 12 days after the final application of coal tar.",
            "Another group was given three doses of dithranol (on alter- nate days, as described above) and killed 3 days after the final dose.",
            "DNA was isolated from the treated areas of epidermis, hydrolysed enzymically to nucleoside 3'-mono- phosphates and then 32P-post-labelled by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [7_-32P]ATP as previously described (Phillips et al., 1986; Schoket et al., 1988).",
            "The DNA digests were then subjected to multidirectional thin-layer chromato- graphy (TLC) on polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose and the presence of DNA adducts was detected by autoradiography (Phillips et al., 1986).",
            "Survival plots of time to tumour were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method (Kaplan & Meier, 1958).",

            "Results and discussion",
            "The chromatograms obtained when digests of DNA from mouse skin that had been treated with coal tar or BP confirmed the DNA-binding activity of these agents.",
            "In the case of BP, a single major adduct spot and a number of very minor ones were detected (Figure lb).",
            "With DNA from coal tar-treated mice, a series of adduct spots in a diagonal band was observed (Figure la), indicative of DNA binding by a number of different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and similar to adduct patterns induced by similar complex mix- tures (Schoket et al., 1988, 1990).",
            "No adduct spots were detected in mice that were not treated with an initiator (Figure lc).",
            "The chromatograms of DNA from mice treated with dithranol were identical to those of DNA from un- treated mice, confirming that dithranol does not form DNA adducts in vivo (data not shown).",
            "We have previously reported the absence of DNA adduct formation by dithranol in human skin treated in organ culture (Schoket et al.,  1990).",

            "In comparison, 50% of the surviving mice initiated with benzo[a]pyrene, a potent skin carcinogen, and promoted with dithranol developed papil- lomas (1-20 mm); seven mice had more than one tumour.",
            "Five mice that received dithranol only also had enlarged lymph nodes, while this condition was not observed in any of the mice treated with coal tar only or with benzo[a]pyrene followed by dithranol.",
            "The papillomas were exophytic with an irregular thickened epidermis, often covered by a thick layer of hyperkeratosis.",
            "The dermis was infiltrated with chronic inflammatory cells.",
            "In the enlarged lymph nodes, the normal follicular architecture was present, but there was a considerable reactive hyperplasia.",
            "In some instances, a moderate to severe sinus histiocytosis was also observed.",
            "In one animal treated with dithranol only, the normal architec- ture was effaced and replaced with a lymphatic lymphoma.",
            "Previous studies have reported the carcinogenicity of longterm application of coal tar to mouse skin (IARC, 1985), but the effect of short-term treatment followed by dithranol has not been previously investigated.",
            "The results of the present pilot study indicate that sequential treatment of mice with modest therapeutic doses of pharmaceutical formulations containing coal tar and dithranol is tumorigenic, while neither agent alone induced tumours at these doses.",
            "This requires further investigation, but suggests that caution should be exercised when prescribing dithranol therapy to psoriasis patients who have been treated with coal tar in the past, as the tumorigenic risk may be magnified by such prior exposure.",

            "It has been demonstrated that NNK induces DNA damage, including single-strand DNA breaks, alkylphosphotriester formation (8), DNA adduct formation, increased oxidative stress (9), as well as induction of p53 and Ras mutations (6, 8).",

            "However, k-Ras mutations are absent in small cell lung cancer (SCLC; Ref. 12).",

            "Bcl2 and c-Myc are two major oncogenic proteins that can functionally cooperate in cell proliferation, transformation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (17).",
            "To avoid c-Myc-induced cell death and ensure continuous cell proliferation, Bcl2 functions as one of the most potent Myc-cooperating oncoproteins (13, 18), which is a global inhibitor of apoptosis, likely through multiple mechanisms (14, 19).",
            "Bcl2 can specifically abrogate c-Myc-induced apoptosis without affecting the c-Myc mitogenic function (18).",

            "Recent reports indicate that NNK is not only an important etiological factor in lung tumor development but also potently stimulates proliferation of SCLC cells (4, 32).",
            "Because Bcl2 and c-Myc are two major oncoproteins that cooperatively regulate cell survival and proliferation (17-18), NNK may functionally target these two oncoproteins to promote proliferation of lung cancer cells.",
            "To inhibit apoptotic potential and ensure the oncogenic and proliferative functions of c-Myc, cooperation with a survival gene like Bcl2 is required (17).",
            "Our results indicate that NNK can induce phosphorylation of both Bcl2 and c-Myc in association with increased proliferation of human SCLC cells (Fig. 1).",
            "This suggests that NNK may facilitate a functional cooperation between Bcl2 and c-Myc in a mechanism involving phosphorylation of both regulators.",
            "Deregulation of c-Myc occurs in a broad range of human tumors, including lung cancer (21).",
            "c-Myc not only promotes G1 to S cell cycle progression in a mechanism involving activation of cyclin-E/CDK2 (53, 54) but also sensitizes cells to apoptosis (13, 18).",
            "To test whether the cooperation between Bcl2 and c-Myc is required for NNK-induced lung cancer cell proliferation, expression of c-Myc is specifically depleted by RNA interference.",
            "This maneuver significantly reduces NNK-stimulated proliferation of H69 cells (Fig. 2), indicating that c-Myc may be required for NNK-induced proliferation of lung cancer cells.",
            "Growth factor (i.e. interleukin-3)-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 in the flexible loop domain has been reported to enhance the survival function of Bcl2 (19, 23).",
            "NNK not only induces Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 to positively regulate cell survival but also simultaneously stimulates c-Myc phosphorylation at Thr58 and Ser62 to enhance the multiple functions of c-Myc including proliferation and apoptotic potential (Figs. 1 and 3; Refs. 14 and 55).",
            "Because Bcl2 is known to block c-Myc-mediated apoptosis in a cooperative mechanism (13, 18), NNK-induced phosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70 may specifically inhibit c-Myc-induced apoptosis to ensure the proliferative function of c-Myc.",
            "To test whether NNK-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 enhances the antiapoptotic function of Bcl2, H82 cells expressing WT, S70A, or S70E were treated with cisplatin.",
            "NNK was found to significantly prolong survival of cells expressing WT but not S70A Bcl2 following treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin (Fig. 3).",
            "This reveals that phosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70 is required for NNK-induced survival.",
            "Thus, Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 may cooperatively inhibit the apoptotic effect of c-Myc to promote the oncogenic and proliferative functions of c-Myc.",

            "Cellular membrane depolarization resulting from the binding of NNK to the \u03b17 nAChR causes the opening of voltage-gated ion channels, resulting in the influx of Ca2+ and activation of PKC that can trigger the Raf/MEK/ERKs protein kinase cascade (7, 32).",
            "Our results indicate that NNK potently activates PKC\u03b1 and ERK1/2, the physiological kinases for both Bcl2 and c-Myc, but has no effect on either p38 or JNK1 activity (Fig. 5).",
            "The potent PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, and the MEK specific inhibitor, PD98059, not only inhibit NNK-induced phosphorylation of both Bcl2 and c-Myc but also reduce NNK-induced cell proliferation in a dose-response manner (Fig. 6).",
            "These data suggest that NNK-induced Bcl2 and c-Myc phosphorylation occurs as the result of a signal transduction pathway involving the activation of PKC and/or the ERK1/2 kinases.",
            "Because inhibition of Bcl2 and c-Myc phosphorylation correlates with decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 6), this supports a functionally inextricable relationship between Bcl2/c-Myc phosphorylation and cell proliferation.",
            "Therefore, we propose that NNK-induced phosphorylation of both Bcl2 and c-Myc may facilitate the ability of Bcl2 to cooperate with c-Myc and enhance cell proliferation.",
            "This could also explain the role of NNK in tumorigenesis and tumor development, at least in those tumors expressing both Bcl2 and c-Myc.",
            "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are cationic channels whose opening is controlled by acetylcholine and nicotinic receptor agonists.",

            "The \u03b17 nAChR is expressed in normal human small airway epithelial cells and SCLC cells (7, 32).",
            "NNK binds to and activates \u03b17 nAChR, which results in the influx of Ca2+ and triggers a PKC/RAF/MEK/ERK protein kinase cascade (7).",
            "The \u03b17 nAChR-specific inhibitor \u03b1-BTX potently blocks NNK-induced activation of ERK1/2 as well as phosphorylation of Bcl2 and c-Myc in association with decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 7).",
            "Thus, NNK-induced cell proliferation may occur through activation of the \u03b17 nAChR signal transduction pathway involving \u03b17 nAChR/PKC/ERK/Bcl2/c-Myc in SCLC cells.",
            "These findings suggest that \u03b1-BTX may abolish Bcl2/c-Myc cooperation in a mechanism involving inhibition of their phosphorylation that dampens NNK-induced cell proliferation.",
            "Therefore, \u03b1-BTX may have potential clinical relevance in strategies designed to restrain cell proliferation through this novel mechanism in patients with lung cancer.",
            "Previous reports indicate that Bcl2 can specifically block the apoptotic function of c-Myc while leaving its proliferative activity unaffected (18).",
            "Bcl2 suppression of c-Myc-induced apoptosis exposes multiple oncogenic properties of c-Myc and triggers carcinogenic progression (17, 55, 57).",
            "However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which Bcl2 may functionally synergize with c-Myc remains unclear.",
            "Our data reveal that Bcl2 and c-Myc co-localize in mitochondria as well as the nucleus and NNK potently enhances a direct interaction between Bcl2 and c-Myc in human SCLC cells (Figs. 8 and 9).",
            "This may uncover a novel mechanism by which NNK promotes a functional cooperation between these two oncoproteins in both the mitochondria and nucleus when they are both expressed.",
            "Because the phosphomimetic S70E mutant Bcl2 more efficiently associates with c-Myc than WT Bcl2, whereas the nonphosphorylatable S70A Bcl2 demonstrates little if any binding to c-Myc (Fig. 9), this indicates that Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 is necessary for maximal association between Bcl2 and c-Myc.",
            "Importantly, the phosphomimetic S70E mutant Bcl2 directly binds to c-Myc in nucleus and on mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 10A\n).",
            "This association significantly enhances the half-life of the c-Myc protein (Fig. 11), which may enhance the accumulation of c-Myc activity during the initial stage of cell proliferation.",
            "Because Bcl2 is an outer mitochondrial membrane-integral protein (49-50), its N terminus may be localized to the cytoplasmic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and its C terminus, bearing a hydrophobic region (49), may be inserted in the outer mitochondrial membrane.",
            "Our findings indicate that both Bcl2 and c-Myc could be removed from the outer mitochondrial membrane after treatment with proteinase K (Fig. 10B\n), suggesting that Bcl2 may function as a mitochondrial \u201creceptor\u201d associating with c-Myc through its N terminus on the surface of the outer mitochondrial membrane.",
            "Recent studies have suggested that the MBII domain (amino acids 106-143) of c-Myc is required for its apoptotic and cell cycle progression functions (35).",
            "It is possible that Bcl2 may associate with c-Myc at MBII domain to specifically abolish the apoptotic potential of c-Myc.",
            "However, further studies will be required to test this hypothesis.",
            "In summary, results reported here have identified a novel NNK-induced proliferation signal transduction pathway that depends on Bcl2 and c-Myc phosphorylation in SCLC cells (Fig. 12\n).",
            "Thus, in addition to DNA damage and p53 or Ras gene mutation, NNK also apparently induces the activation of PKC/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 protein kinase cascade through the upstream \u03b17 nAChR, which triggers phosphorylation of Bcl2 and c-Myc. NNK-induced phosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70 facilitates a cooperative interaction between Bcl2 and c-Myc that stabilizes c-Myc protein to enhance the multiple functions of c-Myc leading to the promotion of lung cancer development.",

            "The chemicals that yielded treatmentrelated ovarian lesions were 1,3-butadiene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, vinylcyclohexene deipoxide, nitrofuran- toin, nitrofurazone, benzene, A-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, and tricresylphosphate.",
            "Typical nonneoplastic ovarian changes included hypoplasia, atrophy, follicular necrosis, and tubular hyperplasia.",

            "Consequently, reproductive perturbations can re- sult from functional and/or morphologic compromise of any part of this system.",
            "The frequency of treatment- related ovarian lesions in general toxicity testing appears to be low.",
            "Thus, characterization and understand- ing of ovarian lesions when they do occur pose difficul- ties because of the lack of substantial knowledge about the ovary as a target tissue for toxicity.",
            "Even in rodent reproductive toxicity studies, significant ovarian pa- thology is usually not found.",
            "This is largely a conse- quence of the greater emphasis given to functional per- turbations in reproductive performance in these studies.",
            "Specific ovarian lesions such as oocyte necrosis and premature atresia have been produced by exposure to ionizing radiation (4) or to chemicals such as some polycycic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkyl halides, and ni- trosamines (4-6).",

            "In a review of 270 reports re- lating to clinical manifestations of female reproductive toxicity (8), approximately 45% of the reports deal with toxicity to the embryo, fetus, or placenta.",
            "Another 40% discuss perturbations of the integrated functioning of the HPOU axis.",
            "Ovarian toxicity per se represents a small proportion of the alterations, and these usually involve hormonal dysfunctions.",
            "An expanded discussion of the association between ovarian toxicity and occupational exposure to chemicals is contained in a recent review (3).",
            "Similarly, specific functional or morphologic effects on the ovary represent a small proportion of untoward effects of chemicals on the rodent reproductive system as judged by the low frequency of occur- rence of ovarian lesions in standard toxicity studies such as those conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) or in noninvasive reproductive toxicity studies (9).",

            "Indirect- acting toxins exert their toxicity either by being met- abolically activated to active toxins (e.g., cyclophosphamide, dibromochloropropane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) or by induction or inhibition of repro- ductively important enzyme systems.",
            "Since the ovary contains microsomal monooxygenases, epoxide hy- drases, and transferases (5,12), the ovary may meta- bolically activate chemicals with consequent production of ovarian lesions.",

            "Based upon epidemiological studies in nulliparous women, it appears that endogenous hormones are as- sociated with the induction or growth of ovarian tumors (13)(14)(15).",
            "Further, it has been postulated that gonadal failure may be a common perturbation for both infer- tility and ovarian neoplasia (16).",
            "Based upon the known presence of specific hormone receptors in ovarian tissue, it is reasonable to anticipate that endogenous hormones (e.g., gonadotropins, estrogens, progesterones, androgens, corticosteroids) would influence the clinical be- havior of benign and malignant ovarian neoplasms in humans and animals.",
            "From results of experimental studies, a sequence of events has been postulated relative to the development of granulosa cell tumors and tubular adenomas in ro- dents (17-21).",
            "These investigators hypothesize that de- generation of follicular granulosa cells subsequent to oocyte destruction stimulates a compensatory increase in pituitary gonadotropins which, in turn, stimulates cell proliferation and eventual development of neoplasia.",
            "While such a mechanism may be associated with development of ovarian neoplasia in mature rodents, ovarian tumors in pubertal rodents can develop in the presence of a normal population of growing oocytes and follicles (22).",
            "A similar mechanism associated with in- terruption of the normal hormonal feedback system be- tween ovary and hypothalamus/pituitary is seen in ex- periments where normal ovarian tissue is grafted to the spleen of ovariectomized rodents (23).",
            "Since venous drainage from the spleen passes through the liver, hor- mones produced by the grafted ovary are metabolized, and thus, the feedback necessary to prevent release of pituitary gonadotropins is interrupted.",
            "The result is continued production of pituitary gonadotropin, which stimulates celi proliferation in the grafted ovary and leads to development of granulosa cell tumors.",
            "Hormonally mediated induction of ovarian tumors in rodents has also been demonstrated following neonatal thymectomy (24), as well as following parabiosis with a castrate, transplantation of a gonadotropic pituitary tu- mor, or chronic exposure to hormones (23).",

            "In addition to causing ovarian tumors, 1,3-butadiene caused heman- giosarcomas of the heart, malignant lymphomas, lung tumors, and forestomach tumors in male and female mice and mammary gland tumors and liver tumors in female mice (25).",
            "Ovarian lesions in mice exposed to 1,3-butadiene for up to 60 weeks included loss of follicles, tubular hyperplasia, and several different tumor types (Tables 1 and2).",

            "Vinylcyclohexene di- epoxide has been tested by gavage and dermal exposure routes for 90 days in rats and mice and is currently being tested in a 2-year dermal study in rats and mice.",
            "While treatment-related ovarian lesions were not ob- served in either 90-day rat study, treatment-induced ovarian atrophy was found in the 90-day mouse dermal study (Table 5).",

            "No ovarian lesions were found in rats at the interim sacrifice.",
            "While final conclusions regarding ovarian carcinogenicity must await completion of the 2-year study, based upon 65week data, it is probable that vinylcyclohexene diepox- ide will be considered an ovarian carcinogen in B6C3F1 mice.",

            "Nitrofurazone is a topical antibiotic dressing.",
            "The ovarian responses in the carcinogenicity studies of these two compounds is important because of the widespread use of these chem- icals and also because the studies represent examples of carcinogenicity test results wherein the neoplastic effect is primarily restricted to the ovary.",
            "Although the results of toxicity and carcinogenicity testing should be regarded as preliminary until all aspects of the studies are peer reviewed, it is apparent at this time that the ovary was a primary target tissue for both chemicals.",

            "Nitrofurantoin was administered by dosed feed to rats and mice.",
            "In the 90-day toxicity study, necrosis of ovarian follicular epithelial cells was documented in both rats and mice and was the principal pathologic finding in the 90-day studies.",
            "Results (not peer reviewed) from the 2-year carcinogenicity studies indicate no treat- ment-associated lesions in the ovaries of rats.",
            "However, ovarian atrophy, tubular hyperplasia, and neoplasia were observed in treated mice (Table 6).",
            "In addition, adrenal hyperplasia and hepatic neoplasia were seen in treated female mice.",
            "Nitrofurazone",
            "In the 90-day nitrofurazone dosed feed toxicity study, there was pallor and vacuolization of the ovarian inter- stitial cells in rats, but no ovarian changes were asso- ciated with treatment in mice.",

            "The diagnoses and fre- quencies of the ovarian tumors in mice are detailed in Table 9.",
            "It should be noted that benzene was considered carcinogenic in both rats and mice, producing a wide spectrum of epithelial tumors in several tissues (28).",

            "Two-year studies in both species are planned.",
            "While treatment-associated uterine hypoplasia was documented in both rats and mice, ovarian changes were seen only in rats at the end of the 90-day study.",
            "The principal pathologic effect in the rat ovaries was hy- poplasia characterized by a decrease in the size and number of maturing ovarian follicles.",
            "Diagnostic no- menclature for the observed ovarian changes in rats is problematic in that it is not possible to reliably distin- guish between hypoplasia and atrophy by examination of tissues only at the conclusion of a 90-day study.",
            "Atro- phy implies that the organ was fully formed and then lost some of its mature structure.",
            "Hypoplasia implies that the ovary is being well formed but is smaller than normal (a form of ovarian dysgenesis).",

            "Tricresylphosphate",
            "Tricresylphosphate has been tested for 90 days by gavage as well as dosed feed administration in both rats and mice.",
            "While results have not been peer reviewed and, thus, should be regarded as preliminary, there was a treatment-associated hypertrophy and cytoplasmic vacuolization of interstitial cells in the ovaries of both species.",
            "In addition, cytologic alterations were noted in the adrenals of treated female rats and mice.",
            "Tricre- sylphosphate will ultimately be tested for carcinogenicity in 2-year studies.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Based upon review of the completed and uncompleted toxicity and carcinogenicity studies for the eight chem- icals described, some general conclusions and consid- erations regarding pathologic evaluation of ovarian tissues seem justified.",
            "First, the occurrence of treatmentassociated ovarian lesions in 90-day and 2-year rodent studies is not common.",
            "To date, more than 300 chemicals have been tested in 90-day and/or 2-year carcinogenicity studies.",
            "Significant treatment-related ovarian effects were found in only eight of these studies.",
            "This probably represents an underestimate of the true incidence of treatment-associated ovarian pathologic changes, since in past years, 90-day studies were used primarily to set doses for 2-year studies rather than to define subtle toxicity.",
            "Consequently, in the absence of grossly visible changes, one would not expect ovarian tissues to have been examined as critically in the past as is currently done.",
            "Despite the possibility that there may be more than eight studies in which ovarian lesions were induced by treatment, it is still reasonable to conclude that the frequency of ovarian target tissue toxicity is not high in conventional rodent toxicity and carcinogenicity stud- ies.",
            "Ovarian function and dysfunction are intimately linked with the hypothalamus, the pituitary, the uterus, and other endocrine organs.",
            "Thus, the observation that treatment-associated ovarian changes were frequently associated with pathologic alterations in other tissues (e.g., adrenal, uterus) in the eight NTP chemical studies is not surprising.",
            "In fact, the low probability that ovar- ian lesions would occur in isolation should prompt the pathologist to closely examine all parts of the HPOU and endocrine systems whenever a lesion is found in one component of this system.",
            "Closer examination of these other tissues may reveal subtle but important changes not noted on the initial pathologic examination.",
            "The ovarian lesions documented in the NTP studies covered by this paper provide supportive evidence that alterations noted in ovaries of treated rodents at the conclusion of a 90-day study may herald the ultimate development of ovarian neoplasia upon continued treat- ment.",
            "A relationship between antecedent ovarian hy- poplasia, atrophy, and hyperplasia and subsequent ovarian neoplasia has been previously proposed (17)(18)(19)(20)(21).",
            "Consequently, when ovarian changes are observed in treated animals in prechronic toxicity studies, special study design considerations (e.g., adding extra females, interim sacrifices, vaginal cytology, hormone measurements) might be warranted in subsequent carcinogen- icity/chronic toxicity studies.",
            "Definitive reproductive studies would also be warranted when ovarian lesions occur in a 90-day study.",
            "Histopathologic distinction between ovarian atrophy and hypoplasia in rodents cannot be reliably made on the basis of examination of tissues only at the conclusion of a 90-day study.",
            "Atrophy implies that the organ was fully formed and then lost some of its mature structure.",
            "Hypoplasia implies that the ovary is being well formed but is smaller than normal (a form of ovarian dysge- nesis).",
            "At the end of a typical 90-day study, the rats or mice are approximately 20 weeks of age, and ovarian tissues would be expected to be fully developed and functional.",
            "The observation of atrophy or hypoplasia at this point is problematic in that the pathologist does not know if the ovary became fully developed and then underwent atrophy or if the ovary never fully developed in the first place and was thus hypoplastic.",
            "Since the distinction between atrophy and hypoplasia may be me- chanistically important, it would be appropriate either to repeat the study and to sample ovarian tissue at earlier times or to incorporate appropriate interim sacrifices early in subsequent chronic toxicity/carcinogen- icity studies.",
            "If ovarian changes are anticipated in ad- vance, it is recommended that recovery groups be incorporated into the standard toxicity study.",
            "Histopathologic evaluation of the ovary is frequently frustrated by sampling limitations.",
            "Since the ovary is small, a typical single histologic section may not contain all tissue elements.",
            "Thus, assessment of the number of follicles or corpora lutea may be compromised.",
            "If ovar- ian changes are anticipated, serial sections from both ovaries would help ensure adequate amounts of tissue for examination.",
            "By observing similar changes in both ovaries, the conclusion that the effect is systemic will be supported.",
            "Such observations, combined with careful examination of other hormonally related tissues and the use of interim sacrifices and recovery studies, should provide appropriate material for a comprehensive histopathologic assessment of ovarian toxicity.",
            "The issue of combining tumors for purposes of as- sessing carcinogenicity is controversial.",
            "If the practice of combining related tumors is followed, it may be in- appropriate to combine some ovarian tumors.",
            "The NTP- recommended nomenclature for rodent ovarian neo- plasms is based on the cell of origin of the neoplasms.",
            "Tumors arising from diverse cells of origin should not be combined for purposes of assessing carcinogenicity."

            "The elimination kinetics of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in humans is difficult to assess in observational studies, because PCB exposure is never completely abolished.",
            "In a community with high dietary PCB exposures from whale blubber, we examined two groups of children with increased body burdens from breast-feeding.",
            "Follow-up was from ages 4.5 years to 7.5 years (99 subjects) and 7 to 14 years (101 subjects).",
            "The calculations were performed by the use of structural equation models, with adjustment for body weight and dietary blubber intake as the main source of postnatal exposure.",
            "As a likely result of background exposures, apparent elimination half-lives were unexpectedly long when based on results from all cohort members.",
            "Subjects with exposures above the median and in the highest quartile showed half-lives of about 3-4 years for CB-138, and 4.5-5.5 years for CB-105 and CB-118; 6.5-7.5 years for CB-156, CB-170, and CB-187; and 7-9 years for CB-153 and CB-180.",
            "The longest half-lives correspond to elimination of the parent PCB solely with a daily fat excretion rate of 1-2 g, while shorter half-lives assume metabolic break-down.",
            "Introduction",
            "Human studies of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) often include measurement of serum PCB concentrations as dose estimates.",
            "Because the stability of individual PCB congener concentrations over time depends upon the toxicokinetic fates, including elimination half-lives, the congener concentrations present in a serum sample at the time of clinical assessment may or may not represent the causative substances and their amounts at the time of toxic impact.",
            "Elimination is thought to follow an approximate first-order process, and biological half-lives have been calculated for several congeners in laboratory animals.",
            "Food-mediated human exposures mainly involve persistent congeners, and the \u2018weathered\u2019 congener pattern differs substantially from the PCB products originally released into the environment.",
            "Thus, more highly chlorinated congeners, such as the hexachlorinated CB-153 and CB-180, are particularly prevalent congeners in food as well as in human serum.",
            "Human data on PCB half-lives are based mainly on studies of small numbers of subjects with high exposures followed over time after cessation of exposure from a poisoning incident or after occupational exposure.",
            "Reports of unusually short half-lives may reflect distribution processes, rather than elimination alone.",
            "Other studies have reported very long elimination half-lives, although assumptions may not be fulfilled that PCB exposure was negligible after cessation of a particular source, thereby disregarding continuing background exposures.",
            "The most carefully controlled study was based on only three highly-exposed subjects.",
            "PCB exposures during development are of particular concern, because accumulation of PCBs from prenatal exposure and breastfeeding can be substantial in comparison with subsequent dietary exposure levels during childhood and adolescence.",
            "Thus, a breastfed infant's daily dose on a body weight basis may be 100-fold higher than the mother's.",
            "An additional factor is that metabolic breakdown of PCBs may be less effective in infants.",
            "On the other hand, early growth will expand the lipid compartment volume, in which the PCBs are distributed, thereby leading to a decrease in serum concentrations.",
            "However, PCBs sequestered into fat tissue may be unavailable for metabolic elimination processes, thereby prolonging the elimination half-lives.",
            "For congeners not amenable to break-down, elimination primarily occurs via fecal lipid excretion.",
            "Elimination of fecal lipids may be greater in infants relative to their body weight, thus resulting in shorter half-lives of persistent lipophilic chemicals.",
            "The overall effect of these parameters on PCB half-lives in children is poorly known.",
            "In the Faroe Islands, the main route of PCB exposure is the consumption of pilot whale blubber, which forms part of traditional diets.",
            "With average PCB concentrations in human milk fat of 1-2 \u03bcg/g lipid, the daily PCB intake of a Faroese infant has been calculated at about 8 \u03bcg/kg body weight.",
            "This exposure level is orders of magnitude higher than weaned Northern European children's average daily PCB intakes below 50 ng/kg.",
            "Hence, in Faroese adolescents aged 14 years, the serum concentrations of persistent PCB congeners remains significantly associated with the duration of breastfeeding.",
            "The rate of decrease in serum concentrations after cessation of breast-feeding may therefore allow calculation of elimination half-lives during childhood.",
            "For this purpose, we have used two sets of PCB data from Faroese birth cohorts, where serum PCB concentrations were determined on two occasions.",
            "Materials and methods",
            "Study populations",
            "The first cohort of 1022 singleton births was assembled in the Faroe Islands during a 21-month period during 1986-1987.",
            "When the cohort members were about 7 and 14 years old, they were invited for a thorough health examination with voluntary venipuncture.",
            "Height and weight were recorded as part of the physical examination.",
            "At both ages, questionnaire information was obtained about the frequency of whale meat dinners and blubber consumption.",
            "At age 7 years, 917 of the children completed the examinations, but sufficient serum for PCB analysis was available only for 124 children.",
            "Seven years later, a blood sample was obtained from 795 out of 878 subjects examined.",
            "Serum PCB analysis was conducted for a total of 101 subjects (53 boys and 48 girls) examined at both occasions (Table 1).",
            "A second cohort was recruited during a 12-month period in 1994-1995 and included 182 singleton term births from consecutive births at the Faroese National Hospital.",
            "Blood samples were obtained at 4.5 years and again at 7.5 years of age from 167 and 153 children, respectively, with sufficient serum for PCB analysis from 119 and 145.",
            "A total of 99 children had serum PCB results from both occasions.",
            "In cohort 2, the child's height and weight were recorded at 3.5 years, but not a year later.",
            "The values for age 4.5 years were therefore determined by interpolation between 3.5 and 7.5 years (Table 1).",
            "Laboratory measurements",
            "After collection of the blood samples, the blood was allowed to clot for approximately 30 minutes, spun at 10,000 rpm for 30 min to separate the serum portion of the blood, and transferred to clean cryovials.",
            "The frozen samples were hand-carried to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laboratory in the United States, where they were stored at -70\u00b0C until analyzed for PCB congeners and lipid content as previously described.",
            "Samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry with isotope dilution calibration.",
            "Ions representing the most abundant clorine-35 and chlorine-37 isotope peaks were measured for each congener and their ratios were within \u00b1 20% of the theoretical ratios.",
            "Approximately 20% of the samples analyzed were quality control materials (positive or negative controls).",
            "Samples from runs in which a quality control material violated one of the Westgard multirules were repeated until a valid quality control result was obtained.",
            "Data which violated any quality control parameter (e.g., quality control material out-of-control, ion ratios outside 20% of theoretical ratio, retention times not matching with labeled standards, excessive background levels in negative control) were not reported.",
            "Relative recoveries for all congeners were between 90% and 111% and the relative standard deviations of the measurements were less than 20%.",
            "For the present study, we selected individual congeners on the basis of their detectability in the chemical analyses.",
            "For congeners 118, 138, 153, 170, 180, and 187, all subjects had concentrations of at least 0.05 \u03bcg/g lipid, thus providing assurance that analytical variability was low.",
            "Further, because of the toxicological interest in mono-ortho congeners, such as CB-118, we also included congeners 105 and 156, with the caveat that added attention to results near the detection limit would be needed.",
            "All protocols were reviewed and approved by the Faroese ethical review committee and the institutional review board at Harvard School of Public Health; the analysis of coded samples at the CDC laboratory was determined not to require additional approval for human subjects research.",
            "Data analysis",
            "The two sets of paired serum PCB concentrations are thought to follow an exponential decay model:  where",
            "Yt is the concentration at time t and \u03b5t is a normally distributed error term.",
            "In this model, the half-life is given by  An estimate of the half-life can therefore be obtained by first estimating k.",
            "For the two sets of observations, the analysis is based on the log-transformed difference in concentrations between the two examinations, which is then given by  where t1 and t2 denote the child's age at the first and second examinations, respectively.",
            "Thus, k can be estimated as the coefficient of the age increase in a simple regression model without an intercept.",
            "For each PCB congener, we developed a joint regression model that included data from both examinations.",
            "As a starting point, the regression coefficient k and the variance of the error term \u03b5t1 - \u03b5t2 were allowed to depend on the cohort.",
            "The similarity of the regression coefficient k in the two cohorts was then tested.",
            "Assuming that they were identical, a joint estimate of the half-life was obtained.",
            "Confidence limits for the half-life was calculated from the confidence limits for k using the transformation given by equation [1].",
            "These calculations were initially carried out without any cofactors.",
            "To adjust for possible confounding effects caused by age-related differences in distribution volumes, the body mass index (BMI) was taken into account by including the difference in log-transformed BMI as an additional predictor of the difference in log-transformed PCB concentrations, i.e.,",
            "In this model, -ln(0.5)/k can be interpreted as the half-life for PCB concentrations in children with a constant BMI.",
            "Alternatively, this model can be interpreted as an exponential decay model in Xt = Yt \u22c5 (BMIt)c were c is a constant independent of t.",
            "To test if BMI provided an adequate description of the changes in distribution volume, the difference in log-transformed weight was entered as an additional covariate, i.e.,",
            "If this covariate had a negligible effect, the model only including BMI as a covariate was considered adequate.",
            "Serum PCB concentrations are usually expressed in reference to the serum lipid concentration.",
            "While this tradition may be appropriate, the significance of the serum lipid concentration was tested by using the serum-lipid concentration as a covariate in calculations using the volume-based PCB concentrations.",
            "Thus, we fitted the model  where Zt1 and Zt2 are volume-based concentrations at the two time points and lipid is the serum-lipid concentration.",
            "In regard to postnatal exposures, consumption of pilot whale could be a non-negligible PCB source in the children, depending on when they started eating this traditional food item.",
            "Two different approaches were taken to allow for this problem.",
            "First we stratified the analysis to include only those children who, according to the questionnaire, had not eaten whale.",
            "Then, to avoid problems with small numbers of subjects after the exclusions, we also adjusted for whale intake using a regression approach by including as a continuous covariate the number of monthly whale dinners that the child consumed at the time of the examination",
            "In this model, -ln(0.5)/k can be interpreted as the half-life in children with no postnatal PCB intake from whale blubber.",
            "To assess the robustness of these findings, we carried out additional calculations after exclusion of subjects with an initial PCB concentration below the median, where the impact of analytical imprecision may be relatively greater, and where dietary PCB exposures between the two examinations may have played a proportionately greater role.",
            "We also repeated the calculation for subjects with a total PCB concentration in the highest quartile.",
            "Results",
            "Descriptive results for the paired serum concentrations and their ratios are shown in Table 2.",
            "The lipid-based concentrations generally decreased between the two examinations, with substantial variability between subjects and among congeners.",
            "Two sets of paired results of PCB congener concentrations are shown graphically in Figure 1.",
            "Half-lives were first calculated in structural equation models without any adjustment for covariates.",
            "However, with overall averages approaching 10 years, these results were considered unreliable and possibly affected by confounders.",
            "The BMI increased between the examinations; e.g., in Cohort 1 by 23% from age 7 to 14 years.",
            "Increases in BMI were associated with decreased serum congener concentrations; the negative association between BMI and PCB concentrations was clearer at age 14 than at age 7 years (data not shown).",
            "BMI was therefore included in the model, assuming that the BMI reflects the distribution volume (addition of body weight to the equation did not cause any changes).",
            "In addition, as previously reported, some cohort subjects had started eating whale blubber, and dietary intake during the observation period could therefore have added to their serum PCB concentrations.",
            "However, these adjustments changed the estimates only marginally (data not shown).",
            "Stratification was therefore used to rule out possible impact of background exposures that might cause an apparent increase of half-lives at lower concentration ranges.",
            "Calculations based on subjects with a total PCB concentration above the median are shown in Table 3.",
            "All elimination half-lives now averaged less than 10 years.",
            "A repeated calculation for the subjects in the highest quartile (Table 4) resulted in a further, though less certain, decrease in half-lives.",
            "Because postnatal PCB intake may be inaccurately reflected by the dietary questionnaire response, additional analyses were carried out on data only from subjects who did not eat whale blubber at all (Figure 1).",
            "This restriction did not affect the findings (data not shown).",
            "Expression of PCB concentrations in relation to the lipid concentration may have some limitations; therefore, the same calculations were repeated using the volume-based serum concentrations, while the lipid concentration was entered as a covariate.",
            "This adjustment also rendered very similar results (not shown).",
            "Stratification by sex showed no differences in half-lives between boys and girls.",
            "Overall, the half-lives for CB-138 were about 3-4 years; for CB-105 and CB-118, 4.5-5.5 years; for CB-156, CB-170, and CB-187, 6.5-7.5 years; and for CB-153 and CB-180, the half-lives were 7-9 years.",
            "Discussion",
            "The present study extends the data on temporal decay of children's serum PCB concentrations.",
            "The material is unique, because a high PCB accumulation by the time of weaning resulted from the occurrence of highly increased maternal PCB body burdens from the traditional habit of eating pilot whale blubber.",
            "As calculated by the European Food Safety Authority, daily intakes from breast-feeding may be two orders of magnitude higher than background dietary exposures.",
            "Under most circumstances, the exposure during the post-weaning period will be close to negligible.",
            "In agreement with this notion, Barr et al. found that the duration of the breast-feeding period remained a significant predictor for serum-PCB concentrations in Faroese adolescents at age 14 years, although this association was not statistically significant for some less chlorinated congeners.",
            "This study also reported that postnatal blubber intake was associated with increases of serum PCB concentrations.",
            "Accordingly, adjustment or stratification for dietary PCB exposure from traditional food was necessary in the calculation of elimination half-lives.",
            "Further, adjustment for body size as an indicator of the lipid compartment size was also included.",
            "The impact of continuous background exposures was controlled for by relying on the results obtained at higher average PCB exposures that would be less amenable to bias from comparatively low background exposures.",
            "These findings should be considered in the light of what is known about PCB elimination mechanisms.",
            "PCB excretion with lipids in the stool is thought to represent the major non-metabolic excretion route for persistent, lipophilic substances.",
            "Based on this elimination route only, and given the average fecal lipid excretion rate, a maximum half-life of 9.5 years can be calculated for adults.",
            "Assuming that proportional lipid excretions levels are similar in children, calculated half-lives substantially in excess of this level would therefore likely be biased.",
            "Half-lives of this magnitude would correspond to a fecal fat excretion of about 1-2 g/day in children.",
            "More rapid elimination may occur if metabolic conversion takes place.",
            "Phase-1 conversion by P450 enzymes may constitute the major rate-limiting step for certain PCB congeners.",
            "The present study shows that elimination half-lives in the subjects with PCB levels above the median were similar to those observed in the subjects from the highest quartile.",
            "These findings do not support a deviation from first-order kinetics, whereby increased elimination would occur at higher exposure level.",
            "The results obtained coincide with data from previously published studies of adults.",
            "Follow-up of occupational cohorts have resulted in CB-118 half-lives of 5.8 years and 9.6 years, although overestimation due to continued background exposures cannot be ruled out.",
            "Similarly, Masuda reported a half-life above 9 years for this congener in a recent follow-up study of poisoning victims, while Ryan et al. had calculated a shorter half-life of 1.2 years in highly exposed Yu-Cheng patients during the first decade after the incident.",
            "Using measured intakes in the diet as an indicator of daily exposure, and assuming steady-state conditions, the half-life for CB-118 was calculated at between 3.8 years and 6.3 years.",
            "Our calculated half-life of about 5 years concurs with this magnitude.",
            "Half-lives for PCB congeners 138, 153, and 180 were estimated to be of 3.4 years, 3.8 years, and 4.3 years in Yu-Cheng patients during the first decade after the toxic exposure.",
            "Somewhat greater values of 6-7 years for CB-138 and 12.4 years for CB-153 were based on follow-up of workers after cessation of occupational exposure.",
            "Long-term half-lives of at least 9 years for CB-138, CB-153, and CB-180 were reported by Masuda and Wolff et al..",
            "As previously indicated, these results may have been biased by continued background exposures.",
            "Our data on children suggest that CB-138 is less persistent than CB-153, which has a half-life about twice as long.",
            "Our results for CB-180 are affected by the less robust findings from Cohort 2 likely from analytic variation, but suggest that its half-life is similar to the one of CB-153.",
            "For related lipophilic substances, such as tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, young children reportedly exhibit shorter elimination half-lives than adults.",
            "An age dependency was also supported by the findings in an 11-month follow-up study of exposed children, where serum-PCB concentrations decreased by half, thus suggesting half-lives of about one year.",
            "However, the first serum sample could perhaps reflect PCB concentrations in more superficial compartments before complete redistribution within the lipid phase, and the lipid phase may have expanded due to growth during the observation period.",
            "The elimination rate may therefore have been overestimated.",
            "In the present study, the calculated half-lives of PCB congeners did not differ between the two cohorts, despite the difference in age.",
            "Also, the results obtained are in better agreement with findings from exposed adults than with the limited short-term studies in children.",
            "This finding suggests that fecal lipid excretion is of the same proportional importance in children and adolescents as in adults.",
            "Metabolic elimination of PCBs involves conversion into polar hydroxylated metabolites, which are more easily excreted in urine and feces.",
            "P450 enzymes contribute to this Phase I metabolism.",
            "For the most relevant enzyme P450 1A2, small children below about 6 months of age have a reduced activity in comparison with adults, while the activity is relatively increased during later childhood and early adolescence.",
            "A recent study from the Faroe Islands showed that, in comparison with their mothers, 7-year-old children had higher blood concentrations of OH-PCB-107, which is a metabolite formed from either PCB-105 or PCB-118; the three other main OH-PCB congeners were of comparable magnitude.",
            "This evidence would suggest that the half-life of these two congeners could be shorter in children than in adults.",
            "Although this possibility cannot be decided from the present data, both PCB-105 and PCB-118 had half-lives of 4.5-5.5 years that clearly were lower than those observed for PCB-153 and PCB-180.",
            "These data therefore point to the degree of chlorination as an important predictor of biological persistence, with a tendency of longer retention in heptachlorinated congeners (CB-170, CB-180, and CB-187) than in less chlorinated substances, especially the pentachlorinated CB-105 and CB-118.",
            "The retention of CB-138, CB-156 and CB-170 would likely be intermediate between these two groups.",
            "The latter five congeners share the property of possessing two vicinal, unsubstituted carbon atoms, thereby providing easier access for metabolizing enzymes.",
            "However, the hexachlorinated CB-153 does not share that property and also has a fairly long half-life.",
            "Thus, prediction of PCB congener persistence seems insufficient from these two aspects of chemical structure.",
            "In conclusion, the present study utilized a large data set on serum-PCB concentrations from prospective studies of Faroese birth cohorts.",
            "Highly chlorinated congeners CB-153 and CB-180 persist in the body and show an apparent half-life averaging about 7-9 years, which can be explained by elimination with fecal lipids.",
            "CB-138 (3-4 years) and CB-105 and CB-118 (about 5 years) clearly had shorter half-lives.",
            "No indication was found that half-lives in children aged 4-14 years are shorter than in adults, thus supporting the notion that fecal fat elimination may represent a fairly constant proportion in regard to body size."

            "Our understanding of the interaction between the gut microbiota and host health has recently improved dramatically.",
            "However, the effects of toxic metal exposure on the gut microbiota remain poorly characterized.",
            "As this microbiota creates a critical interface between the external environment and the host\u2019s cells, it may play an important role in host outcomes during exposure.",
            "We therefore used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing to track changes in the gut microbiota composition of rats exposed to heavy metals.",
            "Rats were exposed daily for five days to arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, nickel, or a vehicle control.",
            "Significant changes to microbiota composition were observed in response to high doses of chromium and cobalt, and significant dose-dependent changes were observed in response to arsenic, cadmium and nickel.",
            "Many of these perturbations were not uniform across metals.",
            "However, bacteria with higher numbers of iron-importing gene orthologs were overly represented after exposure to arsenic and nickel, suggesting some possibility of a shared response.",
            "These findings support the utility of the microbiota as a pre-clinical tool for identifying exposures to specific heavy metals.",
            "It is also clear that characterizing changes to the functional capabilities of microbiota is critical to understanding responses to metal exposure.",
            "Introduction",
            "The microbiota of the mammalian gut is recognized as an important factor in maintaining host health.",
            "For example, the gut microbiota is crucial for the development of the immune system and a healthy gastrointestinal tract.",
            "Disruption of an established gut microbiome is associated with diseases ranging from obesity, diabetes, and allergies to intestinal bowel disease.",
            "It is therefore critical to understand the factors that can disrupt or alter the microbiota.",
            "Factors such as stress, diet and genetics are known to affect the microbiota, and, increasingly, studies indicate a role for environmental toxicants as well.",
            "Toxicants in the environment can directly harm the components of the microbiota, but can also be modified by the microbiota to be more or less toxic to the host and/or the microbiota itself.",
            "The microbiota of the gut occupies a niche at the interface of the external environment and host epithelium which makes it a prime target for monitoring environmental exposures.",
            "If there are taxa especially sensitive to environmental pollutants, monitoring changes to the microbiota could yield biomarkers of exposure.",
            "Several studies have begun to explore how different environmental toxicants, such as metals, interact with the microbiota specifically.",
            "Metals can be highly reactive, and both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have evolved mechanisms to take advantage of and to protect themselves from exposure.",
            "For example, the reactivity of some metals, like iron, manganese, and cobalt, make them useful as cofactors in enzymes to help catalyze reactions.",
            "In addition, there are a number of cellular transport systems, binding proteins, and conjugation pathways to limit exposures and unwanted effects from both essential and non-essential metals.",
            "The doses necessary to overwhelm these homeostatic mechanisms vary by organism and environment, and levels that may be toxic to some may have no, or even a beneficial effect, on others.",
            "As the microbiota experience the exposure prior to the host, how those microbes react to or affect the exposure has the potential to influence the host response.",
            "Metal exposures are an environmental and occupational hazard.",
            "The metals selected for this work, chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni), are widely distributed and some of the most utilized metals in industry, while arsenic (As) is a persistent public health threat found at high concentrations in drinking water in many areas.",
            "All five of these metals have been listed by IARC as Group I or II carcinogens.",
            "In addition, exposure can lead to adverse health effects in target organs such as the liver, kidney, and lungs, although they are thought to act via different mechanisms and biochemical pathways.",
            "Exposures to metal compounds have been shown to alter the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota.",
            "For example, in one study, either cadmium or lead in drinking water alter mouse gut microbiota by increasing Lachnospiraceae abundance, while a different study found that cadmium in water increased growth of Bacteroidetes relative to Firmicutes in mice.",
            "Another mouse study found that cadmium exposure led to a relative increase in Verrucomicrobia.",
            "Chickens fed nickel-supplemented feed had increased prevalence of E. coli and Enterococcuss species.",
            "Studies examining alterations in the microbial composition after arsenic exposure have shown results that appear to conflict.",
            "Guo et al. found that providing mice water containing arsenic increased the abundance of Firmicutes and decreased the abundance of Bacteroidetes.",
            "However, Dheer et al. found that arsenic exposure caused an increase in Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Firmicutes.",
            "In another mouse study, drinking arsenic-containing water caused a decrease in the prevalence of the class Clostridia (in the phylum Firmicutes).",
            "Most studies use the animal\u2019s food or water as the source of exposure, which can lead to variable dosing of individuals.",
            "In addition, these studies tend to look at changes after long periods of exposure, potentially missing important early changes to the microbiota.",
            "To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of metal exposure on the gut microbiota, we exposed rats to three different oral doses of sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, cobalt chloride, sodium dichromate, or nickel chloride for five days (Fig.\u00a01).",
            "We profiled the gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing before and after exposure to identify the taxa most sensitive or resistant to the metal.",
            "We identified taxa and inferred gene inventories that are enriched or depleted after metal exposure, detailing how each metal altered the microbiota.",
            "This information is likely to prove useful from a health monitoring standpoint if some taxa can serve as indicators of low/sub-clinical exposures that are not immediately harmful but could become so over time.",
            "Further, this design allowed us to identify early responses to metal exposures, such as enrichment of certain taxa or genes, which could be beneficial to the host and/or the microbiota in adapting to the higher levels of metal and that could be exploited to craft a therapeutic strategy.",
            "Results",
            "Cohorts of five rats were exposed to three different doses of sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, sodium dichromate, cobalt chloride, or nickel chloride by oral gavage for five consecutive days.",
            "Fecal pellets were collected before the initial exposure and 24\u2009hours after the final exposure.",
            "DNA from the fecal pellets was isolated, and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using degenerate primers to the flanking conserved regions and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq.",
            "We recovered 14,703,356 reads from one multiplexed run containing the sequencing libraries for all of the samples.",
            "After joining paired-end reads, 11,127,881 sequences remained.",
            "Demultiplexing, quality filtering, and removal of chimeric sequences left 8,357,686 sequences.",
            "Samples with less than the minimum reads for inclusion (3,544, see methods) were excluded from the analysis.",
            "This left 279 samples, with an average of 15,317 sequences/sample.",
            "Overview of Changes in Microbiome Composition",
            "Reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% similarity using the QIIME pipeline and assigned a taxonomic designation using the Greengenes v13.8 database.",
            "Across the entire data set, 99% of the OTUs could be assigned to a phylum, 86% could be assigned to a family, and 39% could be assigned to a named genus.",
            "The drop-off in assignments at the genus level is in part due to the large percentage of OTUs belonging to the S24-7 family, which does not have a clearly resolved phylogeny below the family level and consequently does not have associated genera in the Greengenes v13.8 database.",
            "Figure\u00a02 summarizes the abundances of taxa at the phylum, order and genus levels.",
            "The pre-exposure samples (Day 0) and post-exposure control samples (water control) have generally similar proportions of the major phyla.",
            "The cohorts all have roughly equal amounts of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, which together comprise on average 92% of the total bacteria across all samples and are known common components of the mammalian gut microbiota.",
            "A small amount of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria is also present in most controls.",
            "Notably, the samples from the nickel cohort (including pre-exposure and control samples) are well distinguished from the other control samples by the presence of Verrucomicrobia and Tenericutes, which collectively make up around 10% of the bacteria in the nickel control samples (see discussion for further details).",
            "Phylum level changes in the gut microbiota were induced to varying degrees by each of the metals tested, particularly at the highest dose level.",
            "Proteobacteria increased in prevalence in response to each metal except for cadmium.",
            "Verrucomicrobia increased in cadmium, cobalt and chromium exposed samples despite not being a major presence in the control samples for these metals.",
            "In contrast, the Verrucomicrobia in the nickel control samples appear to have been reduced after exposure.",
            "The nickel exposure also seems to have nearly eliminated the Bacteroidetes family S24-7, which is the most prevalent Bacteroidetes family in the other samples and is prevalent in rat gut microbiota generally.",
            "Interestingly, the decline of family S24-7 in nickel-exposed samples was accompanied by an increase in the presence of other non-S24-7 Bacteroidetes.",
            "Proteobacteria, specifically bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, also greatly increased after nickel exposure.",
            "Overall, the pattern of changes in microbiome composition after metal exposure tended to be specific to a particular metal, though the majority of the genera affected (with the exception of those identified in the nickel exposures) had altered abundances in multiple metals (Fig.\u00a03).",
            "While there were some qualitatively similar changes, such as an increase in Proteobacteria, the scale of the change varied between metals, and no consistent patterns at any taxonomic level were observed across all metals.",
            "Alpha Diversity",
            "Plots of the within sample (or \u201calpha\u201d) diversity across cohorts (Fig.\u00a04, top row) show the average number of OTUs observed in samples pre- and post-exposure.",
            "Samples taken from animals after exposure to arsenic, chromium, and nickel trended towards lower numbers of observed OTUs relative to their respective post-exposure control.",
            "Similar results were observed using Faith\u2019s phylogenetic distance (PD) and Shannon\u2019s diversity, an alpha diversity metric that incorporates the evenness and abundance of different OTUs (Fig.\u00a04).",
            "One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates dose is a significant factor determining observed OTUs and PD among day 5 arsenic, chromium and nickel samples (p\u2009<\u20090.05).",
            "Dose was also a significant contributor to Shannon\u2019s diversity in arsenic and chromium samples (p\u2009<\u20090.05).",
            "Despite reduced alpha diversity metrics in the arsenic, chromium and nickel treatments, the large within treatment variability makes firm conclusions difficult.",
            "Beta Diversity",
            "As another means of identifying changes in the microbiota induced by metal exposure, we performed a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of all samples in our study using the Bray-Curtis distance metric on OTUs identified by QIIME (Fig.\u00a05).",
            "Axis 1 captures 23% of the total variance, separating the entire nickel cohort from the remaining samples, and separating the post-exposure samples from pre-exposure samples for the other metals.",
            "Axis 2 separates the pre-exposure samples from each other (apart from nickel) and separates the post- from pre-exposure nickel samples.",
            "The nickel cohorts, including the pre-exposure samples are well separated from the rest of the samples along axis 1.",
            "Pre- and post-exposure samples from different metals tended to cluster apart, emphasizing the uniqueness of responses to different metal exposures.",
            "However, exposure caused a shift along axis 1 in the same direction for each metal except for nickel, suggesting some aspects of the response is shared.",
            "One potential candidate is the phylum Verrucomicrobia, which increases in abundance after exposure to cadmium, cobalt and chromium.",
            "A qualitatively similar result was obtained using the UniFrac distance method, which incorporates phylogenetic information when determining distance between OTUs (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1).",
            "We tested for significant differences in beta diversity between pre- and post-exposure samples within a cohort, and between post-exposure controls and treated samples using the PERMANOVA test on OTU tables.",
            "The PERMANOVA results (R2 (effect size) and p values) are shown in Table\u00a01.",
            "Because the PERMANOVA test is sensitive to differences in variance, we performed a multivariate test for equality of variances using the \u201cbetadisper\u201d function from the vegan R package, in addition to the PERMANOVA.",
            "Only three comparisons (out of 35) showed a significant result (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Table\u00a01, \u201cBetadisper P\u201d), indicating most significant PERMANOVA results are due to a change in mean and not variance.",
            "For each of the metals, the differences in pre- and post-exposure water controls were not significant (Table\u00a01, column 3), suggesting no effect due to experimental manipulation (gavage).",
            "Each post-exposure treatment group from the arsenic, cadmium and nickel experiments were significantly different from the post-exposure control group (Table\u00a01, column 1).",
            "Only the chromium high dose group was significantly different from the chromium control, and no significant differences were observed due to cobalt exposure.",
            "The size of exposure effects (R2) varied between treatments, with the largest effect seen in the nickel high dose treatment group (R2\u2009=\u20090.55), and the smallest significant effect seen in the chromium high dose treatment group (R2\u2009=\u20090.22).",
            "In addition, we tested if metal treatments showed a significant, dose-dependent effect on microbiota composition, where each dose must induce a significant change from lower doses, and not just a change from the control (see methods for details).",
            "Arsenic, cadmium, and nickel all show dose dependent effects at each dose (Table\u00a01, column 2).",
            "In summary, cobalt and chromium treatments showed little effect on microbiota composition, while arsenic, cadmium and nickel significantly altered microbiota composition in a dose-dependent manner.",
            "Differential Abundance of Taxa",
            "We identified taxa with different abundances in post-exposure treated samples relative to vehicle controls.",
            "Figure\u00a06 shows a heat map of all genera that had significantly different abundances (Wald test, p\u2009<\u20090.05) in at least one comparison.",
            "In total, the abundances of 47 genera were affected by at least one metal exposure.",
            "Exposure to nickel showed the most pronounced effect with changes in abundance to 37 genera, of which 25 were uniquely affected by this metal.",
            "In contrast, only one genus was identified as changing in the cobalt cohort.",
            "Figure\u00a03 shows the overlap of significantly different genera among the metals.",
            "Differential Abundance of Genes and Gene Pathways",
            "We estimated the relative abundance of genes and biological pathways using the PICRUSt tool (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states).",
            "This tool estimates the gene content of a bacterial assemblage based on the bacteria identified by 16S rDNA sequencing.",
            "Pathways, based on KEGG annotations, are then identified using this inferred gene inventory.",
            "The nearest sequenced taxon index (NSTI), a measure of PICRUSt accuracy, was 0.168+/\u2212 0.059 (mean+/\u2212 SD).",
            "This high value is somewhat worse relative to other mammalian microbiota studies, but this is likely due to the high abundance of reads from family S24-7, which, as mentioned, does not have a clearly resolved phylogeny.",
            "The nickel cohort, for example, has a much lower NSTI (0.079+/\u2212 0.036), and very low abundance of S24-7.",
            "Removing the S24-7 reads in all day 5 samples causes the NSTI to drop to 0.104+/\u2212 0.033.",
            "To identify genes and gene pathways that significantly differentiate post-exposure control from post-exposure treated samples, we used Linear Discriminant Analysis of Effect Size (LEfSe).",
            "This program first identifies differentially abundant pathways and then performs a linear discriminant analysis to rank the pathways by their ability to discriminate two or more groups (in the case of our analysis, post-exposure samples and controls).",
            "Out of 6,909 KEGG orthologs, 926 were found to be significantly altered post-exposure, meeting the default criteria of LEfSe (a Kruskal-Wallis p-value\u2009<\u20090.05, and linear discriminant analysis score of \u22652).",
            "Many of these were metal specific, as shown in Supplementary Fig.",
            "S2. Significantly different KEGG pathways are shown as cladograms in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3.",
            "Discussion",
            "The knowledge of the importance of the microbiome to human health has increased in recent years, yet the role that the microbiome plays in toxic response has not fully been elucidated.",
            "It is well known that microbial metabolism of xenobiotics can affect the toxicity of different compounds, but previous efforts in this area have not considered how the dynamic response and changes of the microbiota to the toxicant may alter the metabolic potential of the host microbiome.",
            "Further, these toxicant-induced changes to the microbiome may themselves induce host effects independently from the toxicant.",
            "In an effort to better understand the role of the microbiome in response to metal exposures, we have undertaken a study to examine the compositional changes of the fecal microbiota of metal-exposed mice using 16S-rRNA gene analysis.",
            "We then utilized bioinformatics techniques to infer metabolic changes in response to these exposures.",
            "We have shown that exposure to nickel, arsenic, or cadmium by oral gavage significantly alters gut microbiota composition, while chromium and cobalt at the tested doses have only modest effects.",
            "The nickel, arsenic, and cadmium treatments showed a dose dependent effect on microbiota diversity.",
            "This suggests that the exposures occurred within a range of doses where the microbiota is sensitive and responding to the specific metal and that the changes we observed were not due to a generalized stress response in the rats.",
            "Interestingly, despite the lack of strong effects on the microbiota composition due to cobalt or chromium exposures, these exposures resulted in decreased weight and in accumulation of metals in the liver and kidney (Madejczyk et al., manuscript in preparation).",
            "These metals therefore had a physiological effect on the animals, but only a modest effect on the microbiota.",
            "It should also be noted that rats were housed 2-3 animals per cage, and each cage received the same treatment.",
            "This design introduces potential cage effects, which can confound microbiota analyses.",
            "However, since two cages were used per treatment, similar biases would likely have to be present in both cages to produce the significant differences we see.",
            "This is unlikely given that cage effects are generally thought to be random.",
            "The gut microbiota varied even among the inbred and co-housed rats that served as controls in this study (See Figs\u00a04 and 5).",
            "This is unsurprising given that inter-individual variation is commonly reported to be high in microbiota surveys.",
            "While the arsenic, cadmium, and cobalt control samples cluster together, the chromium controls form their own cluster adjacent to these three metals, and the nickel controls are well separated from all other controls (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4 showing just the control exposures).",
            "Despite this initial variation between cohorts, the variation within cohorts after five days of sham exposure was relatively constant (see Figs\u00a04 and 5 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4), suggesting the microbiota was stable over the course of the experiment.",
            "The cohort of rats used for the nickel exposures were purchased from the same vendor as the other studies but originated from a different colony at that vendor\u2019s facility, which likely explains the differences from the other cohorts.",
            "Fortunately, cohort-matched controls were included with each metal exposure, so the statistical comparison included animals originating from a single colony.",
            "Thus, colony source is unlikely to affect the significant differences we observed.",
            "Our findings highlight the breadth of variation in individual microbiota, which can complicate the search for signatures of exposure.",
            "For example, the phylum Verrucomicrobia increased in response to cadmium exposure (Fig.\u00a02), but was already present in the pre-exposure nickel cohort at a comparable amount.",
            "Tracking relative changes in taxa abundance may be required for any effort to identify signatures of metal exposure based purely on compositional analyses, as the initial composition of real world samples of interest are bound to be highly variable.",
            "As in previous studies, we found that exposure to metal compounds significantly altered the gut microbiota composition (Fig.\u00a05, Table\u00a01).",
            "However, the specific changes and trends reported are not always similar.",
            "Guo et al. reported an increase in Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and a decrease in Bacteroidetes after arsenic exposure, which is consistent with changes we observed in the two lowest doses (Fig.\u00a02).",
            "Our highest dose also showed an increase in Proteobacteria, but not Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes.",
            "Guo et al. also report a decrease in TM7, however, this phylum was prevalent in their control population but nearly absent in our own controls.",
            "Breton et al. found that cadmium increased Lachnospiraceae abundance in mice, but we saw no difference in our own study.",
            "Liu observed that Bacteroidetes increased in abundance relative to Firmicutes after cadmium exposure, which, again, we did not find.",
            "While it is encouraging that some of the trends we observed were also observed by others, it is also clear that there are many discrepancies.",
            "Metal exposure has been shown, by this paper and others, to alter gut microbiota compositions, but the specific taxa affected are not consistent.",
            "There are many potential sources of variability that could explain these discrepancies, including variation in the starting microbiota, exposure regimen (drinking water, oral gavage, etc.), time-frame of exposure, dose effects, feed composition, and technical differences in the processing and analysis of samples.",
            "We sought to limit these sources of variability as much as possible.",
            "For example, the feed used has a similar macronutrient breakdown to feed used in other studies, and is unlikely to alter the microbiome (see methods).",
            "A distinctive feature of our work is the use of a range of doses, and measuring their effects relatively early in the exposure.",
            "In addition, we used oral gavage, instead of spiking the food or water, to control the dose each animal received.",
            "We are therefore more likely to identify the changes most sensitive to metal exposure.",
            "Another serious consideration is the strength of compositional analysis when looking at higher level taxa to elucidating signatures of exposure.",
            "The sensitivity or resistance of an individual microbe to a given toxicant is determined at the gene or functional level.",
            "Species and even strain level differences may be due to genetic changes that alter sensitivity to a given toxicant.",
            "Therefore, we sought to identify functional changes within the microbiota using bioinformatics analysis to infer gene composition.",
            "The changes in microbial composition that we observed after metal exposure are likely related to the functional capabilities of the microbes that effect sensitivity to the toxicant or response to changes in the host.",
            "While we cannot directly measure these capabilities, we can infer them based on genomic sequence.",
            "The genes and biological pathways that were differentially abundant due to metal exposure potentially represent important mechanisms in microbial responses to the metal.",
            "One example that we observed was an increased presence of orthologs to the three genes that encode the bacterial, iron ABC-transporter system.",
            "Specifically, genes encoding the permease, ATP-binding protein, and the siderophore-binding protein (KEGG orthology groups K02013, K02015, and K02016) were significantly overrepresented in the arsenic and nickel treated samples.",
            "Figure\u00a07 shows the relative proportion of each of these KEGG orthology groups across metal treatments.",
            "Bacteria containing the iron complex transport system may have increased in relative abundance due to the system\u2019s capacity to interact with metals generally.",
            "Bacterial iron importing mechanisms often can import nickel as well.",
            "Siderophores have been found to also bind nickel, alleviating toxicity due to excess nickel exposure.",
            "Further, iron has been observed to mitigate the effects of arsenic toxicity, so bacteria with orthologs to these iron-harvesting genes may have an advantage when growing in the presence of arsenic.",
            "Interestingly, even though the overall composition of the nickel and arsenic control samples were very different, the relative abundance of the genes was similar.",
            "The genes increased in frequency in response to higher doses, and this increase was not due to the relative increase of a particular taxa shared by the arsenic and nickel groups.",
            "Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5 shows the contribution of different taxa to the abundance of the siderophore-binding protein (KEGG ortholog K02016) in the high dose arsenic and nickel samples.",
            "Similar results were seen for the other two orthologs in this complex.",
            "The Proteobacteria phylum, and specifically the Enterobactericeae family, increased in response to both arsenic and nickel treatments.",
            "However, while Enterobacteriaceae was a major contributor to the prevalence of the iron complex transport system in nickel treated samples, it was only present in three of the arsenic treated samples (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5).",
            "Instead, the family S24-7 and Ruminococcaceae were the main contributors but were virtually absent from the nickel treated samples.",
            "These finding shows the importance of characterizing the functional capacity of microbiota in addition to identifying changes in taxonomic composition.",
            "While different taxa changed in abundance due to arsenic and nickel exposure (Fig.\u00a06), the functional analysis indicates a common set of orthologous genes increased in both sets of samples.",
            "Exposure to these metals likely created a niche where bacteria with increased repertoires of genes that mitigate metal toxicity thrived.",
            "The taxa providing these genes differed between treatments, presumably reflecting the different taxa present in the cohorts pre-exposure.",
            "This may also explain different responses to metals observed by others.",
            "The specific taxa we observe changing in response to metals may differ from other reports, but could be filling similar functional niches.",
            "Better characterization of the functional capacity of the microbiotas, for example through whole genome sequencing and metabolomics, will be required to test this idea further.",
            "In summary, we have shown that dose dependent alteration in the microbiota can be observed and measured after exposure to the heavy metals arsenic, cadmium and nickel.",
            "This sets the ground work for the use of changes in bacterial composition as a potential biomarker of exposure.",
            "However, it must be noted, that compositional changes at higher taxonomic levels (e.g. phylum) are unlikely to be specific, as indicated by the different responses observed for the same metal across different studies.",
            "By drilling down to the functional level of the gene and gene pathway, metal-specific adaptions of the microbiota can be observed.",
            "In this work, we identified a role for siderophore-importing orthologs in response to nickel and arsenic exposure, but the bacterial composition producing this response was different for each metal.",
            "As these adaptive responses are better characterized, the metabolic effects of the microbiota on toxicity and the direct effects of the microbiome on health can be better elucidated.",
            "The microbiota shows promise as a biomarker of exposure, but future work will be required to identify the functional and metabolic components most useful as a biomarker.",

            "Semen Quality and Reproductive Health of Young Czech Men Exposed to Seasonal Air Pollution",
            "This study of male reproductive health in the Czech Republic resulted from community concern about potential adverse effects of air pollution.",
            "We compared young men (18 years of age) living in Teplice, a highly industrialized district with seasonally elevated levels of air pollution, to those from Prachatice, a rural district with relatively clean air.",
            "Surveys were scheduled for either late winter, after the season of higher air pollution, or at the end of summer, when pollution was low.",
            "Participation included a physical examination, donation of a semen sample, and completion of a questionnaire on health, personal habits, and exposure to solvents and metals through work or hobby.",
            "Analysis of data from 408 volunteers showed that the men from Teplice and Prachatice were similar in physical characteristics, personal habits, and work-or hobby-related exposures.",
            "Sixty-six percent (272) of these men donated a single semen sample for routine semen analysis, computer-aided sperm motion analysis, and sperm chromatin structure assay.",
            "The mean (median) sperm concentration and sperm count were 61.2 (44.0) million/mL semen and 113.3 (81.5) million, respectively, and were not associated with district of residence or period of elevated air pollution.",
            "However, periods of elevated air pollution in Teplice were significantly associated with decrements in other semen measures including proportionately fewer motile sperm, proportionately fewer sperm with normal morphology or normal head shape, and proportionately more sperm with abnormal chromatin.",
            "These results suggest that young men may experience alterations in sperm quality after exposure to periods of elevated air pollution, without changes in sperm numbers.",
            "Air pollution in the Czech Republic increased dramatically with the advent of industrialization in the 1950s, primarily the result of increasing use of brown coal (with high sulfur content) for both home heating and industry.",
            "Sulfur dioxide emissions in Czechoslovakia amounted to 0.9 million tons in the 1950s and increased to 3.5 million tons by 1985 (1).",
            "This increase was particularly pronounced in the mountainous region of Northern Bohemia, where coal comes from mammoth open-pit mines and is used to heat homes and generate power for local industry.",
            "During the 1980s, ambient SO 2 levels associated with high levels of particulate matter (PM) in the Teplice district of Northern Bohemia frequently exceeded U.S. and Czech air pollution standards (2,3) in winter, when the use of coal increases and thermal inversions favor retention of the air pollution in the valley (4).",
            "The Teplice Program, an international research program, was initiated in 1991 in response to concerns over potential health effects of this pollution.",
            "This program sponsored cooperative research among the Czech Institute of Hygiene, the Czech Ministry of the Environment, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to compare health status in Teplice district to that in Prachatice district (5).",
            "We chose Prachatice because of its relatively cleaner air.",
            "A critical component of this program was the establishment of air monitoring in both districts to measure aerosol and gas-phase air pollutants [PM, including volatile and semivolatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and toxic metals] as well as SO 2 , nitrous oxides (NO x ), and carbon monoxide on an ongoing basis.",
            "Monitoring confirmed that levels of these air pollutants were considerably higher in Teplice than in Prachatice, and were higher in the winter than during the rest of the year in both districts (5,6).",
            "The Teplice Program includes studies of a number of health outcomes, including respiratory and neurologic effects in children, biomonitoring of mutagens in adults, and reproductive health in pregnant women and young men (5).",
            "Reproductive health studies were prompted by reports that rates of conception and incidence of congenital anomalies were affected by seasonal increases in air pollution (7).",
            "To examine the potential relationship between the season of elevated air pollution and male reproductive health, we surveyed young (18-year-old) men and evaluated their semen quality.",
            "Metabolites of the PAHs present in this industrial air pollution can form protein or DNA adducts in body tissues (8) and thus have the potential to damage germ cell DNA.",
            "PAHs also reportedly alter male reproductive function in test species (9,10), providing additional rationale for this study.",
            "Furthermore, metals such as lead and cadmium that are present in the particulate fraction of air pollution have been associated with decrements in human semen quality (11).",
            "Methods",
            "This project was a collaborative effort between Czech and U.S. scientists.",
            "The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Regional Institute of Hygiene of Central Bohemia, Prague, Czech Republic.",
            "Subject recruitment.",
            "All young men turning 18 in the two districts over the 6 months before sampling were sent a letter from their district Hygiene Station with an appointment for a physical examination.",
            "Appointments were scheduled within 1 week's time in either early fall (1993) or late winter (1993 and 1994) to allow comparisons between recent exposures to periods of either high (winter) or low (summer) pollution.",
            "When each man presented for his physical examination, the reproductive study was explained to him, including his right to decline to participate and/or donate a semen sample, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.",
            "No financial incentive was provided for participation.",
            "A pilot study was conducted in fall 1992 to estimate participation levels, establish field methods for the laboratory measures, and field test the questionnaire.",
            "Because methods for recruiting the participants in the pilot study differed from those used in the main study, data from the pilot study are not included in this report.",
            "However, a preliminary summary report of the study findings included the pilot data (5).",
            "Questionnaire, physical examination, and semen sampling.",
            "The Czech study team traveled to the Teplice and Prachatice District Institutes of Hygiene for each sampling cycle (5 days) with the necessary supplies and equipment.",
            "Data were collected by questionnaire, physical examination, and semen sampling.",
            "A structured questionnaire, customized for use in the Czech Republic, was given by two trained interviewers.",
            "The purpose of the questionnaire was to obtain information on health status; other exposures such as metals, solvents, or pesticides encountered through hobbies or work (for those men undertaking apprenticeships); lifestyle data; and reproductive history including the date of last semen emission.",
            "Questions on other factors that could affect semen quality (such as fever, medications, exposure to X rays, cigarette use, consumption of alcohol and caffeinated beverages, and use of briefs) covered the previous 3 months.",
            "The physical examination included a urogenital evaluation and determination of testis volume based on caliper measures of testis length and width.",
            "A single semen sample was collected on site by masturbation and sperm were videotaped within 1 hr of collection for subsequent motility analysis.",
            "Routine semen analysis included semen volume, sperm concentration [determined by hemocytometer according to World Health Organization guidelines; WHO (12)], total number of sperm per sample, percentage of motile sperm, percentage of sperm with normal morphology (entire cell considered), and percentage with normal head morphology.",
            "For the morphology assessment, we evaluated 300 sperm per sample from air-dried Papanicolaou-stained preparations and classified as either normal or abnormal according to strict criteria (12).",
            "The remaining semen was aliquoted into small tubes or straws, snap frozen on dry ice, and archived at -70\u00b0C.",
            "Computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA).",
            "Within 1 hr of collection, an aliquot of semen was diluted at least 1:1 with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline to obtain a concentration suitable for CASA analysis (13), loaded into a 20-micron-deep chamber (Microcell, Fertility Technologies, Inc., Natick, MA), placed on a stage warmer set to 37\u00b0C, and videotaped (10\u00d7 negative phase contrast with green filter).",
            "Video images were evaluated using a Hamilton-Thorne Integrated visual optical system (HTM-IVOS) semen analyzer (version 10.6; Hamilton-Thorne Research, Inc., Beverly, MA).",
            "We analyzed each field for 30 frames at 60 frames/second with minimum track length set at 20 points and examined enough fields to obtain velocity measures on at least 100 motile sperm.",
            "For oligospermic samples with < 100 motile sperm on the tape, mean velocities are included only when \u2265 25 motile sperm were analyzed.",
            "We visually determined the percentage of motile sperm from the videotapes after scoring at least 100 sperm per sample.",
            "Because of technical difficulties, videotapes were unavailable for 10 men evaluated on 1 day in the Teplice (the late winter 1993 group).",
            "CASA outcomes include indicators of a) sperm progression: straight-line velocity (VSL), straightness (STR = VSL/VAP \u00d7 100, where VAP is the average velocity along a mathematically smoothed sperm path), and linearity (LIN = VSL/VCL \u00d7 100, where VCL is the curvilinear velocity); and b) vigor: curvilinear velocity (VCL), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), and beat cross frequency (BCF), as described in detail elsewhere (14).",
            "Some of these outcomes have been associated with fertility status (15)(16)(17)(18) and have been affected by occupational exposures (19,20).",
            "We also calculated two composite outcomes: the total number of motile sperm per sample (sperm count \u00d7 %motile) and the total number of progressive sperm per sample (total motile \u00d7 an index of progressive motility defined as percent of motile sperm with VSL 25 microns/second or greater).",
            "Sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA).",
            "Archived semen was shipped to South Dakota State University (Brookings, SD) for analysis using the SCSA, a measure of sperm nuclear integrity (21)(22)(23).",
            "Briefly, thawed and diluted semen was incubated for 30 sec in acid (pH 1.2) to potentially denature nuclear DNA, then immediately stained with the metachromatic dye, acridine orange (AO).",
            "AO intercalated into native double stranded DNA fluoresces green; AO complexed with single stranded DNA fluoresces red.",
            "We used flow cytometry to detect green (515-530 nm band pass filter) and red (630 nm long pass filter) fluorescence in 5,000 individual sperm per sample.",
            "The presence of DNA denaturation in each cell was observed as a shift from green to red fluorescence and was quantitated by the expression \"\u03b1 t ,\" defined as the ratio of red/(red + green) fluorescence.",
            "We used the \"cells outside the main population\" (COMP \u03b1 t ) variable, which represents the percentage of cells containing denatured DNA.",
            "Normal sperm chromatin is resistant to acid induced DNA denaturation and fluoresces green.",
            "Increased red fluorescence indicates abnormal chromatin packaging and/or DNA damage.",
            "High COMP \u03b1 t values have been associated with spermatogenic disorders and infertility (21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28).",
            "Air pollution data and exposure categories.",
            "Air pollution data were provided by I. Benes \u02d8and R. Stevens from the air monitoring program of the Teplice Project (5,6).",
            "These data include particulate matter < 10 \u00b5m in aerodynamic diameter (PM 10 ) obtained using the versatile air pollution sampler [VAPS (5,6)], PM-total suspended particulates (TSP), SO 2 , CO, and NO x .",
            "Because VAPS data were incomplete for earlier phases of the study, we present both VAPS and TSP data.",
            "The correlation between TSP and PM 10 was very high (r = 0.96, p = < 0.01, n =171) for those days where both were available.",
            "SO 2 data (an indicator of coal-derived pollution) were more complete than PM data.",
            "PM 10 levels were significantly correlated with SO 2 (r = 0.81, p < 0.01, n = 274), with NO x (r = 0.58, p < 0.01, n = 274), and CO (r = 0.49, p < 0.01, n = 252).",
            "The process of spermatogenesis involves a series of complex steps (stem cell replication, meiosis, and spermiogenesis) over approximately 74 days in humans (29,30).",
            "Epididymal transit time [estimated at 3-12 days (31)] and abstinence interval (controlled in the analysis) can add several weeks to the time before mature sperm are ejaculated.",
            "Thus an exposure period of approximately 90 days is generally accepted as being of sufficient duration for detecting effects on any stage of spermatogeneis when using semen measures as the biologic end points.",
            "Therefore, for purposes of estimating and categorizing exposures relevant to seasonal changes in air pollution, the air pollution data for the 90-day period preceding sampling were considered relevant.",
            "Examination of the mean levels of pollutants (Table 1) shows that they were uniformly low in the 90 days preceding the fall sampling periods in both districts and in the late winter sampling period in Prachatice in 1994, and somewhat higher preceding the late winter sampling in Prachatice in 1993.",
            "Because all mean values were well below both U.S. (3) and Czech standards (2), and individual values rarely, if ever, exceeded air quality standards, we considered these to be periods of low air pollution for the purposes of this study.",
            "In contrast, the mean levels of air pollutants were considerably higher in Teplice during the 90 days preceding the late winter samplings (Table 1), with 1993 levels considerably higher than 1994 levels.",
            "Furthermore, individual daily values frequently exceeded air quality standards.",
            "For descriptive purposes, we therefore considered winter 1993 in Teplice as a period of high air pollution and the winter of 1994 in Teplice as a period of medium air pollution.",
            "Air pollution peaks were episodic; severe episodes lasted a few days to a week (6).",
            "If such an episode were to affect a particular cell type in the testes, the time between exposure and sampling would be important in detecting that effect.",
            "Because the time between severe episodes and sampling was different in the winters of 1993 and 1994, the exposure/effect relationship could also be different.",
            "Consequently, a clear cut exposure-response relationship would not necessarily be expected.",
            "Therefore, the high and medium exposure periods were analyzed as dummy variables so as not to impose a linear exposure-response relationship.",
            "Furthermore, season of semen collection has also been associated with sperm concentration (32) and some measures of sperm motility and morphology (33), and needs to be considered when interpreting any associations between periods of elevated air pollution and semen outcomes.",
            "Statistical analyses.",
            "We entered all data into SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and calculated summary statistics.",
            "Initially we used the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests for unadjusted comparisons between the two districts and the three exposures.",
            "We conducted multivariable regression in tiers: first, differences for each outcome were examined by district, then by season, and finally by exposure categories.",
            "In addition, season was considered a potential confounder, because it is related to exposure in these communities, for those outcomes with a priori data suggesting an association with season (32,33).",
            "Outcome data were analyzed as continuous variables after transformation as needed to correct for nonnormal distribution: Log (count, concentration, number of progressive sperm, and SCSA COMP\u03b1 t ); square root [percent sperm with normal morphology, percent sperm with morphologically normal heads, semen volume, and curvilinear velocity (CASA)].",
            "In all analyses we assessed risk factors known or suspected to be associated with poor semen quality (34) for inclusion in the models.",
            "Factors considered included sexual abstinence [< 2 days vs. longer (35,36)], high fever (> 38\u00b0C) within the last 3 months, wearing briefs vs. loose-fitting underwear, alcohol consumption (0-25 mL ethanol/ week, 25-199 mL/week, or \u2265 200 mL/week), cigarette smoking [none, < one pack/day, or \u2265 1 pack/day (37)], caffeine consumption [< 1/2 coffee cup equivalents, 1/2-3 cups, or \u2265 3 cup/day (38)], and hobby or work with solvents (\u2265 10 hr/week vs. less) or with metals (\u2265 10 hr/week vs. less).",
            "The volume of ethanol was estimated based on the self-reported numbers of servings of beer, wine, or liquor consumed per week and the serving size (which is regulated precisely in the Czech Republic and determines the amount of alcohol per drink).",
            "We considered other factors such as the use of medications or the presence of genital tract conditions found by physical examination or by questionnaire, but the number of men affected was too small to be informative, and all of the men presented semen within the range of normal values as specified by the WHO (12).",
            "Results",
            "Participation and description of the study group.",
            "Sixty-one percent of those men who were sent appointment notices came to the study center for their physical examination and completed the questionnaire portion of the study (408 of 670).",
            "Reasons for missing the appointment were not ascertained but are unlikely to affect response to the request for Articles \u2022 Human semen quality and air pollution Environmental Health Perspectives semen samples because the appointment notice did not specifically mention a reproductive health assessment.",
            "Of the men who completed the physical and questionnaire, 67% (273) agreed to provide a semen sample.",
            "One specimen container leaked, which left a total of 272 semen samples available for analysis.",
            "Based on physical examination and questionnaire data, men from Teplice and Prachatice were similar with respect to descriptive factors (height, total testicular volume, age at first semen appearance, cigarette, and alcohol and caffeine consumption) (Table 2).",
            "The only differences by district were that on average, men in Prachatice weighed more than men in Teplice and were more likely to consume alcohol.",
            "None of the men were judged to be sexually immature on the basis of testis size or physical development.",
            "No differences were observed in any of these factors between those who were only interviewed and those who provided semen samples (Table 2).",
            "Table 3 shows other potential risk factors and confounders examined for inclusion in the regression models by exposure category.",
            "Of these, differences in distribution were noted for amount of alcohol and caffeine consumed per day and for the number of men with > 10 hr/week exposure to solvents or metals through work or hobbies.",
            "Several potential risk factors were present in the medical histories of only a few men (mumps, one case; injury to testes, one case; hydrocele, one case; and varicocele, six cases in men from Prachatice and two cases in men from Teplice).",
            "These cases were reviewed individually and because each had semen measures above the WHO reference values (39), none were excluded from the database.",
            "Semen quality.",
            "Semen volume and sperm numbers.",
            "The mean (median) semen volume for the entire group was 1.96 (1.80) mL and did not differ by district (Table 4).",
            "Two men were azospermic (0.5%) (one from each district) but neither was sampled after periods of medium or high pollution.",
            "There was no a priori reason to exclude them from the analysis; however, excluding them did not alter the sample median (data not shown).",
            "The mean (median) sperm concentration for all sampled men was 61.2 (44.0) million/mL semen (Table 4).",
            "The current WHO reference value for sperm concentration is \u2265 20 million/mL (39).",
            "In this group of men, 21% had sperm concentrations < 20 million/mL (21% in Teplice and 22% in Prachatice).",
            "No significant difference was observed by exposure category (Table 5).",
            "The duration of sexual abstinence in these young men averaged 4.6 days (\u00b1 4.4 days SD; range < 1-31 days), however, 18% were abstinent for < 2 days.",
            "Secondary analyses of abstinence data revealed that the best model to correct for short abstinence for this data set was < 2 days versus \u2265 2 days (40).",
            "After controlling for short abstinence, no relationship was found between sperm concentration or total sperm count and exposure to periods of medium or high air pollution (Table 6).",
            "Sperm motility and motion.",
            "In all samples, the average (mean) percentage of motile sperm was 33.6% (32.9%) and the mean for Prachatice donors was slightly, but significantly, higher than that for Teplice donors (Table 4).",
            "These mean values fall below the WHO reference value for percentage of motile sperm which is > 50% (38).",
            "Percent motile was also different by exposure category (Table 5).",
            "After controlling for appropriate lifestyle factors, the multivariable analysis showed a significant relationship between the percentage of motile sperm and a period of medium, but not high, air pollution; this relationship remained after control of confounding by season (Table 6).",
            "This decrease in percent motile sperm translates into a significant exposure-related association with the total number of motile sperm per sample and the total number of progressive sperm (VSL \u2265 25 \u00b5m/sec) for the medium exposure group (Table 6).",
            "However, after control for confounding by season, these associations were no longer significant.",
            "CASA measures the quality of motion of the motile population of sperm.",
            "Although data were generated for seven CASA parameters for each sperm track, some of these measures were significantly correlated with each other and therefore are not independent.",
            "For example, VAP was highly correlated with VSL (r = 0.94), STR was highly correlated with LIN (r = 0.85), and three vigor terms were highly correlated: ALH and BCF were highly correlated with VCL (r = 0.89 and r = 0.31, respectively).",
            "We selected three measures that describe different aspects of sperm motion: VSL (the absolute distance traveled over time), a measure of progression, VCL (the average point to point velocity), a measure of vigor, and LIN (VSL/VCL \u00d7 100), a measure of swimming pattern, and considered them individually.",
            "These measures are also relatively independent of the type of CASA instrument used; therefore, results for these measures are more readily compared with those in other studies.",
            "There were no associations between district of residence and any of these three measures (Tables 4 and6).",
            "In contrast, there was a   strong positive association between VSL and LIN, but not VCL, and season (Table 6), suggesting that sperm may swim faster and with straighter paths in the winter.",
            "Mean VSL was also higher in samples obtained after exposure to the season of high pollution (winter 1993) (Table 5), but the significance of this association disappeared after control for confounding by season (Table 6).",
            "Interestingly, VCL was also higher in this group of samples (Table 5), and this association remained significant (though relatively weak) after control for confounding by season (Tables 5 and6).",
            "This apparent increase in sperm vigor (VCL), without an increase in progression (VSL), resulted in lower mean LIN (Table 5) and a significant negative association between exposure and LIN (Table 6), apparently because mean VCL increased relatively more than mean VSL.",
            "With increases in both VSL and VCL, the decrease in LIN would not be considered a sign of weakened-sperm motility.",
            "In the samples obtained after exposure to periods of medium air pollution (winter 1994), mean VSL was unchanged but mean VCL was decreased (Table 5) compared to the reference group (periods of low air pollution), resulting in an apparently contradictory positive association between exposure and LIN (Tables 5 and6).",
            "These results may be biased by two factors that reduced the sample size for CASA analysis: a) 10 of 47 (31%) samples obtained in winter 1993 could not be analyzed by CASA because of technical problems; and b) samples with fewer than 25 motile sperm tracks were not included in the analyses because we did not consider means based on < 25 sperm to be representative of the sample.",
            "These samples without CASA data were distributed across exposure groups as follows: 21 of 160 or 13% in the low-exposure group, 3 of 63 or 5% in the medium-exposure group, and 6 of 47 or 13% in the high-exposure group.",
            "Sperm structure.",
            "The mean (\u00b1 SD) percentage of normal sperm for all samples was 17.8 \u00b1 8.0% (Table 4).",
            "The most recent WHO guidance (39) does not specify a reference value for this measure because multicenter population-based studies are underway to derive one using standardized strict criteria (as used in this study) for scoring each cell.",
            "Nevertheless, the guidance notes that as sperm morphology falls below 15% normal forms (using strict criteria for scoring sperm as normal), the fertilization rate in vitro decreases.",
            "We observed significant negative relationships between district of residence and/or exposure to periods of medium or high air pollution and the percent of sperm with overall normal morphology (considering head, midpiece, and tail) as well as the percent with normal head morphology (Tables 456).",
            "As demonstrated in Tables 4 and5, we observed significant differences by district alone and by air pollution category alone, but these outcomes were unrelated to season.",
            "In the multivariable regression analyses, both the percentage of normal sperm and the percentage of normal sperm heads were significantly  lower in men exposed to periods of medium or high pollution (Table 6).",
            "These differences remained after control of confounding by season.",
            "The decrement in percent normal sperm shows an increasing exposure-response relationship.",
            "However, the percent of normal sperm heads, albeit significantly decreased for both exposed periods, did not show an increasing exposure-response pattern, suggesting that alterations of sperm head shape may be a significant component of the sperm morphology effect but do not account for all of it.",
            "Analysis of the SCSA data focused on the COMP\u03b1 t variable, the percent of sperm with abnormal chromatin (i.e., demonstrating increased susceptibility to DNA denaturation in situ).",
            "COMP\u03b1 t was significantly higher in samples obtained after the period of high, but not medium, air pollution (Table 5) and this association remained significant in the multivariable analysis (Table 6).",
            "A longitudinal study with monthly semen samples for 45 men for a total of 8 sequential months suggests that SCSA measures do not vary by season (25); therefore, the analysis for COMP\u03b1 t did not include control for potential confounding by season.",
            "Discussion",
            "This study was undertaken to obtain a preliminary characterization of reproductive health in 18-year-old men who live in either of two districts in the Czech Republic.",
            "It was initiated because of community concern that living in the Teplice district, an area with periods of elevated air pollution during the winter (compared with the Prachatice district, an area with considerably lower air pollution), may be associated with increased abnormal reproductive health and/or poor semen quality.",
            "The data obtained are unusual in that all the men were young and of the same age when sampled.",
            "In addition, during these young men's lifetimes, movement between communities was uncommon.",
            "These demographics are advantageous when looking for effects related to environmental exposures because the young men in this study group would have had similar lifetime exposures to environmental pollution and would be less likely than older men to have experienced significant occupational exposures to reproductive toxicants.",
            "Furthermore, changes in semen quality known or suspected to occur with advancing age are not an issue in this study group.",
            "On the other hand, few comparison databases on semen quality exist for men of this age and they were too young to evaluate their fertility.",
            "Data obtained from the physical examination and questionnaire indicated that the young men living in Teplice were similar to those living in Prachatice with respect to physical characteristics, lifestyle, and general health.",
            "The physical examination revealed no evidence of delayed puberty; all men were sexually mature based on secondary sex characteristics.",
            "Furthermore, there were no differences by district in testicular volume or self-reported age at first semen appearance.",
            "We categorized exposure in this study based on mean levels of pollutants monitored during the 90 days preceding the sample collection.",
            "Monitoring methods have been described in detail elsewhere (6) along with more detailed analyses of source (industry vs. home heating) and components (specific PAHs and metals).",
            "These efforts documented that periods of elevated air pollution occurred in Teplice in the winters of 1993 and 1994, with conditions being worse in 1993.",
            "Analysis of representative samples of particulate matter for metal content indicated that ambient lead and cadmium levels were well below the existing standards for these metals.",
            "However, because internal measures of metal exposure were not available in the study participants and exposure to these metals has been associated with adverse effects on semen quality (11), a potential association between metals in the air pollution and adverse semen outcomes cannot be ruled out.",
            "However, the specific component(s) of the air pollution that may account for any adverse effects observed in this study were not identified.",
            "Although air measurements were made in one central location in each community, each individual's precise exposure to any component of the air pollution during the time period would be expected to depend on his location within the community, his activity patterns, and the weather conditions.",
            "The magnitude of exposure in the different sampling periods varied widely and was used to define periods of high, medium, or low air pollution for the purpose of analysis.",
            "If the important exposures are the peak levels, error may be introduced given the timing of these peaks within the 90-day period.",
            "Both the number of peaks and the time between the peaks and semen sampling varied between the two winters in Teplice.",
            "Because the ability to detect an effect of an acute exposure on a susceptible germ cell stage depends on the time the semen is sampled, such effects can be missed in a study such as this one, with only one sampling time.",
            "Also, an effect detected on a particular semen measure might be stronger one winter than the other, based on differences in the duration of the pollution episodes and the time between exposure and sampling.",
            "Thus, strict exposure-response relationships might not be expected.",
            "With these problems inherent in the study design, we considered each winter exposure period separately when making comparisons with the samples obtained after periods of relatively low exposures.",
            "Sperm concentrations and total sperm counts in these men, although not significantly associated with district, season, or exposure to periods of elevated air pollution, were at the low end of the ranges reported for populations of men worldwide (41).",
            "With respect to reference values for these measures provided by the WHO (39), 54% of these samples fell below 2.0 mL for semen volume, 21% fell below 20 million/mL for sperm concentration, and 28% fell below 40 million sperm/sample for total sperm count.",
            "Short abstinence intervals in young men could account for these observations.",
            "However, even after omitting samples from men reporting < 2 days sexual abstinence, the respective percentages are still relatively high: 51% below 2.0 mL, 19% below 20 million sperm/mL, and 21% below 40 million sperm/sample.",
            "This sperm concentration statistic is similar to that reported recently for a cohort of men in the United States consisting of partners of women presenting for infertility evaluation: 18% of the men had sperm concentrations < 20 million/mL (42).",
            "However, the mean sperm concentration of the Czech men (61.2 million/mL) was lower than that determined for this group of American men (94.4 million/mL) (42).",
            "Nevertheless, the median sperm concentration for the Czech men in this study (44.0 million/mL) is comparable to that recently reported for a cohort of unselected young Danish men [41.0 million/mL (43,44)], and both cohorts have lower median sperm concentrations when compared to a cohort of Finnish men without proven fertility [126.8 million/mL (41)].",
            "These reports strengthen the evidence for geographic (possibly genetic) differences in sperm concentrations in Europe, as have been reported in the United States (45).",
            "Exposure to environmental pollution may contribute to a perceived decline in sperm counts world wide (41)(42)(43)(44)(45)(46)(47).",
            "One recent report showed progressive declines in sperm production in Greece during a time period when air pollution increased (48).",
            "However, our results do not support a relationship between either district of residence or exposure to periods of elevated air pollution and decreased sperm production (concentration or sperm per sample) in the Czech Republic.",
            "Evidence from laboratory and wildlife populations indicates that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals during fetal or neonatal development may alter sexual differentiation, sperm production, and/or epididymal storage capability in adulthood (reviewed elsewhere by Toppari et al. (41) and Kavlock et al. (49).",
            "Air pollution since 1975-1996, when these men were born, has followed the same patterns by district and season observed during the years under study.",
            "Therefore, sperm counts might also differ by district if potential endocrine disruptors were present in the air pollution (49).",
            "Although our sample size is limited for detecting such effects, we found no evidence to support this hypothesis.",
            "However, this study does not address the possibility that other types of pollution present in the environment, or lifestyle factors such as consumption of alcohol and cigarettes from a relatively young age, might impact in general upon sperm production potential in young Czech men.",
            "Nevertheless, when sampled at the end of winter after periods of elevated air pollution, men from Teplice showed evidence of lower sperm motility (1994 samples) and poorer morphology (both years) when compared with men sampled after periods of lower air pollution (Teplice in the fall and Prachatice the late winter or fall).",
            "These observations provide preliminary evidence that periods of elevated air pollution may be associated with decrements in sperm quality.",
            "While fertility data for this group of young men are not available, low values for sperm motility and normal morphology have been associated with infertility (50)(51)(52)(53).",
            "Decreases in the percentage of motile sperm (a measure of sperm viability) were observed in the men sampled late winter 1994 but not late winter 1993 despite the fact that levels of air pollutants were higher in 1993.",
            "The apparent lack of an exposureresponse relationship for this measure could be due to differences in the dynamics of the exposure or, alternatively, to other factors not assessed in this study.",
            "Additional studies in which men are sampled at various times between exposure and sampling could further examine this association.",
            "We used CASA to evaluate the quality of sperm motion, and these results, albeit somewhat difficult to interpret, did not demonstrate any consistent negative associations between the quality of sperm motion and periods of high air pollution.",
            "However, positive associations were observed between VSL and LIN and season (winter).",
            "CASA has not been applied widely in field studies, in part because the logistics of recording the sample promptly (to avoid degradation of sperm motility over time) and controlling the temperature precisely (13) are challenging in the field setting.",
            "Despite careful attention to these details, the recording equipment failed on 1 study day, and CASA data for 10 samples were unfortunately lost.",
            "Furthermore, the difficulty of recording a sufficient number of motile sperm in samples with very low percentages of motile sperm is widely recognized (13).",
            "The extent to which missing CASA data could have biased the results is difficult to determine.",
            "Nevertheless, based on the data available in this study, the quality of sperm motion did not appear to be negatively impacted in any consistent manner after periods of elevated air pollution.",
            "Limited information is available suggesting seasonal variations in sperm velocity measures (33) and this topic merits further study.",
            "We found highly significant associations between exposure to periods of medium (1994) and high (1993) air pollution and poor sperm morphology in this study.",
            "For both sperm morphology and sperm head morphology, no association was observed with season alone, and the negative associations with periods of pollution in both years remained strong after controlling for potential confounding by season.",
            "This finding may be important for public health because in clinical studies, sperm morphology is a relatively good predictor of fertility status (53).",
            "The SCSA was included in this study to provide a measure of the genetic integrity of sperm.",
            "Periods of high air pollution encountered in winter 1993 were associated with increased percent sperm with abnormal chromatin structure (COMP\u03b1 t ).",
            "High COMP\u03b1 t (> 30) has been associated with infertility and spontaneous abortion (24) in clinical studies, but this measure has only recently been applied to epidemiology studies.",
            "One such study found an association between exposure to cigarette smoke (which, like air pollution, also contains genotoxic PAHs) and elevated COMP\u03b1 t (54).",
            "It may be relevant, therefore, that smoking was retained in the COMP\u03b1 t model in this report.",
            "In this regard, it is noteworthy that another measure of genetic integrity, namely sperm aneuploidy, was significantly elevated in a subset of the same Czech men exposed to periods of high air pollution (nonsmokers from the Teplice winter 1993 group) compared to men exposed to periods of low air pollution (nonsmokers from the Teplice summer 1993 group) (54).",
            "Interestingly, a subset of active smokers (1 pack/day, selected from the Teplice winter 1994 group) also exhibited sperm with elevated levels of aneuploidy compared to nonsmokers in the same group (56).",
            "Taken together, these intriguing observations suggest further consideration of the potential impact of air pollution and/or smoking on the genetic integrity of human sperm.",

            "Also the Abx effects on the microbiota replicate those shown by us in an earlier study (22).",
            "The crucial finding of the present study is that when the microbial abundance is drastically reduced by Abx, heme does not injure the surface epithelium and does not induce the carcinogenic changes in the crypts, mentioned above.",
            "The absence of carcinogenic changes is not due to the slightly lower levels of cytotoxicity and ROS in the HA-group, which can be explained by the higher luminal dilution factor because of the increased fecal wet weight.",
            "Recently, we reported that heme diets induce, in the colon lumen, covalent heme modification resulting in the very lipophilic and toxic CHF, which is solubilized in mixed micelles (11).",
            "Abx block the mucosal sensing of these cytotoxic micelles, as they prevent the heme-induced changes in epithelial histology and in up-regulation of injury markers such as Slpi.",
            "In contrast, Abx do not block mucosal sensing of luminal ROS, as the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response was initiated and PPARs were activated by oxidized lipids in both heme diet groups.",
            "This differential mucosal sensing shows that, with Abx, the mucus layer is still permeable to small molecules, such as oxidized lipids, but no longer to larger micellar aggregates containing CHF.",
            "The absence of hyperproliferation in the HAgroup also shows that mucosal exposure to ROS does not cause hyperproliferation.",
            "This result is in line with our previous observation that ROS is instantly formed after consumption of the heme diet, whereas there is a delay in the appearance of luminal cytotoxicity and the induction of hyperproliferation (11).",
            "Our study implies that the colon microbiota facilitates hemeinduced epithelial injury and hyperproliferation by opening the mucus barrier by the concerted action of hydrogen sulfide-producing and mucin-degrading bacteria.",
            "The principal steps of this hypothesis (Fig. 5) are (i) mucolysis by hydrogen sulfide to open the compact, protective mucus layer for (ii) further bacterial degradation, thereby (iii) allowing diffusion of luminal, cytotoxic micelles to the mucosal surface.",

            "Typical S-S breaking agents are N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, L-cysteine, and 2-mercaptoethanol, all known to decrease mucin viscosity in vivo and in vitro (16).",
            "Our DTNB results show that sulfide, compared with these thiols, is twofold more potent in breaking S-S bonds.",
            "The pK a of hydrogen sulfide is about 1 unit lower than that of the thiols, implying that the concentration of the nucleophilic agent (i.e., the anion) in the splitting of S-S is higher with hydrogen sulfide.",

            "Elaborating on Ellman's mechanism of S-S splitting (17), we reasoned that the highly nucleophlic persulfide, formed in the first reaction, generates a trisulfide bond in the second one.",

            "Moreover, this polymeric Muc2 dissociates almost completely after reduction by DTT or sulfide, supporting the hypothesis that S-S bond splitting by sulfide opens the mucus barrier.",
            "This hypothesis is supported further by the recent finding that increasing the number of S-S bonds in the Muc2 network increases the mucus barrier in mouse colon (25).",
            "Our mechanism of S-S bond splitting by sulfide is corroborated by a recent nutritional study by Devkota et al. (26), showing that monoassociation of germ-free mice with the sulfide-producing proteobacterium Bilophila wardsworthia, in the presence of taurocholate, results in breaking of the mucus barrier.",
            "The authors suggest that this is either due to sulfide (produced from taurine) or to unconjugated deoxycholate.",
            "However, the authors did not find barrier breaking in the presence of glycocholate, which is also metabolized to deoxycholate but does not generate sulfide.",

            "The DNA base excision repair pathway is the main system involved in the removal of oxidative damage to DNA such as 8-Oxoguanine (8-oxoG) primarily via the 8-Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1).",

            "In a group of 15 healthy volunteers, we found a daily variation of Ogg1 expression and activity with higher levels in the morning compared to the evening hours.",
            "Consistent with this, we also found lower levels of 8-oxoG in morning hours compared to those in the evening hours.",
            "Lymphocytes exposed to oxidative damage to DNA at 8:00 AM display lower accumulation of 8-oxoG than lymphocytes exposed at 8:00 PM.",
            "Furthermore, altered levels of Ogg1 expression were also observed in a group of shift workers experiencing a deregulation of circadian clock genes compared to a control group.",

            "We hypothesized that in the context of evolution, daily changes in oxidative stressors may have forced the system involved in DNA damage repair such as the BER pathway to evolve in a circadian fashion to ensure maximum protection during the active phase of the day (morning and afternoon) when there may be a higher probability of oxidative injury.",
            "The goal in undertaking this study was to find out whether 8-oxoG DNA damage repair displayed a circadian rhythm.",
            "Firstly, we tested this hypothesis on a group of 15 young healthy subjects.",
            "Consistent with previous studies, the concentration of melatonin peaked during night sleep while the level of cortisol peaked in the early morning concurrent with waking.",
            "However, among our subjects, peak melatonin occurred at 4:00 AM.",
            "This is later than the ~2:00 AM reported elsewhere in the literature, and may be a consequence of our light/dark (LD) cycle which used lights out at midnight.",
            "Our results are consistent with the results of Wright et al. in which subjects measured in their regular city environment showed melatonin midpoint of 4:00 AM whereas after a week without any electric light (camping) it shifted to 2:00 AM.",
            "Clock genes in lymphocytes showed expression patterns corroborated by the literature.",
            "Clock gene exhibited no circadian rhythmicity as previously observed by Bjarnason et al..",
            "Taken together, these data suggest that the subjects enrolled in this study were well synchronized along a 24\u2009h time scale.",
            "A daily rhythm for the BER system was inferred primarily by the oscillation of the OGG1 enzyme.",
            "The daily variation of OGG1 activity resulted from different levels of mRNA and protein expression.",
            "Nevertheless, there was an inter-subject variability in OGG1 activity: some subjects seemed to possess substantial OGG1 rhythmicity in their lymphocytes, while others possessed a less-pronounced OGG1 rhythm.",
            "However, no subject lacked transcription of the Ogg1 gene, and the time of individual peaks and troughs of OGG1 activity appeared to be essentially conserved in the subjects group.",
            "It must be stressed that although our results have shown a daily cycle of OGG1 activity consistent with circadian rhythmicity, they do not unequivocally reveal that this activity is endogenous because the subjects were maintained in the laboratory on a LD cycle (i.e., LD 16:8).",
            "Similarly, DNA damage repair showed daily variation in lymphocytes taken from these same volunteers.",
            "A constant routine protocol will be required for final demonstration of endogenous circadian rhythmicity.",
            "Human OGG1 activity in lymphocytes displayed about 50% variation along a 24\u2009h time period with the lowest value in the evening and the highest early in the morning, near the start of subject\u2019s active span.",
            "The physiological downregulation of OGG1 activity in the evening hours resulted in higher endogenous levels of 8-oxoG than those in the morning hours.",
            "Two previous studies of daily variation in DNA repair have used mouse brain, and mouse skin.",
            "Interestingly, the findings in each showed peak nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity in the evening, in contrast with our finding evidence of peak BER activity in the morning in humans.",
            "Another study examined antioxidant gene expression and GSH level in mouse liver, and found peak GSH in the morning, whereas mRNA levels of NRF2 pathway peaked in the afternoon.",
            "Our ex vivo results showed that lower OGG1 activity in the evening hours led to a slower repair capacity of oxidative damage than in the morning hours with higher 8-oxoG accumulation.",
            "The difference between the rate of repair in the morning and in the evening is significant only for FPG sensitive sites, consistent with the notion that a decrease in OGG1 levels has a more profound effect on the rates of repair of the poorly recognized 8-oxoG than the efficiently recognized SSBs, probably due to the presence of other enzymes (besides OGG1) capable of repairing SSBs.",
            "These results are summarized in Fig. 6.",
            "Interestingly, exposure to oxidative stress did not upregulate a transcriptional response of Ogg1 expression needed to face DNA damage even during evening times when the repair capacity is at its lowest levels.",
            "This evidence supports the hypothesis that Ogg1 expression is not modulated in response to a DNA damage, but it could follow a circadian variation exclusively regulated directly or indirectly by the endogenous biological clock.",
            "Our in vitro results showed that Ogg1 expression followed a circadian rhythmicity in phase with Per and Cry genes in line with the results obtained in vivo.",
            "In BMAL1-KO HuDe the loss of circadian rhythmicity of clock gene expression is paralleled by the loss of Ogg1 expression fluctuation, pointing out the dependence of Ogg1 modulation on a correct functioning of the molecular circadian clock.",
            "It was previously reported that BMAL1 deficiency affects cell survival both from hydrogen peroxide (higher sensitivity) and anti-cancer agents (lower sensitivity).",
            "BMAL1-KO fibroblasts also showed decreased DNA damage induced by DNA-damaging anticancer drugs.",
            "Our findings further implicate BMAL1 in the regulation of the BER pathway reflected in an association between the suppression of BMAL1 expression and an increase of OGG1 activity resulting in a higher rate of 8-oxoG repair in response to oxidative injury.",
            "Circadian gene KOs which obliterate circadian rhythmicity in mouse and cell models may be inherently different from the circadian disruption which occurs when an otherwise normal human is exposed to light at night.",
            "Individuals who work at night (such as shift workers) experience exposure to light and have altered sleep/wake cycles resulting in impaired physiological rhythms.",
            "However, the connection between internal circadian desynchronization (for example in shift workers) and cancer etiology remains unresolved and controversial.",
            "Altered clock gene expression was previously reported in shift workers.",
            "This alteration in the mRNA levels of clock genes may be potentially due to an epigenetic impact of shift work.",
            "In this study, we found that shift workers experiencing altered circadian clock showed an alteration of Ogg1 expression.",
            "The asynchronous manner of clock gene regulation in shift workers would not be directly responsible for malignant disease, but a lack of protection may allow toxic exposures to affect cells that are in a more vulnerable state.",
            "Our findings support that night workers should avoid any environmental and lifestyle agents potentially capable of generating any DNA damage such as cigarette smoking which was found to affect the oxidized DNA levels in the sperm.",
            "Our study shows some limitations to be taken in consideration.",
            "To avoid excessive blood sample collection, we studied selected genes of clock and BER system, focusing on the Ogg1 gene as limiting enzyme of BER system.",
            "As consequence we cannot rule out a circadian variation of other genes involved in BER pathway.",
            "However our findings led us to infer the daily rhythm for the BER system primarily by the oscillation of the OGG1 enzyme.",
            "Moreover we cannot know if differences of clock genes and Ogg1 gene expression found between shift and daytime workers in a single time point were due to variations in amplitude or phase shift of circadian gene expression, or if they persist in other time points in the 24\u2009h period.",
            "The limitation of the single time point of sampling is a common issue in studies aiming to investigate an expression of genes with a circadian variation.",
            "In conclusion, for the first time, the findings of this study provide evidence of a circadian regulation of the BER system mainly as a result of the oscillation of the OGG1 enzyme and suggest that people with a desynchronization of circadian rhythms (i.e. shift workers) may experience an alteration of oxidative DNA damage repair.",
            "This may also occur to some extent in all persons in the modern world who use electricity to light the night.",
            "Methods",
            "The study was approached in three ways.",
            "First, we examined circadian variation in 8-oxoG repair in lymphocytes of 15 healthy volunteers over a 24\u2009hour period.",
            "Second, from a previous study, we measured the expression of Ogg1 in lymphocytes of 60 rotating shift workers and 54 daytime workers from a blood sample taken in the morning for all workers after a day off.",
            "Finally, we then used human fibroblasts in vitro to test the influence of BMAL1 in circadian cycling of Ogg1 expression and in repair of 8-oxoG induced by oxidative damage to DNA.",

        "paper_as_candidate_pool": [
            "Background",
            "Worldwide used pesticides containing different adjuvants like Roundup formulations, which are glyphosate-based herbicides, can provoke some in vivo toxicity and in human cells.",
            "These pesticides are commonly found in the environment, surface waters and as food residues of Roundup tolerant genetically modified plants.",
            "In order to know their effects on cells from liver, a major detoxification organ, we have studied their mechanism of action and possible protection by precise medicinal plant extracts called Dig1.",
            "Methods",
            "The cytotoxicity pathways of four formulations of glyphosate-based herbicides were studied using human hepatic cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B, known models to study xenobiotic effects.",
            "We monitored mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity and caspases 3/7 for cell mortality and protection by Dig1, as well as cytochromes P450 1A1, 1A2, 3A4 and 2C9 and glutathione-S-transferase to approach the mechanism of actions.",
            "Results",
            "All the four Roundup formulations provoke liver cell death, with adjuvants having stronger effects than glyphosate alone.",
            "Hep3B are 3-5 times more sensitive over 48 h.",
            "Caspases 3/7 are greatly activated in HepG2 by Roundup at non-cytotoxic levels, and some apoptosis induction by Roundup is possible together with necrosis.",
            "CYP3A4 is specifically enhanced by Roundup at doses 400 times less than used in agriculture (2%).",
            "CYP1A2 is increased to a lesser extent together with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) down-regulation.",
            "Dig 1, non cytotoxic and not inducing caspases by itself, is able to prevent Roundup-induced cell death in a time-dependant manner with an important efficiency of up to 89%, within 48 h.",
            "In addition, we evidenced that it prevents Caspases 3/7 activation and CYP3A4 enhancement, and not GST reduction, but in turn it slightly inhibited CYP2C9 when added before Roundup.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Roundup is able to provoke intracellular disruption in hepatic cell lines at different levels, but a mixture of medicinal plant extracts Dig1 can protect to some extent human cell lines against this pollutants.",
            "All this system constitutes a tool for studying liver intoxication and detoxification.",
            "Background",
            "Roundup (R) is the most widely used non-selective herbicide worldwide.",
            "It is comprised of a mixture of an isopropylamine salt of glyphosate (G) and adjuvants.",
            "G is considered as the active ingredient of R, although quantitatively it is a minor constituent, which is not supposed to be toxic alone in mammals.",
            "Various adjuvants are present in R as secret of formulations, amplifying and thus allowing the G herbicide action, as well as its unintended toxic and endocrine disrupting effects in human placental cells.",
            "The adjuvants, which are chosen from a long list that can vary from formulation to formulation, stabilize and help G penetration into cells.",
            "Among these are benzisothiazolone, isobutene, light aromatic petroleum distillate, methyl pyrrolidinone, polyethoxylated tallowamine or alkylamine (POEA), etc.",
            "Some of these compounds may be genotoxic or form adducts with DNA.",
            "It is thus important to compare different R formulations when studying this herbicide's toxicity.",
            "Moreover R residues are quite stable in rivers and soils.",
            "G and its metabolite AMPA (aminomethyl phosphonic acid) are among the primary pollutants of surface waters (IFEN, 2006); they also enter the food chain.",
            "These chemicals are found in the urine of agricultural workers.",
            "The use of this herbicide is increasing as more than 75% of genetically modified edible plants have been designed to be used in conjunction with R.",
            "These plants are engineered to tolerate high intracellular levels of R.",
            "We have also shown that the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line was even more sensitive to R, this was dose- and time-dependent; and thus it was hypothesized that this could explain pregnancy outcomes and miscarriages reported for agricultural workers using G-based herbicides.",
            "This is consistent with the fact that G-based herbicides have recently been shown to be endocrine disruptors in cell lines.",
            "We know that xenobiotics have a main endpoint in the liver, which is the major detoxification organ.",
            "Here, we investigated the mechanism of action of R in the human liver cell lines available, HepG2 and Hep3B, which have been used as a model system to study xenobiotic toxicity, most prominently HepG2.",
            "We wanted to compare in the first instance the actions of four R formulations on both cell lines and then to detail the enzymatic pathways activated in HepG2.",
            "Detoxifying mechanisms are frequently enhanced by plant extracts, which can provide additional protection against radicals and electrophilic compounds.",
            "We have tested the ability of a new drug described for the first time, Dig1 (D), to protect cells from R intoxication.",
            "D contains plant extracts from Taraxacum officinalis, Arctium lappa and Berberis vulgaris.",
            "These herbal preparations were chosen in particular for their digestive detoxification or hepato-protective effects.",
            "It was thus interesting to compare these general findings on plant extracts to some biochemically precise markers that could be modified in human hepatocytes, such as caspases 3/7, cytochromes P450, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SD), in order to detail the pathway(s) of action(s) of these mixtures used as medicinal plants in vivo, and thus to explore their cellular protective potential.",
            "Methods",
            "1. Chemicals",
            "Four main R formulations which have been used in agriculture (Monsanto, Anvers, Belgium) have been chosen in this study: Express\u00ae 7.2 g/l of G called glyphosate or N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine, product number 2010321; Bioforce\u00ae 360 g/l of G, product number 9800036; GT\u00ae 400 g/l of G, product number 8800425; GT+\u00ae 450 g/l of G, product number 2020448.",
            "The various herbicide formulations were prepared in Eagle's modified minimum essential medium (EMEM; Abcys, Paris, France), with 10% calf fetal serum from Cambrex (Verviers, Belgium) otherwise specified.",
            "G was from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France), its called \"2% solution\" was equivalent in concentration to 2% R Bioforce\u00ae and was prepared in serum free-medium, and adjusted to pH 5.8 of 2% R. D is a mixture of diluted plant extracts obtained by Sevene Pharma (Monoblet, France) from original independent macerates corresponding to 1/10 of dried plants in a water-alcohool solution of 45 to 55%.",
            "They are afterwards diluted in 70% alcohol with Taraxacum officinalis macerate at 10-4, Arctium lappa at 10-4 and Berberis vulgaris at 10-5.",
            "D is prepared in the medium at 2% of the mixture in positive controls.",
            "The 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and all other compounds, unless otherwise specified, were from Sigma-Aldrich.",
            "The MTT stock solution at 5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline was diluted 10-fold in serum-free EMEM and then filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter.",
            "2. Cell cultures, Roundup and/or Dig1 exposures",
            "The hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B were provided by ECACC, numbers 85011430 and 86062703, respectively.",
            "They are from Caucasian and Negroid hepatoma origins (from 15- and 8-year-old children respectively).",
            "Cells were grown in flasks of 75 cm2 surface from Dutscher (Brumath, France) in phenol red-free EMEM containing 2 mM glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acid, 100 U/ml of antibiotics (mix of penicillin, streptomycin) and 10% fetal calf serum.",
            "For treatments, 50,000 cells were plated per well and grown at 37\u00b0C (5% C02, 95% air) during a period of 48 h to 80% confluence in 48-well plates (except in Figure 1, 24-well plates were used).",
            "The cells were then exposed (24-72 h) to various concentrations of tested chemicals, which were replaced every 24 h for D studies.",
            "D was at 2%.",
            "For cytochromes and GST studies, before S9 fractions preparations, cells were treated in 25 ml and in 175 cm2 flasks at 80% confluence.",
            "In this case after 24 h, another 25 ml was added as the second treatment.",
            "In all cases, medium M was used as control and R was present at the LC50, which was 25 ppm for R400 in these conditions, far below doses recommended in agriculture (1-2%, i.e. 10,000-20,000 ppm).",
            "3. S9 fractions",
            "The medium was removed, and cells dislodged by treatment with 7 ml of trypsin-EDTA (Lonza, France) and washed (PBS, Eurobio, France) twice by centrifugations (70 g, 5 min), at room temperature.",
            "Cells were then resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5 with 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM DTT, homogenized and centrifuged at 9,000 g, 4\u00b0C for 30 min.",
            "The supernatants corresponding to the S9 fractions (membrane and cytosolic enzymes) were collected and frozen at -80\u00b0C until further evaluation for enzyme activities.",
            "Protein concentration was determined in each S9 fraction according to the Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay (Sigma, France).",
            "4. Cell death measurement",
            "The enzymatic MTT test is based on the cleavage of MTT into blue formazan by the mitochondrial enzyme succinate-dehydrogenase, it was used to evaluate human cell viability as described in our group.",
            "The optical density was measured using a luminometer (Mithras LB 940, Berthold, France) at 570 nm.",
            "The crude protective actions were evaluated at the end of the treatment, by comparing the toxicity of R after treatment by D or not.",
            "As R toxicity is induced at the chosen LC50, the relative efficiency of the protective effect (recovering) is the percentage of recovered viability in the presence of D in comparison to the maximal toxic effect at LC50.",
            "5. Caspase 3/7 activity measurement",
            "The Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 assay (Promega, Paris, France) in 96-well white plates (Dutscher, France) was a luminescent method designed for automated high-throughput screening of caspases activity, which is a measure of apoptosis.",
            "This method can measure caspase-3 and -7 activities in purified enzyme preparations or cultures of adherent or suspended cells.",
            "The assay provides a pro-luminescent caspase-3/7 substrate, which contains the tetrapeptide sequence DEVD.",
            "This substrate is cleaved to release amino-luciferin, a substrate for luciferase, and the production of light is proportional to the quantity of amino-luciferin released and therefore proportional to caspase.",
            "The Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 reagent has been optimized for caspase activity, luciferase activity and cell lysis.",
            "The addition of the single Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 reagent, in an \"add-mix-measure\" format, results in cell lysis followed by caspase cleavage of the substrate and generation of a \"glow-type\" luminescent signal.",
            "After cell cultures were exposed to 50 \u03bcL of various dilutions, an equal volume of Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 reagent was added to each well.",
            "Plates were then agitated 15 min and incubated 45 min at room temperature in the dark, to stabilize the signal before measuring luminescence.",
            "The negative control was the serum-free medium, the positive control was the active Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 reagent mixed with cells treated only with serum-free medium to determine the basal activity of the caspases 3/7.",
            "Luminescence was measured using the luminometer Mithras LB 940 (Berthold, Thoiry, France) at 565 nm.",
            "6. Cytochrome P450 activity measurement",
            "The cytochrome P450 3A4, 2C9, 1A2 and 1A1 activities were quantified by the P450 Glo\u2122 Assays (Promega, France), as described by Yueh et al..",
            "Each Cytochrome P450/1 M KPO4/Substrate Reaction mixture containing the S9 fractions (duplicate) was pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min in white 96-well plates (Dutscher, France).",
            "The Cytochrome P450 CYP1A1 Reaction mixture contained 135 \u03bcg of the human liver S9 fraction as control (Tebu-Bio, France) or cell S9 fraction with 60 \u03bcM luciferin-conjugated substrate (luciferin-6'-chloroethyl ether) and 200 mM KPO4 buffer in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl.",

            "Results",
            "Figure 1 presents the different time-dependent effects of various R formulations at 0.5% on viability of liver cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B.",
            "The R formulations contained different concentrations of both G and various adjuvants.",
            "Both cell lines showed approximately similar growth rates for around 32 h in control medium (M).",
            "In both cell lines, growth rate was easily disrupted by any R formulation, but different R formulations had different effects.",
            "In the case of R7.2 and R360, Hep3B cells were approximately 3-5 times more sensitive than HepG2 over 48 h.",
            "However, in the case of R400 and R450 at 0.5% the two cell lines were roughly equal in sensitivity.",
            "These two R formulations were found to be most rapid-acting and toxic.",
            "Based on this observation these were chosen for use in subsequent experiments.",
            "Cell death was estimated by inhibition of succinate-dehydrogenase and thus of mitochondrial metabolism.",
            "In both cell lines, mortality increases with G concentrations and time of exposure to all 4 R formulations, however the increase is not proportional to G concentration (insert Figure 2).",
            "The first two formulations demonstrate similar toxicities despite having quite different concentrations of G (7.2 and 360 g/l of G, respectively), along with adjuvants; the two other formulations show higher toxicity as previously explained.",
            "This dose-dependent effect is clearly illustrated in Figure 2 with the two groups of decreasing curves with the two families of R (R400 and R450 on one side, first toxic family, and R7.2 and R360 on the other).",
            "It also becomes obvious that G has no toxic action alone under the conditions used in this study (empty squares, Figure 2).",
            "We identified the LC50 of R400 (GT\u00ae) in 24 h in 48-well plates as being 40 ppm for Hep3B and 96 ppm for HepG2.",
            "No difference was seen between HepG2 and Hep3B cells in their sensitivity to R400 when exposed at relatively high concentrations in Figure 1.",
            "Titrations to determine the LC50 of R400 revealed clearly that Hep3B cells were more sensitive to R400 than were HepG2.",
            "We then tested the impact of 2% D at these conditions of R intoxication (Figure 3).",
            "We confirmed R400 toxicity to hepatocyte-derived cell lines exposed at the LC50 for 24 h, and found that D was able to prevent this toxicity.",
            "First, we demonstrated that D alone was not toxic, at 2% for as long as 72 h, nor was it able to inhibit mitochondrial metabolism (data not shown).",
            "Then we observed that pre-treatment with D (in comparison to control M) had a time-amplified protective effect from the most toxic R. After 24 h of D exposure and 24 h of R, the efficiency of protective action of D reached 43% for Hep3B, and 55% for HepG2.",
            "After 48 h of D and 24 h of R, the efficiency of D reached 62% and 89% respectively.",
            "These effects were proportional to time (compare curve DRM to RMM).",
            "No curative effect (positive D action after R) was observed under these conditions with these cells since post-treatment with D did not influence R toxicity (curves are superimposed with RMM, see Figure 3, legend).",
            "The mechanism was studied in more detail in HepG2 where the enzymes are better characterized and assessed.",
            "First, we evaluated the time-course for onset of the preventive effect of D, by incubating cells with D and removing it before R addition (Figure 4).",
            "We show that the efficiency of protection of D is established (53% in this case) at 24 h, but can be observed as early as 6 h after adding D to cells.",
            "At this time, protection from the toxicity of R was significant.",
            "We then investigated what might be the metabolic target of the protective effect of D. Caspases 3/7 are shown in Figure 5 to be activated up to 156% by 24 h exposure to R and up to 765% by 48 h exposure (comparison was to the control M at 24 h and MM at 48 h).",
            "After 24 h of exposure, if R is replaced by M, the caspases recover in 24 h to their initial activity.",
            "Figure 5 shows that D does not induce caspases itself, but appears to prevent induction of caspases by R (DR).",
            "Considering caspases activities as an early sign of apoptosis, these results confirm lack of D toxicity and the ability of D to protect from R toxicity.",
            "In addition to caspases, we examined the effects of R on cytochromes, finding that R does not activate all cytochromes but is able to enhance more specifically CYP3A4 (to 240-360%) and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 (to 130-170%, Figure 6).",
            "D does not enhance these cytochromes by itself (RD versus RM, Figure 6); but it weakly increases CYP2C9 in combination with R (to 140%), when added after it, even though this is not statistically different from RM treatment (but from control M alone).",
            "Once again, based on this additional parameter, D confirmed its ability to block R toxicity: if D is applied before R no cytochrome activity was stimulated, CYP2C9 was even weakly inhibited (40%).",
            "By contrast, in Figure 7, it is shown that R inhibits GST almost by half, and D does not modify this effect either before or after R treatment.",
            "Figure 8 summarizes the results obtained on the different pathways of R and D actions on HepG2.",
            "Discussion",
            "This work evidences for the first time the effects of several formulations of the major herbicide worldwide (R) on human hepatic cell lines available, which are widely recognized as models to study xenobiotic actions.",
            "We tested R at sub-agricultural levels; the LC50 measured in this work is 10 times for Hep3B and 4 times for HepG2 below the maximum level of residues authorized in some feed (400 ppm,).",
            "We found that the cell sensitivity depended on the nature of the R formulation.",
            "Both cell lines have retained the activities of the drug metabolism phase I and phase II enzymes involved in activation and detoxification of genotoxic carcinogens.",
            "HepG2 cells are in general considered a better model since they have three-fold higher levels of CYP1A1 and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) than Hep3B.",
            "For instance, it was observed that HepG2 are more sensitive than Hep3B to cisplatin, to dietary genotoxins and to genotoxicants.",
            "In our hands it was the opposite for R, overall in 48 h.",
            "In fact, both cell lines are from different genetic origins, from different boys at different ages, and thus have specific enzymatic equipments including cytochromes P450.",
            "Greater sensitivity was observed with Hep3B.",
            "It was thus important to obtain results in both lines that confirmed R toxicity in all human models tested up to now, including embryonic 293 cells, umbilical cord cells, placental derived JEG3 cells and microsomes from fresh placenta.",
            "It was evidenced that cell death increased with time of exposure for all R formulations, this phenomenon shows that the threshold of toxicity depends not only on the dose but also on time, as previously clearly demonstrated on embryonic and placental cells.",
            "It was also shown that toxicity was dependent on the nature of the adjuvants present in different R formulations.",
            "Moreover, the action of serum only temporarily buffered R toxicity.",
            "We found that serum-free culture medium revealed essentially the same xenobiotic impacts that are visible 1-2 days later in serum.",
            "Thus, although the timecourse of action is delayed, the pathways of actions appear similar.",
            "Indeed, the G cytotoxic effects do not vary linearly with dose; this demonstrates the differential roles of adjuvants in the amplification of toxicity, since G has no toxicity alone at these concentrations.",
            "The adjuvants added to G in various R formulations are considered manufacturing secrets, but obviously do not form an inert part of the composition.",
            "One mechanism of adjuvant action is most probably to form detergent vesicles that allow cell membrane opening and penetration of G, and that most probably facilitate bioaccumulation of G, metabolites and adjuvants, and gene disruptive effects, which could explain time-amplified effects.",
            "A very small quantity of adjuvants combined with G has been already demonstrated to have similar effects to R.",
            "It is a recognized fact that mixtures of xenobiotics have synergistic effects.",
            "We observed that whatever the nature of the various adjuvants is in the 4 R formulations, the mechanism of toxicity is similar on several crucial endpoints: namely SD, AK, Caspases 3/7.",
            "Only the threshold of toxicity is different.",
            "In this study, we sought to understand the mechanism of toxicity of the two R formulations that have the most rapid toxic effects on hepatic cells.",
            "We also evaluated whether it was possible to prevent R toxicity by D. D is a newly described product comprised of a mixture of extracts from Taraxacum officinalis, Arctium lappa and Berberis vulgaris.",
            "Taraxacum was cited for protective effects in the digestive system, also anti-tumoral and anti-oxydant effects.",
            "Arctium lappa is also found to be hepato-protective, as well as Berberis .",
            "First of all, the lack of D impact on cell viability in comparison to controls indicates that it is not cytotoxic at 2%.",
            "It was hypothesized first that either D does not penetrate cells without embedding cell-cell interactions, or it is relatively inert on several important markers of cell function at this concentration.",
            "Our results are consistent with D penetrating the cells and not just forming a shield that prevents R from penetrating.",
            "This is verified since effective protection by D necessitates more than 6 h of contact, and because D modifies enzymatic activities, as detailed below.",
            "As a matter of fact, D shows a clear and very strong efficiency of protective action against the toxicity of R in both hepatic cell lines; protection is up to 89% for HepG2 in 48 h.",
            "It is not completely excluded that this important action of D can occur by preventing entrance of R into cells, normally helped by adjuvants.",
            "However D clearly has intracellular actions, including prevention of caspases 3/7 activation and CYP3A4 enhancement, both provoked by R. CYP 3A4 was induced by Roundup in comparative manner and in similar time than with other xenobiotics Bisphenol A, DDT and phtalates, respectively.",
            "Other metabolic/biochemical effects of D components have also been reported, for instance, the protective effects on acute pancreatitis in rats through IL-6 reduction, as well as the suppression of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and lipid oxidation.",
            "Polyphenolic compounds present in D are considered hepatoprotective but the time-dependent protective effects on the crucial mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase and caspases 3 and 7 had not been demonstrated before.",
            "Since HepG2 are more resistant and D more preventive on this line, we decided to detail the signalling pathway of R and D actions in these cells.",
            "Moreover, the caspases, cytochromes and GST activities are more fully documented in this hepatic cell line.",
            "The measurement of caspase 3/7 activity has been recognized as a marker for apoptosis in HepG2 cells.",
            "Caspases 3/7 have been rarely measured in HepG2, and found to be induced 200% by 30 \u03bcM Tamoxifen in 24 h.",
            "Their induction by R in our study (156% in 24 h and 765% in 48 h) confirms the proposed apoptotic mechanism activated by R.",
            "Of course, this does not exclude some necrosis as a primary mode of cell death as we previously showed.",
            "Our results also show that D alone does not interfere with caspases but may possibly prevent R impact on these enzymes.",
            "At lower levels and even with the buffering effect of serum already documented, D also prevents CYP3A4 induction: CYP3A4 is by far the major target of R among the phase I activating enzymes measured.",
            "CYP3A4 is the most abundant P450 expressed (60%) in human liver.",
            "It is involved in the bioactivation of environmental procarcinogens, such as aflatoxin B1 and benzo[a]pyrene among a number of others.",
            "Some organochlorine pesticides can activate the PXR, a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates CYP3A4 gene transcription in particular in liver.",
            "R components may also induce this process.",
            "The results with CYP1A2 (slight induction by R) show that its action does not depend on a unique pathway, like the results on CYP2C9.",
            "Only a few reports are available on CYP2C9, which is inhibited by extracts of other plants such as pineapple.",
            "Similarly, only some xenobiotics such as polychlorobyphenyls inhibit GST; this is typical of estrogen-like effects already observed with R on aromatase.",
            "The disruption of xenobiotic metabolism by R in our study, which increased some cytochromes P450 and decreased GST, may alter liver detoxification function, leading to the accumulation of toxic reactive oxydated molecules in a manner that could be prevented by D in this study.",
            "In fact, GST inhibition, if R intoxication continues, could lead to the accumulation of reactive compounds, due to disruption of xenobiotic excretion.",
            "In conclusion, it is demonstrated and explained that high hepatic cell line mortality is provoked by R, at doses far below those used in agriculture.",
            "The mechanism of action on various essential enzymes is detailed in Figure 8.",
            "This impact on cell death was observed at doses far smaller than legally allowed residues of G in GM food or feed (400 ppm,), in our study LC50 was in comparison 40 to 96 ppm.",
            "Of course G can be metabolized and excreted out of the body but this has to be balanced in regard to its cell penetration and bioaccumulation due to adjuvants.",
            "In these conditions, this can be almost totally prevented in HepG2 in 48 h by a specific drug, D, that mostly prevents caspases 3/7 activation and CYP3A4 enhancement, both provoked by R. However it does not prevent GST inhibition by R that could lead to accumulation of toxic reactive compounds.",
            "Since the use of cell lines allows longer experiments, and since cell lines may in some instances be less sensitive to xenobiotics than primary cultures, this system with R and Dig1 constitutes an interesting tool for studying liver intoxication and detoxification.",
            "The activity of Dig1 should be now also tested in vivo in animal experiments."

            "The fractions of progeny derived from the modified strand were 24 and 23% for CTag/pIRES and CTag/pIRES-mXPV, respectively, without mitomycin pretreatment, and 27 and 22% for CTag/pIRES and CTag/pIRES-mXPV, respectively, with pretreatment, showing no significant differences between these two cell lines.",
            "Subsequently, another XPV cell line, XP30RO(sv), was used to confirm the result with CTag; a very low miscoding frequency was also noted in this cell line (Table I).",
            "Taken together, our results indicate the following.",
            "(i) Pol \u03b7 does not play a major role in translesion synthesis across \u03b1-OH-PdG. (ii) Pol \u03b7 is not critical to error-free bypass.",
            "(iii) Pol \u03b7 is primarily responsible for inaccurate translesion synthesis (\u03b1-OH-PdG\u2192T).",
            "The latter two ideas are supported by the results ofin vitro experiments (Fig. 7, A andB).",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "Acrolein is a bifunctional agent that reacts with the 1 andN\n2 positions of dG to form two exocyclic propano adducts.",
            "The exocyclic rings are formed in the region involved in Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding to dC.",
            "Both adducts inhibit DNA synthesis, and \u03b1-OH-PdG miscodes in human XPA cells (34).",
            "To investigate the cellular translesion synthesis mechanism for \u03b1-OH-PdG, we conducted experiments in vitro with purified eukaryotic DNA polymerases and compared the results with the previousin vivo data to deduce a likely in vivomechanism.",
            "The Role of Pol \u03b7 in Inaccurate Synthesis in Human Cells",
            "We showed that pol \u03b7 bypassed \u03b1-OH-PdG (Fig. 6), incorporated dAMP but not dCMP opposite this adduct (Fig. 7\nA), and extended the primer efficiently from this dA terminus (Fig. 7\nB).",
            "These results suggest that pol \u03b7-catalyzed synthesis can be highly inaccurate, resulting in \u03b1-OH-PdG\u2192T transversions and that pol \u03b7 does not contribute to error-free translesion synthesis.",
            "The miscoding frequencies obtained in the two XPV cell lines (Table I) were significantly lower than those obtained in XPA cells (34), and the lowered frequencies were complemented, though not perfectly, by the introduction of mXPV (Table I).",
            "The mXPV did not affect translesion synthesis efficiency.",
            "These results indicate that pol \u03b7 plays a minor role in the overall process of translesion synthesis but is largely responsible for the inaccurate synthesis.",
            "The involvement of pol \u03b7 in inaccurate replication was also reported recently for \u03b3-OH-PdG (57).",
            "In S. cerevisiae, pol \u03b7 has been shown to be responsible for the accurate synthesis past 8-oxo dG (58), the inaccurate synthesis past (6-4) thymine-thymine dimers (59), and both accurate and inaccurate syntheses past acetylaminofluorene dG adducts (59).",
            "The Role of Other Translesion Polymerases in Inaccurate Synthesis in Human Cells",
            "We observed miscoding events in XPV (CTag) cells, though at reduced frequencies, suggesting that another polymerase(s) catalyzes inaccurate translesion synthesis in the absence of pol \u03b7.",
            "Among the polymerases examined, we found that pol \u03ba and pol \u03b9 incorporate incorrect nucleotides opposite \u03b1-OH-PdG (Fig.7\nA); pol \u03ba bypassed this adduct (Fig. 6) and extended from the dA, dG, and dT termini (Fig. 7\nB); and pol \u03b9 inserted dCMP and dTMP opposite \u03b1-OH-PdG (Fig. 7\nA), but no further extension was observed from these termini (Fig. 7\nB).",
            "This extension may be catalyzed by pol \u03b6 (Fig. 7\nB), as has been observed in vitro for abasic sites (53, 55, 56) and (6-4) thymine-thymine dimers (19, 54, 55).",
            "What Mechanism Operates in Error-free Translesion Synthesis?",
            "The experiments confirm and extend our previous work (34), demonstrating that accurate translesion synthesis of \u03b1-OH-PdG is the major event in human cells, accounting for \u223c90% of the products.",
            "It appears unlikely that pol \u03b7 or pol \u03ba contribute to a substantial degree for the following reasons.",
            "(i) Neither polymerase inserted correct dCMP opposite \u03b1-OH-PdG (Fig. 7\nA), and neither catalyzed extension from a dC terminus opposite this adduct (Fig. 7\nB).",
            "(ii) XPV cells conducted error-free translesion synthesis (Table I) with a substantial level of translesion synthesis. (iii)",
            "The introduction of mXPV did not enhance the level of translesion synthesis.",
            "In contrast to pol \u03b7 and pol \u03ba, pol \u03b9 and REV1 incorporated dCMP relatively efficiently opposite \u03b1-OH-PdG (Fig.7\nA), but extension from this dC terminus was not observed with either polymerase.",
            "Extension may be catalyzed by other polymerases such as pol \u03b6 and pol \u03ba, as has been observed for (6-4) thymine-thymine dimers (19, 54, 55) and abasic sites (53, 55, 56).",
            "Pol \u03b6, however, catalyzed limited extension from a dC terminus opposite \u03b1-OH-PdG as compared with that from the other three termini (Fig.7\nB).",
            "We did not observe any fully extended products by the simultaneous addition of REV1, which exclusively inserted dCMP, and pol \u03b6 to a reaction mixture.",
            "Thus, the 3\u2032-terminal dC paired to \u03b1-OH-PdG was very resistant to extension by pol \u03b6 as well as by pol \u03ba.",
            "It is likely, then, that pol \u03b6 is not involved in the accurate synthesis, but rather may play a role in inaccurate synthesis.",
            "With all the translesion polymerases examined, extension from purine (dA and dG) termini appears to be more efficient than it is from pyrimidine (dT and dC) termini, and a dC terminus is most resistant to such extension (Fig. 7\nB).",
            "In conclusion, pol \u03b9 and REV1 can serve to insert dCMP, but a polymerase that can catalyze a \u22657 nucleotide extension is required to propose a two polymerase-catalyzed bypass mechanism (19-23).",
            "Thus, the mechanism for this error-free synthesis is currently unknown.",
            "Pol \u03b4 is possibly responsible for the accurate synthesis, though itsin vitro bypass ability does not seem sufficient to account for the in vivo bypass synthesis.",
            "Another possibility is that other DNA polymerases, such as pol \u03b8 (60), pol \u03bb (60), and pol \u03bc (60) catalyze this accurate translesion synthesis in cells.",
            "For example, our preliminary experiments have shown that pol \u03b2, unlike translesion polymerases, extends a primer efficiently from a dC terminus (data not shown).",
            "We should also consider, however, that the current in vitro system lacks critical accessory factors that mediate the activity of these polymerases.",
            "In conclusion, our results indicate that multiple DNA polymerases are involved in the translesion synthesis across \u03b1-OH-PdG and that accurate and inaccurate translesion syntheses are catalyzed by different polymerases.",

            "Objectives: We studied the association of exposure to NO2, PM2.5, and traffic indicators on cause-specific mortality to evaluate the form of the concentration\u2013response relationship.",
            "Methods: We analyzed a population-based cohort enrolled at the 2001 Italian census with 9 years of follow-up.",
            "We selected all 1,265,058 subjects \u2265 30 years of age who had been living in Rome for at least 5 years at baseline.",
            "Residential exposures included annual NO2 (from a land use regression model) and annual PM2.5 (from a Eulerian dispersion model), as well as distance to roads with > 10,000 vehicles/day and traffic intensity.",
            "We used Cox regression models to estimate associations with cause-specific mortality adjusted for individual (sex, age, place of birth, residential history, marital status, education, occupation) and area (socioeconomic status, clustering) characteristics.",
            "Results: Long-term exposures to both NO2 and PM2.5 were associated with an increase in nonaccidental mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.03) per 10-\u00b5g/m3 NO2; HR = 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.05) per 10-\u00b5g/m3 PM2.5].",
            "The strongest association was found for ischemic heart diseases (IHD) [HR = 1.10 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.13) per 10-\u00b5g/m3 PM2.5], followed by cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer.",
            "The only association showing some deviation from linearity was that between NO2 and IHD.",
            "In a bi-pollutant model, the estimated effect of NO2 on mortality was independent of PM2.5.",
            "Conclusions: This large study strongly supports an effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 on mortality, especially from cardiovascular causes.",
            "The results are relevant for the next European policy decisions regarding air quality.",
            "Most of the available evidence linking long-term air pollution exposure with mortality comes from North American studies and is based on exposure contrasts between and within various communities.",
            "There are only a few European studies on the effects of long-term exposure to both fine particles (diameter \u2264 2.5 \u00b5m; PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on all-cause and cause-specific mortality.",
            "The estimated effects of long-term exposure to air pollution seem to be stronger for cardiovascular, respiratory, and lung-cancer mortality than for other causes of mortality, but the specific roles of PM2.5 and NO2, which both originate in urban areas (at least partially) from traffic and chemical transformation processes, have not been elucidated.",
            "Therefore, a recent review of the literature conducted by the Health Effects Institute (HEI) states that the evidence linking traffic air pollution and mortality is suggestive but not yet sufficient.",
            "In 2013, the European Union (EU) will revise its main air pollution control policies (the EU air pollution directive 2008/50/EC).",
            "Hence, the European Commission has recently requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) respond to several scientific open questions [the REVIHAAP project, Evidence on Health Aspects of Air Pollution to Review EU Policies (WHO 2013)].",
            "In particular, there is a need to better evaluate the form of the concentration\u2013response functions of PM2.5, to assess the independent role of NO2 on PM2.5, and to establish the outcomes to be considered in health impact assessment studies.",
            "The identification of population subgroups that may be particularly vulnerable to air pollution effects is an additional research concern.",
            "Some studies have suggested that sex, socioeconomic position, smoking, and health characteristics, which are usually treated as confounders, could modify exposure\u2013mortality associations.",
            "For example, reported that coronary deaths were associated with increasing levels of PM2.5 in women but not men.",
            "Therefore, it has been suggested that the next generation of studies should identify the characteristics of subjects who are most susceptible to the effects of air pollution.",
            "In the present study, we analyzed associations of NO2, PM2.5, and two GIS (geographic information system) indicators of traffic exposure (distance to heavy traffic roads with > 10,000 vehicles per day, and traffic intensity in a 150 m buffer) with cause-specific mortality in adults included in the Rome Longitudinal Study (RoLS).",
            "We estimated the overall effect of each single pollutant and traffic indicator on mortality and examined the form of the concentration\u2013response relationships.",

            "The RoLS is based on the 2001 census fixed cohort of Rome ascertained from the Municipal Register.",
            "We included all residents \u2265 30 years of age on the census reference day (21 October 2001) who were not living in institutions (prisons, hospitals, or nursing homes) and who had resided in Rome for at least 5 years.",
            "Data were available on sex, age, place of birth and residential history and were obtained for additional variables (marital status, education, occupation) using record-linkage procedures under strict control to protect individual privacy.",
            "We conducted a follow-up to determine vital status using the Rome Municipal Register during the period October 2001\u2013December 2010.",
            "We retrieved information on deceased individuals and considered subjects as lost to follow-up when they moved out of the city.",
            "The underlying cause of death [coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9; WHO 1977)] for deceased subjects was retrieved from the Lazio regional health information system.",

            "We assigned to each sampling location a single NO2 level, the mean of the three measurements.",

            "The best-fitting regression model had a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.704.",
            "The model was validated using leave-one-out cross validation; the R2, adjusted R2, and root mean square error of the regression analysis between measured and estimated concentrations was 0.61, 0.61, and 5.38, respectively.",
            "Residential exposure to PM2.5 was estimated using a 1 km\u2013grid dispersion model [the flexible air quality regional model (FARM), a three-dimensional Eulerian model of the transport and multiphase chemistry of pollutants in the atmosphere ].",
            "[For further details on the dispersion model, its validation, and the comparison of the results from the NO2 and PM2.5 models with actual measurements are provided in Supplemental Material, pp. 2\u20133 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1205862).]",

            "The first was the distance to high traffic roads (HTRs; roads with > 10,000 vehicles per day, which we categorized as < 50, 50\u2013100, 100\u2013150, 150\u2013250, and \u2265 250 m).",
            "The second was traffic intensity within the 150 m buffer zone around the home (the sum of the number of vehicles per day multiplied by the length of the roads in meters within the buffer) categorized in quintiles of the distribution.",
            "The size of the buffer was slightly larger than that used by.",

            "We analyzed mortality for nonaccidental causes (ICD-9 codes < 800), cardiovascular disease (ICD-9: 390\u2013459), ischemic heart disease [IHD (ICD-9: 410\u2013414)], cerebrovascular disease (ICD-9: 430\u2013438), respiratory disease (ICD-9: 460\u2013519), and lung cancer (ICD-9: 162).",
            "Covariates.",
            "We considered age, sex, and several variables at the baseline as potential confounders: marital status (married, single, separated/divorced, or widowed), place of birth (Rome or other), level of education (university, high school, secondary, or primary), and occupation [top qualified non-manual employed (i.e., managers, university and high school professors, researchers); other non-manual employed; manual labor employed; other employed (i.e., armed forces and retail sales); housewife; unemployed; retired; other].",
            "Some studies have shown that neighborhood socioeconomic level is associated with smoking, after accounting for individual education and occupation.",
            "Therefore, we adjusted estimates for a five-level small-area (census block) socioeconomic position index that is based on 2001 census data in Rome (5,500 census blocks, average population of 500 subjects per block) and was derived based on a factor analysis including education, occupation, house ownership, family composition, crowding, and immigrant status.",
            "In addition, because data on lifestyles were unavailable, we adjusted a subset of models for preexisting comorbidities related to smoking habits or diet [diabetes (ICD-9 code 250), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; ICD-9: 490\u2013492, and 496), and hypertensive heart disease (ICD-9: 401\u2013404)] that were identified based on the principal and up to five secondary diagnoses indicated on hospital discharges from October 1996 to October 2001.",
            "Statistical analyses.",
            "We investigated the correlation between exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient.",
            "We used Cox proportional hazards regression models [hazard ratios (HRs)] with time-dependent exposures and age as the time scale to estimate associations between air pollution exposure and cause-specific mortality.",
            "We first calculated HRs adjusted for sex only (model 1); then adjusted for individual covariates (marital status, place of birth, education, occupation) and the small area socioeconomic position indicator (model 2); and finally, we adjusted also for preexisting comorbidities [diabetes, hypertensive heart disease, and COPD (model 3)].",
            "When analyzing respiratory mortality with model 3, we adjusted for diabetes and hypertensive heart disease only.",
            "We estimated associations with the pollutants using several different scales: quintiles of the distributions, 10-\u00b5g/m3 increases, and interquartile range (IQR) increases.",
            "To estimate the overall effects of NO2 and PM2.5, we modeled each pollutant in turn (single-pollutant models), and estimated independent effects of each pollutant by including both PM2.5 and NO2 in the same multivariable Cox model (bi-pollutant model).",
            "We also adjusted single-pollutant models for traffic intensity and distance to an HTR.",
            "In addition, we evaluated potential effect modification by including an interaction term between exposure (NO2 or PM2.5, in turn) and one effect modifier at a time [sex, age group, educational level, small area socioeconomic position, and residential stability (i.e., a binary variable indicating whether the subject had ever changed the residential address)] and used likelihood ratio tests to compare the fit of models with and without interaction terms.",
            "We considered p-values < 0.05 as indication of statistical significance, and we performed Wald tests to test the trend across quintiles of exposures (treated as ordinal categorical variables coded using integer values 1\u20135).",
            "Neighborhoods are usually inhabited by residents with similar characteristics (socioeconomic, health, access to services) and similar environmental exposures, which means that confounding and clustering in the association between exposure and mortality should be investigated.",
            "In a sensitivity analysis, we performed a frailty model to investigate the role of both neighborhood and district (Rome is divided into 94 neighborhoods and into 19 districts).",
            "We explored the shape of relationships between exposures and outcomes by replacing the linear term in the base model with natural splines with 2, 3, or 4 degrees of freedom (df), which capture potential nonlinearity in the data without overfitting.",
            "We used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the likelihood ratio test to compare the relative goodness of fit of the models.",
            "We used STATA10 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) for all statistical analyses with the exception of the frailty models and spline plots, for which we used R (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).",
            "Because R was not able to deal with a large number of records for the amount of computer memory available, for the spline and frailty analyses we studied a 20% random sample of the study population and used fixed time-weighted exposures between October 1996 and October 2001.",
            "We applied the appropriate weights to natural spline models to plot effects for the entire population.",
            "Results",
            "A total of 1,265,058 residents were included in the study.",
            "The average exposure levels of the population [mean (SD, range, 25th percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile)] at baseline were 43.6 \u00b5g/m3 (8.4, 13.0\u201375.2, 38.5, 44.5, 49.2) for NO2, and 23.0 \u00b5g/m3 (4.4, 7.2\u201332.1, 20.3, 23.9, 26.0) for PM2.5.",
            "The average distance to an HTR was 232 m (224, 2\u2013946, 80, 165, 308), and the average traffic intensity within a 150 m buffer zone was 4.1 \u00d7 106 vehicles/m (5.3 \u00d7 106, 0\u201388.9 \u00d7 106, 0.6 \u00d7 106, 5.4 \u00d7 106, 5.5 \u00d7 106).",
            "We found a high correlation between NO2 and PM2.5 exposures (0.79).",
            "Figure 1 maps the concentrations of the two pollutants in Rome.",
            "The highest levels of air pollution are in the city center and in the eastern part of Rome.",
            "The resolution of the exposure model for NO2 is clearly higher than for PM2.5.",
            "From October 2001 to December 2010 (average length of follow-up: 8.3 years), 9.5% of the study population emigrated, and 12% died.",
            "There were 144,441 nonaccidental deaths (95.8% of all deaths), and the crude mortality rate (CMR) was 13.8 per 10,000 person-years.",
            "Cardiovascular causes were responsible for 40% of all deaths (CMR = 5.8) [including IHD (15% of deaths, CMR = 2.2) and cerebrovascular diseases (9% of deaths, CMR = 1.3)]; respiratory diseases and lung cancer accounted for 6% (CMR = 0.8) and 8% of all deaths (CMR = 1.2), respectively.",
            "The majority of the cohort (75.3%) did not change address from October 1996 to the end of follow-up, whereas a change in address within the city was registered for the other 311,728 residents.",
            "Residents with higher levels of NO2 exposure were older, better educated, and more likely to live alone, closer to HTRs, and more exposed to traffic compared with residents who had lower levels of exposure [see Supplemental Material, Table S1 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1205862)].",
            "Air pollution and mortality.",
            "Although there was little or no evidence of an association between any of the indices of exposure and nonaccidental, cardiovascular disease, or IHD mortality based on the crude model (model 1, adjusted for sex only), there was strong evidence of an association between all exposure indicators and these outcomes when we adjusted for personal characteristics and area-based socioeconomic position (model 2) (Table 1).",
            "The variables most responsible for the differences between the two models were education, occupation, and area-based socioeconomic position index (data not shown).",
            "The magnitude of the estimated effects on nonaccidental mortality was similar for NO2 and PM2.5, with a gradual increase in mortality across the quintiles of NO2 and PM2.5, as well as categories of traffic intensity and distance to HTRs.",
            "Although the ptrend was < 0.05 in the association between proximity to HTRs and mortality, only those living < 50 m from an HTR had a statistically significant higher mortality risk compared with those living \u2265 250 m from an HTR.",
            "Associations with the different exposure indexes followed similar patterns for cardiovascular disease and IHD mortality, and the estimated effects were stronger for IHD mortality than all other causes.",
            "Table 2 shows the results of cerebrovascular, respiratory, and lung-cancer mortality.",
            "There was evidence of an association between PM2.5 exposure and cerebrovascular mortality, with an 8% higher risk per 10-\u00b5g/m3 PM2.5 (model 2; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.13), but associations with NO2 and proxy measures of traffic exposure were weaker and not statistically significant.",
            "There was some evidence of an effect of NO2 and traffic intensity on respiratory disease mortality.",
            "There was strong evidence of an association between lung-cancer mortality and both NO2 and PM2.5, but not with proxy measures of traffic exposure.",
            "Estimated associations with NO2 and PM2.5 were similar or slightly stronger for all outcomes when we also adjusted for preexisting comorbidity [see Supplemental Material, Table S2 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1205862)].",
            "Associations with 10-\u00b5g/m3 increases in NO2 and PM2.5 (performed on a 20% random sample) were similar when estimated using the standard Cox model (model 2), the frailty model with districts, and frailty model with neighborhoods [see Supplemental Material, Table S3 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1205862)].",
            "The effect estimates in the 20% sample were very similar to those obtained for the entire data set, with the only exception of the PM2.5\u2013lung cancer association, which was clearly underestimated.",
            "Figure 2 shows estimated concentration\u2013response curves (natural splines, 2 df) for nonaccidental mortality, cardiovascular, IHD, and lung-cancer mortality for NO2 (Figure 2A) and PM2.5 (Figure 2B) based on a 20% random sample of the study population.",
            "In general, the results showed no evidence of deviation from linearity (based on BIC), with the only exception being the association between NO2 exposure and IHD mortality (likelihood ratio test comparing the linear and the spline model with 2 df gave a p-value = 0.028, although with very similar BIC).",
            "Results were similar for natural splines with 3 or 4 df (data not shown).",
            "Despite the high correlation between the two pollutants, the estimated effect of a 10-\u00b5g/m3 increase in NO2 on nonaccidental mortality was still statistically significant when adjusted for PM2.5 in a bi-pollutant model [model 2; HR = 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.03)].",
            "In contrast, the estimated effect of PM2.5 decreased when adjusted for NO2 [HR = 1.01 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.02) for a 10-\u00b5g/m3 increase in PM2.5 compared with HR = 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.05) based on the single pollutant model].",

            "There was some suggestion of effect modification by age (with < 60-year-olds at higher risk than \u2265 75-year-olds), by residential stability (with non-movers at higher risk than movers), and by sex (with men at higher risk than women) for nonaccidental and cardiovascular mortality (for PM2.5 only).",
            "Discussion",
            "We found statistically significant positive associations between long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 and nonaccidental, cardiovascular, IHD, and lung-cancer mortality in the adult population of Rome.",
            "In addition, exposure to PM2.5 was associated with cerebrovascular mortality, whereas NO2 exposure was associated with respiratory mortality.",
            "Proximity to HTRs and high traffic intensity were associated with nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and IHD mortality.",
            "Despite the high correlation of the pollutants, NO2 was significantly associated with mortality when adjusted for PM2.5, although the estimated effect of PM2.5 was no longer significant.",
            "There was no evidence of deviation from linearity of the effects of either NO2 or PM2.5 on nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and lung-cancer mortality.",
            "The estimated effects on nonaccidental mortality tended to be stronger in males, younger subjects (< 60 years of age), and non-movers.",
            "Average exposure of the cohort was slightly higher than in other study populations from Europe or North America, but near the values being discussed as potential European standards (40 \u00b5g/m3 for NO2 and 20 \u00b5g/m3 for PM2.5).",
            "The mean concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 (in Rome: 44 \u00b5g/m3 and 23 \u00b5g/m3, respectively) ranged from 32.1 and 4.1 \u00b5g/m3 in Canada to 39 \u00b5g/m3 NO2 in Germany, and to 28.3 \u00b5g/m3 PM2.5, respectively, in the Netherlands.",
            "The associations we found for the selected causes of mortality were comparable with, but slightly lower than, those reported in other European and North American settings.",
            "The 4% (95% CI: 3, 5%) higher risk of nonaccidental mortality per 10-\u00b5g/m3 PM2.5 in Rome was comparable to the 6% higher risk (95% CI: 3, 9%) reported based on a meta-analysis of five studies, whereas the 3% (95% CI: 2, 3%) estimated increase in risk per 10-\u00b5g/m3 NO2 was lower than the meta-analytic estimate of 6% (95% CI: 4, 8%) based on four European studies [data reported in ].",
            "As expected, associations with IHD and cardiovascular mortality were stronger than with other causes of death.",
            "Linear association between the pollutant exposures and cause-specific mortality were reported in some previous studies.",
            "The shapes of the NO2 curves were similar to estimates reported for a study population in Olso, Norway.",
            "Although stronger estimated effects for non-movers may simply reflect improved exposure estimation, evidence of higher risks in men compared with women deserves additional attention.",
            "Evidence of sex differences in susceptibility to air pollution is controversial.",
            "In the United States, an association between exposure to PM10 (particles with a diameter \u2264 10 \u00b5m)and mortality was reported for women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study but not for men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.",
            "However, reported strong evidence of an effect of black carbon on coronary heart disease mortality (after adjusting for NO2 and PM2.5) in men but not women.",
            "We estimated the strongest effects in the youngest age group of our population (< 60 years), consistent with a previous study.",
            "Our study has several strengths.",
            "It is the largest European cohort study of the effects of both NO2 and PM2.5 and provides the statistical power to detect the effects of different indices of exposure on mortality.",
            "Residential history and several individual characteristics were available, and we had estimates of both NO2 and PM2.5 at the residences of all subjects.",
            "This study has some limitations.",
            "The RoLS is a cohort built on administrative data and information on individual risk factors such as smoking habits, diet, alcohol consumption, and obesity were not available.",
            "As previously done in the literature, we adjusted the models for preexisting diabetes, COPD, and hypertensive heart disease\u2014conditions which share the lifestyle risk factors cited.",
            "We adjusted also for small-area socioeconomic position, which could be a predictor of smoking habits independent of personal characteristics (Diex Roux et al. 2003).",
            "The adjustment for preexisting conditions might have led to an underestimation of the effect, because the comorbidities might act as intermediate variables.",
            "To further investigate the role of smoking, we selected 7,845 adult subjects from the study population for whom information on smoking habits was available from another investigation (the Italian Studies on Respiratory Disorders in Childhood and Environment (SIDRIA) study).",
            "Once we adjusted for all covariates used in model 2 in a logistic regression model predicting ever smoking, there was no evidence of an association between exposure to NO2 or PM2.5 and ever smoking (all odds ratios close to 1.0), indicating that smoking is unrelated to the exposures and thus an unlikely confounder.",
            "Moreover, when we added smoking status in a survival analysis (model 2) restricted only to SIDRIA participants, the association between the air pollution exposures and nonaccidental mortality did not change (data not shown).",
            "To analyze frailty and concentration\u2013response curves we had to use a 20% random sample of the population, but these alternate models provided only slightly different estimates of the effects for nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and IHD mortality.",
            "Therefore, we expect that frailty analyses of the entire population would be comparable.",
            "On the other hand, PM2.5 effect estimates for lung cancer based on the 20% sample were quite different (close to unity) from estimates based on the entire population, and therefore the relative spline plot should be interpreted cautiously.",
            "To estimate NO2 and PM2.5 exposure we used both an LUR model based on measurements carried out on 2007 and a dispersion model based on simulation for the year 2005, respectively.",
            "Both models were independently validated [see Supplemental Material, pp. 2\u20133 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1205862)].",
            "PM2.5 and NO2 were highly correlated, but PM2.5 estimates had a lower resolution than estimates for NO2.",
            "We are fairly confident that the spatial gradient of pollutants within the city remained stable over time.",
            "Rome is a city that changes very slowly, as two NO2 LUR models developed using measures taken 12 years apart showed very similar results both in terms of estimates of exposure of the population (the correlation was 0.96) and in their associations with natural mortality.",
            "We took into account the changes of address (and exposure) during the follow-up in the main time-dependent analyses.",
            "Conversely, we used time-weighted exposure for the 5 years before enrollment, without taking account of changes of address, for frailty models and spline curves.",
            "We have evaluated that the bias introduced in this way is negligible because the results on the entire population based on 1996\u20132001 average exposure were similar to those obtained with time-dependent exposure (data not shown).",
            "Conclusions",
            "Long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 was associated with increased mortality in this large population-based cohort.",
            "We found the strongest associations with IHD, followed by cardiovascular and lung-cancer mortality.",
            "The estimated effect of NO2 persisted after adjusting for PM2.5, and the shapes of the concentration response for both pollutants showed no evidence of deviation from linearity for all causes except IHD.",
            "European policy decisions regarding environment and public health should be made with consideration of the specific scientific research results on the health effects of air pollution, such as those provided here."

            "Introduction",
            "Breast cancer is the major cancer affecting women with a lifetime risk of more than 10% in the general population in Western countries.",
            "The prevalence is, however, much lower in Asia and many economically developing countries (1).",
            "However, Asian immigrants to the United States acquire the prevalence of that country within one generation, indicating a strong effect of environmental exposures.",
            "Although the majority of primary breast cancer is estrogen-driven and often responsive to endocrine treatment, many patients progress to estrogen-insensitive disease with poor prognosis (2,3).",
            "A critical determinant of such pro-gression is the loss of the estrogen receptor-a (ER), which is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and the loss of sensitivity to endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen (3).",
            "ER can stimulate cellular proliferation via progesterone receptor (PgR) induction and transcriptional upregulation of cyclin D1, leading to enhanced cell-cycle progression, whereas ER loss has been associated with enhanced motility and metastatic abilities of breast cancer cells.",
            "Although loss of ER activity and expression has critical consequences for breast cancers, it generally occurs without evidence of ER gene mutation or deletion.",
            "Alterations in ER levels can be regulated at transcriptional or posttranscriptional stages, or through epigenetic mechanisms (4).",
            "Given that the prevalence of breast cancer varies between different geographic locations, potential modifiable environmental, dietary, and lifestyle determinants may also influence the ER status.",
            "The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family has been identified as an additional driver of breast cancer.",
            "The mitogenic and antiapoptotic signals are mediated via the IGF type I receptor (IGFIR) and its downstream targets MAPK-ERK or PI3K-Akt.",
            "The ER and IGFIR signaling systems are tightly linked and subject to feedback cross-talk.",
            "For example, estrogen and IGFs coregulate several genes that affect breast cancer outcome (5).",
            "In addition, hyperactive IGFIR-PI3K-Akt signaling has been implicated to contribute in the acquisition of resistance to endocrine therapy during breast cancer progression (6).",
            "Estrogen increases IGFIR mRNA and antiestrogens, like tamoxifen, can reduce serum IGFI levels and IGF-mediated growth (7,8).",
            "Conversely, blocking IGF actions can inhibit estrogen-mediated growth (9).",
            "Similar to ER activity, various anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary factors can influence the IGF system with impact on cancer development and progression.",
            "In recent years, mechanisms involved in mediating cancer chemopreventive effects of naturally derived plant polyphenols from green tea and coffee have been widely studied in several neoplasias, including breast and prostate cancer (10)(11)(12)(13).",
            "However, there have been few translational studies on anticancer effects of coffee in relation to ER status in breast cancer.",
            "Prospective and retrospective epidemiologic studies show an association between coffee consumption and a significantly reduced risk, delayed onset, and reduced growth of breast cancer (14,15).",
            "Coffee beans are one of the richest dietary sources of the antioxidants caffeine and the plant phenolic compound caffeic acid, both of which may be mechanistically involved in the cancersuppressive properties of coffee.",
            "Various dietary and lifestyle factors are also known to influence the sensitivity to cancer treatment (10,16).",
            "In line with this, our group recently showed in a subset of the present study cohort, that moderate to high coffee consumption was associated with improved disease-free survival among ER \u00fe tamoxifen-treated women (17).",
            "The aim of the present translational study was to investigate the effect of coffee consumption on tumor characteristics and diseasefree survival in an extended cohort of women with breast cancer in Sweden, and to establish underlying molecular mechanisms by which coffee constituents may affect breast cancer cell growth in relation to ER status.",

            "At 1 mmol/L caffeine, the proliferation was reduced by 80% in MCF-7 cells (P < 0.01) and by 40% in MDA-MB-231 cells (P \u00bc 0.054).",
            "Similarly, caffeic acid reduced both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth, although to a lesser extent than caffeine (Fig. 1A).",
            "A concomitant increase in cell death was observed for MCF-7, but not for MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1A).",
            "The response to caffeine and caffeic acid were identical in the Tam-R cells as with the parental MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1B).",
            "The caffeine-induced cell death in MCF-7 was associated with reduced prosurvival Bcl-xL levels whereas increased active caspase-7 and cleaved PARP, a signature event of apoptosis (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1).",
            "These results demonstrate that caffeine, but also caffeic acid, suppress the proliferation of human breast cancer cells, and suggest that ER \u00fe tumors may be more sensitive to the growth inhibiting properties of the coffee constituents.",
            "Coffee constituents impair the cell-cycle progression in breast cancer cells",
            "Having demonstrated that caffeine and caffeic acid suppressed the proliferation and viability of breast cancer cells, we further assessed their effect on cell-cycle distribution.",
            "Increasing doses of caffeine resulted in impaired G 1 to S transition in both ER \u00fe MCF-7 (P 0.003; Fig. 2A andC) and ER \u00c0 MDA-MB-231 (P 0.001; Fig. 2B andD) cells, with an accumulation of cells in G 0 -G 1 , a subsequent reduction of cells in S and G 2 -M phases and enhanced cell death.",
            "Although caffeic acid reduced MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell densities (Fig. 2A andB), only minor modulations of the cell-cycle distribution by caffeic acid were observed in the ER \u00fe (Fig. 2A andC) as well as ER \u00c0 cells (Fig. 2B andD).",
            "Caffeine and caffeic acid alter hormone receptor levels and downstream effectors in breast cancer cells",
            "The role of coffee constituents in modulating molecular mechanisms with impact on breast cancer cell growth in relation to ER status was further investigated.",
            "Exposure to caffeine significantly reduced the ER abundance in ER \u00fe MCF-7 cells.",
            "In fact, 5 mmol/L caffeine almost completely abolished the ER levels (Fig. 3A).",
            "Although an approximately 50% reduction of MCF-7 proliferation was obtained by caffeic acid treatment, the effect on ER abundance was less pronounced (Fig. 3A).",
            "The ER suppression was associated with a concomitant cyclin D1 decrease, and no detectable levels remained after 5 mmol/L caffeine exposure (Fig. 3A).",
            "In contrast, caffeine exposure resulted in reexpression of ER and cyclin D1 in ER \u00c0 MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3B).",
            "However, caffeine did not under these conditions reactivate ER protein expression to the endogenous ER levels seen in untreated MCF-7 cells.",
            "Caffeine exposure was further associated with a 70% and a 25% reduction in IGFIR abundance in MCF-7 (Fig. 3A) and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3B), respectively, when compared with control.",
            "Increasing doses of caffeine resulted in a concomitant dosedependent and complete inhibition of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3).",
            "In line with the lower magnitude in growth inhibition by caffeic acid, a 30% reduction in IGFIR levels was observed for MCF-7, but not for MDA-MB-231 cells, although a !50% reduction in Akt phosphorylation was found for both cell types following caffeic acid exposure.",
            "These results demonstrate that caffeine and caffeic acid significantly alter ER and cyclin D1 levels, and suppress the IGFIR-pAkt signaling pathway in both ER \u00fe and ER \u00c0 breast cancer cells.",
            "Coffee consumption and reduced risk of early breast cancer recurrence",
            "Finally, impact by coffee consumption on breast cancer prognosis was evaluated.",
            "Patients were followed for up to 9 years (median 3.0 years, IQR 1.0-5.1).",
            "During the study period, 100 of 1,082 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer recurrence, of them 65 patients had distant metastases.",
            "In total 76 deaths occurred, of which 45 had reported breast cancer event before death.",
            "Coffee consumption alone was not associated with disease prognosis overall or when stratifying according to ER status (all adjusted Ps ! 0.22).",
            "However, the disease-free survival was significantly improved among tamoxifen-treated women with ER \u00fe tumors drinking 2 or more cups of coffee per day (log-rank P \u00bc 0.013; Fig. 4).",
            "Among these women there was a 49% decreased hazard of early breast cancer recurrence when drinking moderate to high amounts of coffee compared with low coffee consumption, adjusted HR 0.51 (95% CI, 0.26-0.97; P \u00bc 0.040).",
            "In contrast, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival in relation to coffee consumption among women with ER \u00fe tumors treated with aromatase inhibitors, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy (all adjusted Ps ! 0.26).",
            "In vitro evaluation of the effects on cell proliferation of the combined exposure of tamoxifen and caffeine or caffeic acid showed that the response to the coffee constituents were maintained and additive to the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen in both ER \u00fe MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells (data not shown).",
            "Discussion",
            "A growing body of literature indicates that modifiable dietary or lifestyle factors, such as coffee, may have a protective role against the risk or progression of breast cancer (14,15,17).",
            "In the present translational study, we demonstrate an association between increasing coffee consumption and significantly smaller invasive tumor sizes, whereas concomitantly lower proportion of ER \u00fe tumors among women with breast cancer.",
            "Moreover, in the present study, mechanistic in vitro data show that caffeine and caffeic acid attenuated the growth of predominantly ER \u00fe , but also ER \u00c0 , human breast cancer cells by modulating ER and IGFIR levels with impact on downstream effectors and cell-cycle progression.",
            "Finally, the present study demonstrate that tamoxifen-treated women with ER \u00fe tumors drinking 2 or more cups of coffee per day show a significantly reduced risk of early breast cancer recurrence, compared with women with low daily coffee consumption.",
            "Several epidemiologic reports suggest that coffee consumption decreases breast cancer risk (14,25,26), whereas other studies report no association between coffee intake and breast cancer risk (27).",
            "However, relatively few studies have examined the association with risk or progression by ER status.",
            "Sweden is among the top coffee consuming countries worldwide, and less than 1% of the coffee consumed is decaffeinated (28).",
            "Coffee contains a mixture of bioactive components, and there are several plausible biologic pathways whereby coffee might alter breast cancer risk or progression.",
            "Caffeine and the polyphenol constituents have been suggested to contribute to its anticancer activities.",
            "However, various coffee constituents may differentially affect ER \u00fe and ER \u00c0 breast cancer subtypes.",
            "The present findings demonstrate smaller invasive tumor sizes, whereas concomitant lower proportion of ER \u00fe tumors and consequently higher proportion of ER \u00c0 tumors with increasing coffee consumption.",
            "These findings from almost twice as many women, confirm the previous report from a subset of the present cohort (17).",
            "When stratifying according to ER status, the association between increasing coffee consumption and smaller invasive tumor size was only observed in ER \u00fe tumors, suggesting that coffee suppresses breast tumor growth, and that ER \u00fe tumors may be more sensitive to these effects.",
            "A previous report demonstrated a protective effect of caffeine intake on both ER \u00fe and ER \u00c0 breast cancer risk in the Nurses' Health Study, although only significant for the ER \u00fe group ( 25).",
            "Although at the same time, no association with caffeine intake and overall breast cancer risk in the Women's Health Study was reported, the proportion of ER \u00fe tumors was decreased and the proportion ER \u00c0 tumors increased (29).",
            "The shifted ER proportions are in line with both the clinical and experimental data in the present study.",
            "Several studies have described caffeine and caffeic acid as anticarcinogenic agents in various cell culture and in vivo models (30,31).",
            "For instance, in hepatocellular carcinoma and epidermal JB6 cells, caffeine attenuated cell growth via induction of G 0 -G 1 cell-cycle arrest (32,33).",
            "Furthermore, caffeine-mediated inhibition of metastatic potential have been demonstrated for melanoma cells (34).",
            "Caffeine has also been shown to inhibit skin cancer in mice by enhancing UVB-induced apoptosis (35).",
            "The experimental doses used in the present study are equivalent to previous in vitro studies (30)(31)(32)(33), although the higher doses are above the physiologic achievable systemic doses.",
            "Translating experimental in vitro doses to human in vivo settings frequently requires significant dose adjustments due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters along with differences in acute in vitro exposure versus cumulative effects following long-term exposure.",
            "Our present results demonstrate that predominantly caffeine, and to a lesser extent caffeic acid, inhibited the proliferation of ER \u00fe MCF-7 and ER \u00c0 MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.",
            "In line with our clinical observations, the ER \u00fe breast cancer cells appeared more sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects by the coffee constituents compared with ER \u00c0 cells.",
            "Interestingly, the growth inhibitory property by caffeine on ER \u00fe MCF-7 cells was associated with a significant reduction in ER abundance.",
            "A moderate effect was also found for caffeic acid.",
            "Downregulation of ER function and expression with subsequent growth inhibition has previously been demonstrated for green tea polyphenolic catechenins (EGCC) and the structurally related plant flavonoid wogonin (12,13).",
            "In a similar manner to these dietary constituents, caffeine mimicked the actions of the antiestrogen fulvestrant (ICI 182,780), which inhibits ER-dependent functions and decreases ER expression, resulting in suppression of tumor cell growth (36).",
            "Similarly, endoxifen, the bioactive metabolite of tamoxifen, inhibits estrogen-induced breast cancer growth by competitively binding ER, leading to inhibition of ER transcriptional activity and targeting ER to proteasomal degradation (37).",
            "In addition, a recent study described that a derivative of caffeic acid (CAPE) specifically bound and downregulated ER expression (38).",
            "Caffeine affected ER levels differently in ER \u00fe versus ER \u00c0 breast cancer cell lines.",
            "Surprisingly, the caffeine and caffeic acid-induced growth inhibition of ER \u00c0 MDA-MB-231 cells was associated with a reexpression of ER protein abundance.",
            "MDA-MB-231 cells have densely methylated ER CpG islands and epigenetic repression via promoter methylation has been suggested to be the predominant mechanism for ER downregulation in ER \u00c0 tumors (39).",
            "Caffeic acid has been reported to influence epigenetic repression and to reactivate methylationsilenced genes (40).",
            "However, the modulation of ER levels in the present study appeared to involve other mechanisms as initial investigation of the methylation of the ER promoter using Combined Bisulphite Restriction Assay revealed no effect of the coffee constituents (data not shown).",
            "Further studies are needed to identify whether other epigenetic changes such as histone acetylation played a role or whether nonepigenetic mechanisms were involved in the caffeine and caffeic acid induce reexpression of ER in ER \u00c0 cells.",
            "ER directly activates the cyclin D1 promoter, and has been demonstrated to be capable of stimulating cell-cycle progression in the absence of peptide growth factors (41).",
            "In addition, cyclin D1 can stimulate ER transcriptional activity in the absence of estrogen (42).",
            "The caffeine-mediated ER downregulation in ER \u00fe cells was associated with a concomitant cyclin D1 reduction, impaired G 1 to S cell-cycle transition, reduced growth, and induction of apoptosis.",
            "This is potentially important as cyclin D1 gene amplification and protein overexpression is associated with impaired tamoxifen response (43), and if coffee constituents modify cyclin D1 levels this may potentially augment tamoxifen treatment response.",
            "However, cyclin D1 appears to have contrasting effects in ER \u00fe and ER \u00c0 cells.",
            "Although overexpression of cyclin D1 may promote treatment resistance and a metastatic phenotype in ER \u00fe cells, it appears to decrease migration and mammosphere formation in ER \u00c0 breast cancer cells (43)(44)(45).",
            "Such contrasting effects may explain the divergent regulation of ER and cyclin D1 by caffeine in ER \u00fe versus ER \u00c0 cells, both resulting in growth inhibition.",
            "In addition to modulating ER and cyclin D1 levels, caffeine treatment dose-dependently downregulated the growth and antiapoptotic IGFIR levels with subsequent impaired Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which may partially contribute to the reduced cell proliferation observed.",
            "This is to our knowledge, the first study to show a direct effect of caffeine on IGFIR regulation.",
            "Previously, inhibition of IGFIR signaling by green tea polyphenols as measured by reduced pAkt and pErk1/2, has been shown to reduce prostate cancer progression and invasion in the TRAMP mouse model (11).",
            "The IGF and  estrogen growth regulatory pathways are tightly linked and compensatory mechanisms by the IGFIR have been suggested to mediate cell proliferation in tamoxifen-resistant tumors (46).",
            "Therapies targeting IGFIR may, thus, be of clinical benefit for treatment of such cancers.",
            "The association between increasing coffee consumption and reduced risk of early breast cancer recurrence among tamoxifen-treated women with ER \u00fe tumors in the present study may mechanistically be linked to the altered ER and impaired IGFIR signaling by enhanced exposure to the coffee constituents.",
            "This could sensitize the tumor cells to further inhibitory effects by tamoxifen with improved clinical response rate.",
            "These findings are consistent with and support the previous report showing an association between increasing coffee consumption and significantly increased disease-free survival among tamoxifen-treated women with ER \u00fe tumors, in a subset of the present cohort (17).",
            "The present cell work demonstrates that caffeine and caffeic acid have inhibitory effects that are at least additive with the effects of tamoxifen.",
            "It appears that the inhibitory effects of caffeine and caffeic acid on ER \u00fe cells are maintained and not diminished when the ER is either inactive or effectively blocked.",
            "Furthermore, it is possible that coffee consumption could alter the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen via, for example, CYP1A2 or CYP2C8 (17), but that would require examination in an approin vivo model.",
            "In summary, this study shows inhibitory effects by caffeine and caffeic acid on breast cancer cell growth.",
            "These results are in line with previous epidemiologic reports demonstrating protective roles of coffee constituents and the risk or progression of breast cancer.",
            "The present findings enhance the general understanding of how modifiable factors present in our daily diet, such as coffee constituents, may alter ER status, IGFIR levels, and contribute to reduced growth of ER \u00fe and ER \u00c0 breast cancer cells.",

            "The structural difference between PdG and HOPdG is the presence or absence of a hydroxyl group, whereas M1G and HOPdG also differ by the pi character of the exocyclic ring of M1G (Fig. 1).",
            "An analogy may be drawn to the study of Langouet and coworkers (25), which demonstrated that ethano-dG and etheno-dG, the five-membered homologues of PdG and M1G, are mutagenic in E. coli, whereas HO-ethano-dG, the homologue of HOPdG, is only weakly mutagenic.",
            "The lack of mutations induced by HOPdG is not the result of it being a strong block to in vivo replication or to its removal by repair systems, as demonstrated by the use of single-stranded vectors in mutagenesis assays.",
            "One possible explanation for HOPdG's nonmutagenic nature is that the structure of HOPdG may exist in multiple forms, where one form is miscoding but the other not (Fig.4\n).",
            "A related interconversion has been observed for M1G, which exists in a hydrolytically ring-opened form (N\n2-(3-oxopropenyl)-dG) when it is opposite dC residues but in the ring-closed form when it is opposite dT residues (Fig. 4).",
            "The ring-opened form appears to be substantially less mutagenic than the ring-closed form.",
            "One can postulate the existence of an analogous ring-opened form for HOPdG in which the ring-opened form, N\n2-(3-oxopropanyl)-dG, would be expected to be substantially less mutagenic.",
            "In fact, a very recent study by de los Santos et al. (26) indicates that HOPdG exists entirely in the ring-opened form in duplex DNA and that the ring-opened form hydrogen bonds effectively to dC residues.",
            "This type of interconversion of opened and closed forms of exocyclic adducts may account for the low mutagenicity of HO-ethano-dG as speculated by Langouet et al. (25).",
            "The relevance of our results to the mutagenicity and tumor-initiating activity of acrolein is supported by recent studies by Yang and coworkers (27), who reported that HOPdG was not mutagenic in E. coli.",
            "It seems unlikely that HOPdG is the principal adduct responsible for acrolein mutagenicity.",
            "This suggests that the mutagenic effects are mediated by other acrolein-DNA adducts.",
            "Isomeric 6-HOPdG isomers are formed on reaction of acrolein with DNA in vitroand have been detected in human tissue (12, 13, 15).",
            "Even if 6-HOPdG ring-opens in duplex DNA, it will still contain a 3-oxopropanyl group on N1 of dG, which should alter translesion synthesis.",
            "In addition, there are other adducts that may contribute to the genotoxicity of acrolein.",
            "Recently, Wang et al. (28) reported that the hydrolysis product of crotonaldehyde-\u03b2-hydroxybutyraldehyde adds to the exocyclic amino group of deoxyguanosine to form unstable imine adducts.",
            "The imine adducts are present in concentrations 50-fold higher than those of the 6-methyl-8-hydroxypropanodeoxyguanosine adduct generated by reaction of deoxyguanosine with crotonaldehyde.",
            "It is likely that related N\n2-imino adducts are formed by reaction of deoxyguanosine residues with hydrated acrolein (i.e. 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde).",
            "It will be interesting to evaluate the mutagenicity of these adducts using site-specific procedures analogous to those described in the present work.",
            "However, the chemical instability of these novel exocyclic andN\n2 adducts may make this a formidable experimental challenge.",
            "Acknowledgments",
            "We thank C. Rouzer for a critical reading of the manuscript.",
            "We are very grateful to M. Moriya and C. de los Santos for sharing the results of their experiments with HOPdG prior to publication."

            "Since venous drainage from the spleen passes through the liver, hor- mones produced by the grafted ovary are metabolized, and thus, the feedback necessary to prevent release of pituitary gonadotropins is interrupted.",
            "The result is continued production of pituitary gonadotropin, which stimulates celi proliferation in the grafted ovary and leads to development of granulosa cell tumors.",

            "Tricre- sylphosphate will ultimately be tested for carcinogenicity in 2-year studies.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Based upon review of the completed and uncompleted toxicity and carcinogenicity studies for the eight chem- icals described, some general conclusions and consid- erations regarding pathologic evaluation of ovarian tissues seem justified.",
            "First, the occurrence of treatmentassociated ovarian lesions in 90-day and 2-year rodent studies is not common.",
            "To date, more than 300 chemicals have been tested in 90-day and/or 2-year carcinogenicity studies.",
            "Significant treatment-related ovarian effects were found in only eight of these studies.",
            "This probably represents an underestimate of the true incidence of treatment-associated ovarian pathologic changes, since in past years, 90-day studies were used primarily to set doses for 2-year studies rather than to define subtle toxicity.",
            "Consequently, in the absence of grossly visible changes, one would not expect ovarian tissues to have been examined as critically in the past as is currently done.",
            "Despite the possibility that there may be more than eight studies in which ovarian lesions were induced by treatment, it is still reasonable to conclude that the frequency of ovarian target tissue toxicity is not high in conventional rodent toxicity and carcinogenicity stud- ies.",
            "Ovarian function and dysfunction are intimately linked with the hypothalamus, the pituitary, the uterus, and other endocrine organs.",
            "Thus, the observation that treatment-associated ovarian changes were frequently associated with pathologic alterations in other tissues (e.g., adrenal, uterus) in the eight NTP chemical studies is not surprising.",
            "In fact, the low probability that ovar- ian lesions would occur in isolation should prompt the pathologist to closely examine all parts of the HPOU and endocrine systems whenever a lesion is found in one component of this system.",
            "Closer examination of these other tissues may reveal subtle but important changes not noted on the initial pathologic examination.",
            "The ovarian lesions documented in the NTP studies covered by this paper provide supportive evidence that alterations noted in ovaries of treated rodents at the conclusion of a 90-day study may herald the ultimate development of ovarian neoplasia upon continued treat- ment.",
            "A relationship between antecedent ovarian hy- poplasia, atrophy, and hyperplasia and subsequent ovarian neoplasia has been previously proposed (17)(18)(19)(20)(21).",
            "Consequently, when ovarian changes are observed in treated animals in prechronic toxicity studies, special study design considerations (e.g., adding extra females, interim sacrifices, vaginal cytology, hormone measurements) might be warranted in subsequent carcinogen- icity/chronic toxicity studies.",
            "Definitive reproductive studies would also be warranted when ovarian lesions occur in a 90-day study.",
            "Histopathologic distinction between ovarian atrophy and hypoplasia in rodents cannot be reliably made on the basis of examination of tissues only at the conclusion of a 90-day study.",
            "Atrophy implies that the organ was fully formed and then lost some of its mature structure.",
            "Hypoplasia implies that the ovary is being well formed but is smaller than normal (a form of ovarian dysge- nesis).",
            "At the end of a typical 90-day study, the rats or mice are approximately 20 weeks of age, and ovarian tissues would be expected to be fully developed and functional.",
            "The observation of atrophy or hypoplasia at this point is problematic in that the pathologist does not know if the ovary became fully developed and then underwent atrophy or if the ovary never fully developed in the first place and was thus hypoplastic.",
            "Since the distinction between atrophy and hypoplasia may be me- chanistically important, it would be appropriate either to repeat the study and to sample ovarian tissue at earlier times or to incorporate appropriate interim sacrifices early in subsequent chronic toxicity/carcinogen- icity studies.",
            "If ovarian changes are anticipated in ad- vance, it is recommended that recovery groups be incorporated into the standard toxicity study.",
            "Histopathologic evaluation of the ovary is frequently frustrated by sampling limitations.",
            "Since the ovary is small, a typical single histologic section may not contain all tissue elements.",
            "Thus, assessment of the number of follicles or corpora lutea may be compromised.",
            "If ovar- ian changes are anticipated, serial sections from both ovaries would help ensure adequate amounts of tissue for examination.",
            "By observing similar changes in both ovaries, the conclusion that the effect is systemic will be supported.",
            "Such observations, combined with careful examination of other hormonally related tissues and the use of interim sacrifices and recovery studies, should provide appropriate material for a comprehensive histopathologic assessment of ovarian toxicity.",
            "The issue of combining tumors for purposes of as- sessing carcinogenicity is controversial.",
            "If the practice of combining related tumors is followed, it may be in- appropriate to combine some ovarian tumors.",
            "The NTP- recommended nomenclature for rodent ovarian neo- plasms is based on the cell of origin of the neoplasms.",
            "Tumors arising from diverse cells of origin should not be combined for purposes of assessing carcinogenicity."

            "Introduction",
            "Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide, and consumption of red and processed meat has been associated with increased risk of and mortality from this cancer.",
            "In particular, consumption of red meat and meat cooked at high temperature containing elevated levels of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) is associated with increased risk of colorectal adenoma.",
            "HCAs are mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds formed through pyrolysis of aromatic amino acids and creatinine in meats cooked at high temperature, particularly by pan-frying .",
            "Numerous studies in vitro, in animals, and in humans indicate that various dietary components, such as cruciferous vegetables, chlorophyllin (CHL), and fermented milk products, may modulate cancer risks associated with meat consumption in general and the mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of HCAs specifically.",
            "Although several small observational studies in humans reported protective effects of cruciferous vegetables against fried-meat-induced genotoxicity, epidemiologic studies did not.",
            "Glucosinolates and isothiocyanates in cruciferous vegetables inhibit HCA-induced genotoxicity by several mechanisms, including inhibition of phase I metabolizing enzymes, induction of phase II detoxification enzymes, and apoptosis .",
            "CHL, a copper salt derivative of chlorophyll, reduces the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of HCAs in vitro and in experimental animals; it also reduces the genotoxic effects of aflatoxin exposure in humans.",
            "CHL forms a molecular complex with planar carcinogens, thus inhibiting uptake in the intestine ; it also exhibits antioxidant activity and induces apoptosis.",
            "Animal studies and small controlled feeding studies in humans reported that lactobacilli in fermented milk and yogurt protect against HCA-induced genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.",
            "Lactobacilli from dietary sources may inhibit HCA-induced genotoxicity by binding mutagens to the bacterial cell wall or by altered metabolism of HCAs through changes in intestinal microflora.",
            "Previous controlled feeding studies in humans focused on changes in urinary mutagenicity after consumption of fried meat or inhibitors of fried meat-induced mutagenesis.",
            "Although urine mutagenicity can reflect systemic exposure to dietary mutagens and antimutagens, it does not measure the ability of fried meat to induce DNA damage in relevant cancer-target tissues, such as in colon epithelial cells, or the ability of putative dietary antimutagens and anticarcinogens to reduce such damage.",
            "To explore these issues, we used a crossover design and fed subjects diets containing meat fried at low or high temperature (Fig. 1) cooked as described by Sinha et al..",
            "Subjects were also fed diets prepared with meat fried at high temperature alone or in combination with three putative inhibitors of HCA-induced damage (cruciferous vegetables, chlorophyllin tablets, and yogurt), again in a crossover design.",
            "Based on the protocol of Peters et al., we evaluated the effects of the cooking methods and diets on meat and urinary mutagenicity using the Salmonella (Ames) mutagenicity assay, and we also extended this to fecal mutagenicity.",
            "To assess the effects of the diets on target and non-target tissue, we used the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay to measure DNA damage in epithelial cells isolated from rectal biopsies and from lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood.",
            "To our knowledge this is the first study in humans to combine measurements of fecal and urinary mutagenicity with assessment of DNA damage in the target tissue, colon epithelium, to evaluate the genotoxic effects of HCAs and inhibition of that genotoxicity by dietary factors, i.e., cruciferous vegetables, CHL, and yogurt.",
            "Results",
            "Subject recruitment",
            "Of the 70 individuals assessed for eligibility, 24 did not meet the inclusion criteria and 30 declined to participate.",
            "Individuals were excluded for weight (BMI>31), diet, age, underlying medical conditions, prescription medication use, or NSAID use.",
            "Subjects were recruited between April and August, 2004 and participated in the study in 4 groups of 4 between June and November, 2004.",
            "All 16 subjects enrolled in the study completed the study protocol and results were collected and analyzed for all subjects.",
            "Mutagenicity of meat extracts",
            "Before the feeding study, we evaluated mutagenicity in a variety of meats cooked at high and low temperature; results of this pilot study (Table 1) were consistent with previous reports, .",
            "The extract from beef cooked at low temperature was not mutagenic and had non-detectable levels of HCAs.",
            "In contrast, the extract from beef cooked at high temperature had high levels of HCAs, with PhIP (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) being predominant, and the extract was mutagenic, exhibiting an \u223c10-fold higher mutagenic potency in strain YG1024 compared to strain TA98.",
            "The results with sausage were similar to those with high-temperature beef, and extracts from both meats were less mutagenic in YG1041 compared to YG1024.",
            "The extract from high-temperature bacon had extremely high levels of HCAs and mutagenicity and was 4.5 and 7 times more mutagenic in YG1041 and YG1024, respectively, than in TA98.",
            "Although the extract of beef was similarly mutagenic in YG1024 and YG1041, the presence of nitroreductase in YG1041 clearly reduced the mutagenicity of extracts from sausage and bacon, which likely contained nitrites that helped to form nitroarenes that were converted to aromatic amines by nitroreductase in YG1041.",
            "The potentially high nitrite levels in bacon may account for the extremely high levels of mutagenicity of bacon extracts in all three strains.",
            "Because of the potential contribution of nitrites along with HCAs with the bacon, we decided not to include bacon in the feeding study so that we were examining the effect of primarily HCAs.",
            "Mean levels of HCAs and mutagenicity of extracts from 4 batches of high-temperature beef and sausage prepared throughout the feeding study (Table 2) were consistent with those from the pilot, with PhIP being the predominant HCA and both extracts exhibiting similar levels of mutagenic activity, \u223c10,000 rev/g in YG1024.",
            "Urinary mutagenicity",
            "The estimated mutagenic potencies of extracts from un-hydrolyzed and hydrolyzed urine from 8 subjects depended on whether they consumed meals prepared with meat cooked at low or high temperature (Fig. 2A).",
            "Urinary mutagenicity in un-hydrolyzed samples increased nearly 3-fold (P\u200a=\u200a0.06), from 2.3 to 6.8 rev/\u00b5mol creatinine, respectively, from low- to high-temperature meat diets.",
            "The mutagenic potency of extracts from hydrolyzed urine increased significantly (P\u200a=\u200a0.0005) from 7.2 to 39.6 rev/\u00b5mol creatinine, respectively, from low- to high-temperature meat diets.",
            "These results were consistent with the high levels of HCAs measured in high-temperature meat.",
            "For the 8 subjects consuming diets containing high-temperature meat alone or in combination with the dietary inhibitors, the mutagenic potency of extracts from un-hydrolyzed urine decreased slightly when subjects consumed the inhibitors (Fig. 2B).",
            "In contrast, the mutagenic potency of extracts from hydrolyzed urine increased nearly 2-fold, from 36.5 to 63.8 rev/\u00b5mol creatinine, respectively, with the addition of inhibitors to the high-temperature meat diet (P\u200a=\u200a0.03).",
            "Fecal mutagenicity",
            "The % extractable organic matter (EOM) \u00b1 SD for the feces was 8.4\u00b11.7 for un-hydrolyzed, 8.7\u00b11.9 for hydrolyzed, and 8.6\u00b11.8 for the two combined.",
            "We saw no difference in fecal mutagenicity in extracts from un-hydrolyzed feces between low- and high-temperature meat diets (Fig. 2C).",
            "In contrast, extracts of hydrolyzed feces from subjects eating the high-temperature meat diet were significantly more mutagenic (P<0.0001) than those from subjects eating the low-temperature meat diet, being, respectively, 33.3 versus 10.1 rev/mg of lyophilized feces.",
            "Adding inhibitors to the high-temperature meat diet decreased the mutagenic potencies of extracts compared to the diet without inhibitors (Fig. 2D) from 12.3 to 4.9 rev/mg of lyophilized feces for un-hydrolyzed feces (P\u200a=\u200a0.006) and from 40.8 to 29.3 rev/mg of lyophilized feces for hydrolyzed feces (P\u200a=\u200a0.019).",
            "DNA damage in colon cells and WBCs",
            "The mean comet-assay Tail Moment (TM) of colon cells was 7.2 with low- and 8.9 with high-temperature meat, but the increase was not statistically significant (P\u200a=\u200a0.19) (Fig. 2E\u2013F).",
            "When subjects consumed dietary inhibitors along with the high-temperature meat, DNA damage in colon cells was reduced significantly by nearly half, from a mean TM of 5.8 without inhibitors to 3.2 with inhibitors (P\u200a=\u200a0.02).",
            "We saw no differences among diets for DNA damage in WBCs (Fig. 2E\u2013F).",
            "Discussion",
            "HCAs and mutagenicity of meat extracts",
            "In our study, high-temperature beef and sausage had HCA levels (Table 2) comparable to those of Sinha et al. who reported concentrations of 9, 2.1, and 32.8 ng/g of meat for MeIQ (2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline), DiMeIQx (2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline), and PhIP, respectively.",
            "For the predominant HCA, PhIP, our subjects received \u223c4 g of meat/kg/day\u00d750.3 ng of PhIP/g of meat\u200a=\u200a201.2 ng of PhIP/kg/day, corresponding to 118 ng/kg/day in Sinha et al..",
            "Based on the mutagenicity of high-temperature beef and sausage in strain TA98 from our pilot study (Table 1), our subjects received \u223c1000 rev/g of meat\u00d7\u223c4 g/kg/day\u200a=\u200a4000 rev/kg/day.",
            "Our subjects averaged 86 kg in weight, so a typical subject had an intake of \u223c344,000 rev/day from high-temperature meat; Peters et al. reported 253,700 rev/day in a study with a similar protocol.",
            "Extracts from fried beef and sausage were 10 times more mutagenic in YG1024 than in TA98 (Table 1), confirming a previous study, and was likely due to activation of HCAs by acetyltransferase in YG1024.",
            "When based instead on meat-derived mutagenicity measured in strain YG1024, our subjects had an intake of \u223c3,440,000 rev/day.",
            "Effect of fried meat on urinary and fecal mutagenicity",
            "By design this was not a metabolic study; nevertheless, we constructed approximations to a typical subject's output of mutagenicity (Table 3).",
            "Because our samples include only a portion of the urine or feces eliminated by a subject on a given day, our approximations likely underestimate output.",
            "The increase in HCAs in the meat was associated with a concomitant increase in urinary mutagenicity from low- to high-temperature meat diets, corroborating a previous finding  (Table 3).",
            "Unlike the previous study, we used the same strain of Salmonella (YG1024) to measure the input of meat-derived mutagenicity and the output of urinary (and fecal) mutagenicity.",
            "Our approximations indicate that subjects on the high-temperature meat diet excreted 3 and 16% of \u223c3,440,000 rev/day intake as unhydrolyzed and hydrolyzed urinary mutagenicity, respectively (Table 3).",
            "Hydrolyzed urinary mutagenicity reflects both the un-conjugated and formerly conjugated mutagenic activity.",
            "One study, however, showed an association between risk for colorectal adenomas and unhydrolyzed urinary mutagenicity.",
            "Interestingly, the diet with inhibitors reduced the excretion of unhydrolyzed urinary mutagenicity by 36% (Table 3) compared to the same diet without them, suggesting that inhibitors reduced the systemic genotoxic exposure (i.e., unhydrolyzed urinary mutagenicity) associated with risk for colorectal adenoma.",
            "The approximations in Table 3 indicate that without inhibitors, \u223c38% of the meat-derived mutagenic intake was excreted (hydrolyzed fecal and urinary mutagenicity combined), i.e., 509,000+787,000\u200a=\u200a1,296,000 rev/day excreted versus 3,440,000 rev/day consumed; with inhibitors present, this value was \u223c42%.",
            "We suspect that additional mutagenic activity would have been revealed by capturing all urine and feces excreted and by fractionating the feces.",
            "There are several classes of fecal mutagens, and some, such as the fecapentanes, were not necessarily measured in our study because they are primarily direct-acting, base-substitution mutagens, and we used a frameshift strain with S9 mix.",
            "Consumption of meat fried at high temperature increased levels of hydrolyzed fecal mutagenicity, consistent with a previous study showing that consumption of fried meat increased fecal mutagenicity in humans.",
            "Also, fried-meat mutagens in feces were in primarily a conjugated (or bound) form.",
            "HCAs bind to intestinal bacteria in vitro , and dietary fiber (non-starch polysaccharides) reduces HCA bioavailability in vivo .",
            "Thus, meat-derived HCAs may have been bound to dietary fiber and normal gut flora, and their mutagenicity was revealed only when they were released by acid hydrolysis.",
            "Because the total dietary fiber content was approximately 38% greater with inhibitors than without them, we cannot rule out a protective role for fiber in the inhibitor diet.",
            "Effect of inhibitors on urinary and fecal mutagenicity",
            "Although the diet containing inhibitors produced a non-significant decrease in un-hydrolyzed urinary mutagenicity, it increased hydrolyzed urinary mutagenicity nearly 2-fold (Fig. 2B).",
            "This increase was likely due to enhanced conjugation, possibly by components of the crucifera.",
            "Cruciferous vegetables induced the phase II enzyme NAD(P)H quinone reductase in vitro , induced UDP-glucuronosyl transferase in rats, and increased glutathione-S-transferase-\u03b1 levels in human plasma and colon epithelium.",
            "The decrease in both hydrolyzed and un-hydrolyzed fecal mutagenicity by the inhibitor diet (Fig. 2, Table 3) is consistent with the binding of HCAs to CHL or to the cell walls of lactobacilli.",
            "CHL forms molecular complexes with planar mutagens, such as aflatoxin and HCAs, and it reduces the mutagenicity of these compounds in Salmonella and the uptake of these compounds in trout and rats.",
            "Studies in rats suggest a combined effect of reduced mutagen uptake and increased conjugation by Phase II enzymes.",
            "HCAs can bind to the cell walls of lactobacilli in vitro, decreasing mutagenesis.",
            "Lactobacilli also exhibit protective effects in rodent and human studies, with possible mechanisms including antioxidant activity as well as effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis.",
            "As noted earlier, the greater fiber content of our inhibitor diet may account for some of the altered urinary and fecal mutagenicity, as well as reduced DNA damage in colorectal cells, produced by the inhibitor diet.",
            "DNA damage in WBCs and rectal cells",
            "Vegetable juices reduced DNA damage in lymphocytes in some human dietary intervention studies; however, we observed no effects of diet on DNA damage in WBCs, although our diets did not involve vegetable juices.",
            "In contrast, we found that diet altered DNA damage levels in rectal cells (Fig. 2E\u2013F).",
            "Kiss et al.  showed that a fried-meat diet increased DNA damage in exfoliated colorectal mucosal cells compared to a vegetarian diet, particularly among subjects with GSTM1-null or NAT2-rapid genotypes.",
            "In rats, diets containing cooked beef or chicken increased DNA single- or double-strand breaks in colonocytes, but dietary fiber (high-amylose maize starch) inhibited such damage.",
            "Other animal studies demonstrated the inhibition of HCA- or fried meat-induced DNA damage by lactobacilli and by cruciferous vegetables and their constituents.",
            "Given that both CHL and compounds in cruciferous vegetables induced apoptosis in vitro , we cannot rule out apoptosis as a mechanism for decreased DNA damage with the inhibitor diet.",
            "To our knowledge, this study is the first in humans to demonstrate that dietary factors can protect rectal cells from DNA damage induced by mutagens, such as those in fried meat.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Our study is limited by the small number of subjects (n\u200a=\u200a16).",
            "In addition, we did not monitor changes in blood or urine levels of isothiocyanates or other components of cruciferous vegetables, CHL or chlorins, HCA-glucuronides in urine, or whether diets with lactobacilli altered the flora in fecal samples.",
            "The study design, i.e., testing the effects of the three putative inhibitors together rather than testing each inhibitor separately, prevents conclusions about the relative importance of the three inhibitors and about their mechanism of DNA-damage inhibition.",
            "For example, we could not evaluate the possible interaction between the putative inhibitors, assessing whether their protective mechanisms may have been synergistic or antagonistic with each other.",
            "Future studies are warranted to study the protective mechanisms of each dietary inhibitor, cruciferous vegetables, chlorophyllin, and yogurt alone against HCA-induced genotoxicity.",
            "Although our study was not designed to examine differences between women and men in the responses that we measured, a study designed to confirm whether or not such differences exist is needed.",
            "Given the few subjects and short-term dietary regimens, our results must be interpreted with caution.",
            "Nevertheless, they indicate that meat cooked at high temperature increased mutagenicity in urine and feces and that consumption of yogurt, cruciferous vegetables, and CHL altered urinary and fecal mutagenicity and reduced colorectal cell DNA damage.",
            "Although increased urinary mutagenicity following consumption of highly fried meat is well established, our study is the first to concurrently measure both fecal mutagenicity and DNA damage in colon epithelium and to demonstrate that dietary antimutagens can alter these characteristics.",
            "Materials and Methods",
            "Study population and design",
            "The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1.",
            "We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 16 healthy volunteers (8 men and 8 women) recruited by local advertisement from the Chapel Hill, NC area.",
            "Subjects were non-smokers, aged 18\u201345 (mean 29.5 y), had a body mass index <30, and were not currently taking prescription medications or antibiotics.",
            "Individuals were excluded if they consumed >2 alcoholic drinks/day, were vegetarians, or had a history of diabetes, goiter, colitis, a diagnosed thyroid condition, or occult bleeding.",
            "Following a telephone interview to determine eligibility, we invited individuals for a second interview.",
            "At this time, we described the study, asked about dietary preferences, and administered a brief questionnaire on medical and diet history (including meat intake).",
            "Initial screening measurements for each subject included blood pressure, body temperature, and respiration rate.",
            "We recorded height and weight for diet calculations, instructed subjects to eat only the food provided by the CTRC, and prohibited use of aspirin, vitamins, and herbal supplements during the study.",
            "The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and by human studies approving officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.",
            "All subjects provided written informed consent.",
            "This study had two arms, each a cross-over design (Fig. 1) that used 8 subjects (4 men and 4 women).",
            "For each arm, 2 men and 2 women were assigned randomly to a dietary sequence consisting of 2 weeks on one defined diet followed by two weeks on another; the remaining 4 subjects were assigned the same two diets in reverse order.",
            "In arm 1 (Fig. 1), one diet included beef and sausage cooked at low temperature (100\u00b0C); the other diet included the same meat cooked at high temperature (250\u00b0C).",
            "Both contained non-cruciferous vegetables.",

            "Let  denote the expected (mean) number of mutant colonies at dose d.",
            "For estimating mutagenic potency based on a single assay, we modeled the expected counts as a linear function of dose, namely,  where , the expected count at dose 0, reflects the background mutant yield in the Salmonella strain used in the assay and , the slope, is the mutagenic potency.",
            "We regarded plate counts as Poisson distributed but allowed for over-dispersion among plates within an assay.",

            "For estimating mutagenic potency when multiple specimens or multiple assays per specimen contributed to a common average mutagenic potency, we used closely related but more elaborate models that reflected sources of variation in the data and assumptions about assay properties.",
            "If we assayed multiple specimens (from the same or different treatments) on the same day, their assays all shared the same dose 0 plate(s), reflecting that the background mutant yield is regarded as the same for all specimens on a given day; however, separate dose 0 plates were run on different days, reflecting that uncontrolled day-to- day fluctuations in the laboratory environment could induce minor day-to-day disturbances in the background mutant yield.",
            "Similarly, we expected mutagenic potency to vary slightly from assay to assay if, for example, a given specimen was assayed on multiple days or if different specimens representing a given treatment were assayed on the same day.",
            "To reflect such sources of extra-Poisson variation, we used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs).",

            "For crossover designs, we also considered carryover from the diet given in one period onto the diet given in the following period to influence slopes.",
            "Because specimen-to-specimen or assay-to-assay variation in mutagenic potency tends to be larger for treatments with higher mutagenic potency, our models incorporated heterogeneity of variances across treatments for certain random effects.",
            "To choose a parsimonious specification for modeling the random effects in a GLMM, we used BIC, a widely used model-selection criterion.",

            "The target group comprises all workers with more than 5 years exposure to cadmium at any time since the factories started production.",
            "An internal reference group of 328 alloy factory workers without cadmium exposure was also studied.",
            "The expected number of deaths and cancers was calculated with the \"life-table\" method by using national average incidence rates for men in different age groups and at different calendar years.",
            "It was found that among the workers in the battery factory who started work before 1948 there was an increased general mortality in the 1950's mainly due to respiratory disease.",
            "The same group had an increased renal disease mortality.",
            "There was no increase in general cancer mortality or in general cancer incidence.",
            "The risk ratio for nasopharyngeal cancer incidence was 10 (two cases), which was statistically significant.",
            "For some other sites like prostate, lung and colon-rectum the risk ratios were also greater than 1 but not statistically significant.",
            "In the alloy factory there was a tendency for an increased mortality in prostatic cancer (four cases).",
            "After correction for the \"healthy worker effect\" using the reference group, the risk ratio for prostatic cancer deaths was calculated as 2.4, but this was not statistically significant.",
            "The findings in this study support the earlier reports of an association between human cadmium exposure and increased risk for prostatic cancer.",
            "Introduction",
            "Follow-up studies of workers with excessive cadmium exposure have found several cases that died of emphysema (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6).",
            "Apart from the calcula- tions by Friberg and Kjellstrom in the review by Friberg et al., (7) no quantitative estimates of excess mortality among ca'dmium workers have been published.",
            "Cancer is of particular interest when discussing the long-term prognosis after cadmium exposure.",
            "Data are accumulating from both animals and hu- mans linking cancer and cadmium exposure.",
            "Since Haddow et al. (8,9) showed that subcutaneous in- jections of large doses of cadmium compounds in rats could cause sarcomata at the site of injection, a number of studies of rats and mice have confirmed (14).",
            "The doses necessary to induce cancer have usually been so large that testicular damage also occurred (18).",
            "In some studies tumors were also found in the testes (10, 11, 17).",
            "No conclusive data have been published regard- ing cadmium induction of cancer in human beings.",
            "In 1965 Potts (/9) noticed that an unusually high proportion of a group of cadmium battery workers had died of cancer.",
            "The numbers were small and no reference group was studied.",
            "Kipling and Water- house (20) reported that among 248 workers with a minimum of one year's exposure to cadmium oxide the expected number of prostatic cancers was 0.58, and 4 were observed.",
            "The expected number was calculated based on the rates in the Birmingham regional cancer register.",
            "A similar type of study was performed on 272 cadmium smelter workers in the USA (21).",
            "The average cancer mortality rates for the whole of USA was used to calculate expected numbers.",
            "For all cancers the SMR was 154 (p < 0.05) and for respiratory cancer SMR was 235 (p < 0.05).",
            "The highest SMR was found for prostatic cancer (SMR = 347, p < 0.05), (1.15 cases expected, 4 cases observed).",
            "This would support the finding by Kipling and Waterhouse.",
            "However, a long-term injection study of rats (22) could not show any tumors in the prostate.",
            "The objective of this study was to measure the cause-specific mortality and incidence of cancer in two groups of Swedish workers exposed to cadmium and compare these data with reference data.",
            "Materials and Methods",
            "The target groups comprised all workers with a 5 years or longer exposure to cadmium in two Swedish factories.",
            "One of the factories was the cadmium-nickel battery factory which has been studied several times since 1950 (23)(24)(25).",
            "The workers have been exposed to cadmium oxide dust and nickel hydroxide dust.",
            "Before 1947 the cadmium exposure levels were on an average above 1 mg Cd/i3 in air (23).",
            "In the 1950's the levels were ap- proximately 200 ,ug Cd/i3, and between 1962 and 1974 they were about 50,g Cd/i3 (25).",
            "Since then they have decreased further, and most of the workers are now exposed to levels below 5,g Cd/i3 (26).",
            "According to measurements in the 1950's (23) and in the early 1970's (25), the nickel hydroxide exposure levels have been at least the same as the cadmium exposure levels and often up to 10 times as high.",
            "The other factory is a copper-cadmium alloy smelter in which the workers at the furnace have been exposed to cadmium oxide fumes.",
            "The production of copper-cadmium alloys started in the 1930's, but reliable measurements of the cadmium exposure via air was first carried out in the middle of the 1960's.",
            "The cadmium concentrations were then in the range 100-400 ,ig Cd/i3 (27).",
            "In 1971, local exhaust equipment was installed in the furnace area, and since then the average exposure level has been about 50 Ag Cd/i3.",
            "It should be pointed out that in this factory the workers were exposed to cadmium oxide fumes and in the other factory to a mixture of cadmium oxide and nickel hydroxide dust.",
            "An internal reference group was used in the alloy factory, comprising all other workers in the same factory who had been employed for at least 5 years and never exposed to cadmium in the factory.",
            "These workers were involved in the production of copper and brass tubes as well as various aluminum products.",
            "From company records, lists of all workers who belonged to the target groups were produced.",
            "The data include name, birth date (if available), most recently known address, sex, death date (if avail-able), and exposure and employment experience in this particular company.",
            "In the battery factory such records were kept for all years after 1945, and the target group could thus only include those workers who were employed in the factory in 1945 or who started working after that date.",
            "In the alloy factory the records went as far back as 1940, which means that the target group was limited to those workers who were employed in 1940 or who started working after that.",

            "In those cases where no birth dates had been found in the company records these could be found in the county offices in most cases.",
            "For most of the cases that had died the death date was also recorded from the county office record.",
            "The county office could also tell us whether this person was still living in the same county; in those cases where the person had moved outside the county, a further check with the next county to which he moved was carried out.",
            "In a few cases the personal numbers could not be found in the county office and a check was carried out with the local parish office (which in Sweden is similar to the of- fice of the registrar of births, deaths, and mar- riages), and usually it was found that in these cases the person had moved long ago to another county.",
            "Further follow-ups were carried out, and eventually complete data about birth and death dates were collected, except for the few workers who had moved abroad.",
            "For the cases that had died we asked the parish office to send us a copy of the death record where the cause of death is recorded.",

            "They were born between 1874 and 1952.",
            "Nine of them started working before 1920, 34 started in the 20's, 40 started in the 30's, 103 started in the 40's, 40 started in the 50's and 43 started in the 60's.",
            "There was a total of 43 deaths between 1949 and 1975, and 15 new cases of cancers between 1959 and 1975.",
            "Eight of the deaths were caused by cancer.",
            "There were 19 deaths by cardiovascular diseases, 8 by respiratory diseases, 5 by kidney diseases, and 3 by other diseases.",
            "Calculations of expected and observed deaths based on groups with different years of start of work, different time since first exposure, different duration of exposure, or different calendar years for the death, mostly show lower observed numbers than expected numbers.",
            "For instance, for the whole group of workers with exposure duration between 5 and 14 years, the cumulative expected number of deaths between 1945 and 1975 was 20, and the cumulative observed number was only 15.",
            "For those with cadmium exposure duration between 15  and 24 years the cumulative numbers were 14 ex- pected and 9 observed.",
            "For those with exposure durations between 25 and 34 years, the expected number was 16 and the observed 9, and for those with exposure duration of 35 to 51 years, there was 17 expected cases and only 10 observed.",
            "On the other hand, when certain small groups are looked at, the number of total deaths tends to be higher, especially in the 1950's.",
            "For these that started work between 1913 and 1929 there were four observed deaths in 1950 and 1954 as compared to 2.22 ex- pected deaths (p -0.18); for those starting in 1930-39, there were two deaths in the same period as compared to an expected 0.49 deaths (p -0.08).",
            "Further, the group of 19 workers with the highest exposure level and worst clinical condition studied by Friberg (23) had a much greater mortality experience in the 1950's than expected (Fig. 1).",
            "In order to take into consideration the great changes in exposure level that has occurred in the battery factory during the years, the workers were divided into those who started work in 1947 or be- fore, 1948 to 1961, and 1962 and after.",
            "For the first group with the highest exposure levels, there was generally a higher total number of expected deaths than the observed number (Fig. 2), except for the 1950's where the \"bump\" indicates that an over- mortality occurred.",
            "In most of the time periods, 1945 to 1974, the numbers of cancer and cardiovascular disease deaths are lower than the expected (Fig. 2).",

            "In Figure 3 the mortality risk ratio based on the cumulative ob- served and expected numbers of respiratory and kidney disease deaths have been plotted.",
            "It is seen that the ratios are often much higher than 1.",

            "Those workers who died during the period 1959-1975 have been excluded from the calculation from the year of death.",
            "There were no cases of kidney or pancreas cancer among these workers.",
            "There was a tendency for an increased incidence of prostatic, lung and colorectal cancer among these workers, but these risk ratios were not statistically significantly higher than 1.",
            "For nasopharyngeal cancer, however, the risk ratio of 10 was statistically significant (p S 0.05).",
            "In the group of other cancers, the observed number tended to be lower than the expected, and the total incidence of cancer was more or less the same in this group as had been expected from the national average.",
            "Both the prostatic cancers occurred in the group that started work before 1948, and for that group the risk ratio of cumulative number of cases between 1959 and 1975 was 2.3 (p -0.25).",
            "Also all the five colorectal cancers occurred in this group, and the risk ratio for that particular group was 3.1 (p - 0.05).",
            "One nasopharyngeal cancer occurred in the group that started before 1948 and one occurred in the group 1948 to 1961.",
            "Because of the way that data on incident cases of cancer has been collected, there may have been cancers occurring in the 1950's that have not been picked up.",
            "A calculation of the number of years since start of exposure when the cancer cases occur may therefore be biased.",
            "However, from our data it can be calculated that the first case of prostatic cancer occurred 26 years after start of exposure and for the lung cancer, the colorectal cancer, the nasopharyngeal cancer, and other cancers, the equivalent latency times were 25, 13, 10, and 15 years.",
            "Alloy Factory",
            "For this factory only a preliminary calculation of prostatic cancer mortality has been carried out.",
            "More detailed calculations will be made when all the data for the target groups are known.",
            "It is unlikely, however, that the \"missing\" persons would have a different mortality experience than those included here.",
            "In both the exposed and reference groups there were four observed cases of prostatic cancer deaths (Table 2), but the expected number differed.",
            "The lower than expected mortality in the reference group would constitute the \"healthy worker effect\" (28).",
            "The p values denote the probability that the true risk ratios are 1.",
            "The healthy worker effect can be corrected for by dividing the risk ratio for the exposed group by the ratio for the reference group or by adjusting the expected number in the exposed group (2.69) to 0.62 x 2.69 = 1.67.",
            "If it is assumed that the same healthy worker effect applies to the prostatic cancer inci- dence of the battery factory workers their risk ratio would be 2.7 (1.67/0.62).",
            "Discussion",
            "In view of the well known effects of inhaled cad- mium on the lungs and the kidneys (7, 23), it is not surprising that there was an increased mortality in respiratory and renal disease.",
            "The over-mortality was most pronounced in the group with the highest cadmium oxide dust exposure, but due to the lim- ited number of workers studied a detailed dose- response relationship could not be evaluated.",
            "When the healthy worker effect is accounted for (Fig. 2), it is clear that heavy cadmium exposure can decrease the life expectancy.",
            "This was most clearly shown in the group of 19 workers with the highest exposure (Fig. 1).",
            "The cancer incidence data in this study corre- spond very well with earlier studies (19, 20), of cadmium-exposed battery factory workers.",
            "Also in those studies there was no increase in total cancer incidence but at the same time there was a tendency for an increase of prostatic cancer incidence.",
            "The risk ratio in one of the studies (20) was similar to our finding, but no quantitative comparisons of risk ratios between studies can easily be made, because the risk ratio may be a function of age, exposure intensity, exposure duration and latency times.",
            "Kolonel (29) claims that there is a significant as- sociation of renal cancer with exposure to cad- mium.",
            "Among the battery factory workers in our study no renal cancers were found.",
            "The cadmium exposure estimates in Kolonel's study were not based on individual direct measurements of cadmium exposure but on circumstantial data like past occupation (e.g. electroplating, alloy-making, welding, manufacture of storage batteries), diet history, and smoking habits.",
            "The calculated estimates of mean daily dietary cadmium intake in different groups (including reference groups) varied between 122 and 137 ug, which is 5 to 6 times the estimates based on direct measurement (31).",
            "Also, in the cadmium alloy factory group we found a tendency for an increased prostatic cancer mortality.",
            "Lemen et al. (21) reported an increase in prostatic cancer mortality in a cadmium smelter.",
            "It is unlikely that all these observations of increased prostatic cancer incidence or mortality among cad- mium exposed workers in different exposure situa- tions are purely coincidental.",
            "Further epidemiological studies of this relationship as well as studies of possible mechanisms for cadmium carcinogenicity are needed.",
            "The high risk ratio for nasopharyngeal cancer among the battery workers is another observation February 1979 a \"Healthy worker effect,\" corrected risk ratio = 1.49/0.62 = 2.4 (p = 0.087).",

            "Large amounts of cadmium particles may be deposited in the nose when the exposure level is high.",
            "The retired workers from the battery factory have told us how their noses used to be completely blocked up with dust from the factory (in the 1940's) and that it used to take several days in fresh air before all the dust was out.",
            "Anosmia used to be considered a symptom of cadmium poisoning (7) and this could also be related to the very high exposure levels.",
            "As early as 1932, Grenfell and Samuel (31) reported an unusually high occurrence of cancer in the nasal cavity among nickel smelter workers.",

            "Background",
            "The toxic and inflammatory potential of 5 different types of nanoparticles were studied in a sensitive model for pulmonary effects in apolipoprotein E knockout mice (ApoE-/-).",
            "We studied the effects instillation or inhalation Printex 90 of carbon black (CB) and compared CB instillation in ApoE-/- and C57 mice.",
            "Three and 24 h after pulmonary exposure, inflammation was assessed by mRNA levels of cytokines in lung tissue, cell composition, genotoxicity, protein and lactate dehydrogenase activity in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid.",
            "Results",
            "Firstly, we found that intratracheal instillation of CB caused far more pulmonary toxicity in ApoE-/- mice than in C57 mice.",
            "Secondly, we showed that instillation of CB was more toxic than inhalation of a presumed similar dose with respect to inflammation in the lungs of ApoE-/- mice.",
            "Thirdly, we compared effects of instillation in ApoE-/- mice of three carbonaceous particles; CB, fullerenes C60 (C60) and single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) as well as gold particles and quantum dots (QDs).",
            "Characterization of the instillation media revealed that all particles were delivered as agglomerates and aggregates.",
            "Significant increases in Il-6, Mip-2 and Mcp-1 mRNA were detected in lung tissue, 3 h and 24 h following instillation of SWCNT, CB and QDs.",
            "DNA damage in BAL cells, the fraction of neutrophils in BAL cells and protein in BAL fluid increased statistically significantly.",
            "Gold and C60 particles caused much weaker inflammatory responses.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Our data suggest that ApoE-/- model is sensitive for evaluating particle induced inflammation.",
            "Overall QDs had greatest effects followed by CB and SWCNT with C60 and gold being least inflammatory and DNA-damaging.",
            "However the gold was used at a much lower mass dose than the other particles.",
            "The strong effects of QDs were likely due to Cd release.",
            "The surface area of the instilled dose correlated well the inflammatory response for low toxicity particles.",
            "Background",
            "Human beings have always been exposed to airborne ultrafine particles (i.e. particles below 100 nm size) from e.g., forest fires, volcanic eruptions or indoor fire places.",
            "However, since the industrial revolution, exposures to ultrafine particles have increased dramatically.",
            "This is mainly due to the invention of the combustion engines.",
            "Engineered nanomaterials and nanotechnologies are expected to have a profound impact on many aspects of society and economy.",
            "However, they also represent a new source of human exposures and awareness is growing that their unusual chemical and physical properties may lead to potential environmental and health risks.",
            "The toxicity and carcinogenicity of low-soluble particles is thought to be exerted primarily through generation of inflammation and oxidative stress.",
            "Pulmonary inflammation is central in lung diseases and also thought to be involved in risk of atherothrombosis.",
            "Concern has been raised over nano-sized particles because the bronchio-alveolar deposition rate is great, they have a large surface area, are more reactive, and the clearance of them is slow.",
            "All these factors may contribute to more severe and prolonged inflammation and, consequently, increased risk for disease.",
            "Although it has been estimated that less than 1% of the deposited dose translocates from the lung into the circulation, this is suspected to be important in nanoparticle-induced cardiovascular effects, and may also produce adverse hepatic, developmental effects and other effects in organs remote from the lung.",
            "Although many laboratories are currently investigating toxicological effects of nano-sized materials, few in vivo studies have been published in the field on nanotoxicology and only with a very limited panels of nanomaterials in the same experimental setup.",
            "For an in vivo comparison study of toxicity we chose a panel of nanoparticles with carbon black, Printex 90 (CB), single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), fullerenes C60 (C60), quantum dots (QDs) and nanosized gold particles.",
            "CB is a well-known ingredient in rubber, plastics, inks, and paints with an annual production about 10 million tonnes.",
            "The toxic effects of CB have been well described in vitro and in vivo, making it an excellent benchmark material.",
            "SWCNT and C60 have the potential to be among the most widely used carbonaceous engineered nanomaterials in the future.",
            "Material scientists have envisioned the use of these type of particles in wide range of applications (e.g., composite materials, disease treatment and electronics).",
            "QDs are currently applied in biomedical imaging and electronics, but have been suggested for use in computer memories, visual displays, solar cells and lasers as well as a replacement for organic dyes due to superior quantum yield and resistance to photo bleaching.",
            "Both QDs and gold particles additionally have properties which make them detectable in translocation and targeting studies.",
            "The overall goal of this study was to test an expected susceptible animal model (apolipoprotein E knockout mouse, ApoE-/-) as well as background strain (C57) for direct comparison of markers of inflammation, lung injury and genotoxicity in lung tissue and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid following pulmonary exposure across the panel of nanoparticles.",
            "The ApoE-/- mice were chosen since these experiments were part of a larger study which also includes cardiovascular research.",
            "However, these animals have previously shown increased permeability of particulates in blood vessels.",
            "If this permeability is related to the modest elevated blood cholesterol found in ApoE-/- mice, the model may closer resemble humans with elevated cholesterol levels.",
            "Experiments showed that the most sensitive of the tested exposure methods was a combination of intratracheal (i.t.) instillation of nanoparticles in apolipoprotein E knockout mice (ApoE-/-).",
            "The chosen inflammatory markers were mRNA levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (Mip-2), interleukin-6 (Il-6) and macrophages/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1) in lung tissue and BAL cell composition.",
            "MIP-2 is involved in the chemotactic recruitment of neutrophils to the pulmonary system following exposure.",
            "MCP-1 is produced by numerous inflammatory cells including epithelium fibroblasts, monocytes and macrophages and is believed to promote the maturation of monocytes to macrophages as well as being a major chemoattractant for monocyte recruitment.",
            "Il-6 is an important early mediator of inflammation, involved in fever and acute phase responses.",
            "It is secreted mainly by macrophages e.g. as a response in particle induced inflammation.",
            "We have reported before that all of these markers are elevated at 24 h after inhalation of diesel particles.",
            "Additionally, we determined DNA damage in BAL cells by the comet assay as a sensitive marker for particle genotoxicity related mainly to oxidative stress and cellular damage by leakage of protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to the BAL fluid.",

            "By volume the size distribution was dominated by coarser particles in the range of 0.5\u20133 \u03bcm, which we interpreted to be cell-fragments derived from the BAL-fluid (Fig. 1A).",
            "The cell-fragments could be disturbing factor in some of the unfiltered analysis with small particle sizes.",

            "It has been shown previously that the inflammatory response of low toxicity-low solubility particles is proportional to the surface area of the instilled particles rather than the mass.",
            "We have previously determined surface area of SWCNT, CB and C60 by the BET N2 adsorption method to be 731, 338 and <20 m2/g, indicating that we have instilled 395, 183 and 11 cm2 of these three particles, respectively.",
            "The BET surface area of the C60 sample has since been corrected to 0.4 m2/g using a custom made single point BET modified for low surface areas (Personal communication Giulio Pojana) indicating that we have instilled 0.2 cm2.",
            "We also calculated the surface area of the instilled gold to be 0.85 cm2.",
            "The relationship between the surface area of the three carbonaceous particles (also 18 \u03bcg CB at 24 h), gold and controls and induction of cytokine mRNA and increased neutrophil fraction is illustrated in Figure 3.",
            "There was a good correlation between mRNA induction and fraction neutrophils at 3 h and the surface area instilled (r2 between 0.84 and 1).",
            "However, the mRNA levels decreased between 3 h and 24 h after SWCNT instillation and there was a smaller fraction of neutrophils compared to CB instilled mice.",
            "Thus, SWCNT was less inflammatory following 24 h than anticipated from surface area alone.",
            "This means that r2-values were below 0.60 for all inflammatory end-points.",
            "It should be noted that nanoparticles were delivered as agglomerates and the factual instilled surface area may therefore be lower than estimated from BET.",
            "But that it has also been suggested that action of surfactants and proteins in the lung may reduce van der Waals interactions between nanoparticles and disperse these agglomerates.",
            "Recently, it was suggested that there is threshold for inflammatory effects of low-toxicity, low-solubility particles at 1 cm2 deposited particle surface area/cm2 epithelial surface in the proximal alveolar region of the lung.",
            "If the particle burden within a day is concentrated to the proximal alveolar region, the effect on interleukin expression after 24 h (but not after 3 h) might be interpreted as a threshold at between 1 and 30 cm2 particle surface area per mouse (figure 3D).",
            "If we assume that the mice had lung has a epithelial surface area of about 600 cm2 and 5% of this was in the proximal alveolar region figure 3D might be interpreted as showing a threshold between 0,03 and 1 cm2 deposited particle surface area/cm2 epithelial surface area in the proximal alveoli, which would be in concordance with the theory of Donaldson et al.",
            "However, more data are needed to confirm this.",
            "Numerous physicochemical parameters have been suggested to influence the inflammatory effects nanoparticles, including agglomeration state, shape, composition, surface reactivity, radical formation capacity and more.",
            "SWCNT have a needle like shape and strong tendency to agglomerate.",
            "These parameters may distinguish SWCNT from C60 and CB and provide a possible explanation for the detected differences following 24 h.",
            "On the other hand, we have also previously found that the CB employed here caused more reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation than the SWCNT in cellular and cell-free system, whereas C60 generated far less ROS than the other particles.",
            "Additionally, recent evidence may suggest that SWCNT produces long term toxicity and may be different from low toxicity particles.",
            "The BAL protein at 24 h showed the strongest correlation with surface area (r2 = 0.98 and 0.86 at 3 h)(not shown).",
            "Since the QDs required thioglycolic acid as stabilizer, we exposed mice in the control group to a vehicle solution that contained this chemical.",
            "It is evident from the results that adding thioglycolic acid to the vehicle causes an inflammatory response with 2- to 6.5-fold increased mRNA cytokine levels after 3 h and 24 h, where the fraction of neutrophils was increased 4-fold.",
            "The pulmonary inflammation was quite severe following the instillation of QDs with increases of 25\u2013250-fold of the cytokine mRNA levels over the vehicle control.",
            "Almost all cells (93\u201397%) in the BAL fluid were neutrophils at 24 h.",
            "However, there was a remarkably similar magnitude of the inflammatory response of both negatively and positively charged QDs.",
            "We are not aware of other in vivo studies on cytokine induction by QD exposure.",
            "However it has been shown that several different cytokines, including IL-6 and MCP-1 are induced 2- to 3-fold in human epidermal keratinocytes and rat mesenchymal stem cells following QD exposure.",
            "The CdSe QDs used with the cells were coated with ZnS shell, which probably decreases the toxicity.",
            "Similarly mice have been injected i.v. with CdSe QDs, but no noticeable adverse effects or signs of necrosis at sites of deposition were reported.",
            "It therefore appears likely that cadmium was leaking from the QDs that we tested.",
            "Indeed, Pearson and co-workers measured BAL protein following instillation of different concentrations of Cd2+ in Male CF-1 mice.",
            "If we expect effects of the same magnitude this would mean that 18\u201326% of the cadmium in the QD620 and QD621 delivered to the mice might have been dissolved.",
            "However, this will be overestimated if intact QDs or free telluride also show toxicity.",
            "We determined the level of DNA damage by the comet assay in BAL cells 3 h following pulmonary exposure of all particles.",
            "At this time point the fraction of neutrophils was small and the BAL fluid primarily contained macrophages.",
            "The DNA damage increased significantly following exposure to SWCNT, CB and QDs, but only marginally with C60 and gold nanoparticles.",
            "QDs were also much more genotoxic than the other particles with a more than 3-fold increase in the level of DNA damage.",
            "Even when compared to the genotoxic carbonaceous particles (SWCNT and CB) we detected about 2-fold more DNA damage in the BAL cells.",
            "This may be a result of severe oxidative stress induced by cadmium leaked from the QDs.",
            "Indeed cadmium has been shown to induce oxidative stress with DNA damage and impair repair in several cell types.",
            "The comet assay is considered to be a sensitive assay for detection of the genotoxic effect of particulate matter as has been shown by several studies on air pollution particles.",
            "DNA damage is an important mechanism in carcinogenesis but the quantitative relationship of DNA damage and the development of cancer are not clear and it is probably different for different chemicals and for different cell populations.",
            "In this study we investigated DNA damage in BAL cells and not lung tissue, where lung disease would normally arise.",
            "We believe that the effects observed in BAL cells are similar in the epithelial cell of the lung surface because they are located closely together.",
            "However, detecting effects in lung tissue is difficult because only a fraction of cells in the lung tissue is exposed and the effects are diluted within the cell population.",
            "We have previously shown that CB exposure increased the level of strand breaks as well as mutation frequency in a mouse lung epithelial cell line.",
            "We suspect a high ROS production to be the cause of these effects as repeatedly suggested.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Here we report that ApoE-/- mice is a sensitive model for comparing inflammatory potential of (nano) particle instillation.",
            "CB and SWCNT caused more inflammation and DNA and cell damage than C60 did.",
            "This inflammatory signalling appeared shorter for SWCNT than for CB and C60.",
            "The instilled surface area of low toxicity low solubility particles appears to be a good predictor for inflammatory response in vivo.",
            "QDs were the most toxic particle likely because of a Cd effect.",
            "Gold particles, at a lower dose than the other particles, did not induce an inflammatory or toxic response in the mice.",

            "We have retained the data from these mice in the dataset for two reasons: The data from the heterozygous mice were not different from the homozygous ApoE-/- mice and the experimental setup was designed to minimize the effect of day-to-day experimental variation in the exposure by having mice in different groups being exposed at the same day.",

            "A brief monitoring survey conducted by EPA Regional Offices found VC in ambient air around poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) production plants.",
            "As a consequence of this survey, a second monitoring program was established to measure VC in the air around VC and PVC production plants.",
            "This program found some relatively high concentrations of VC in ambient air around the plants.",
            "This program found maximum 24-hr average concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 10.6 parts of VC per million parts of air.",
            "The program also found an apparent relationship between certain emission excursions and ambient VC concentrations.",
            "A third monitoring program was established to measure VC around PVC fabrication plants.",
            "This monitoring program found much less VC around PVC fabrication plants than around VC and PVC production plants.",
            "In conclusion, VC was found in ambient air around VC production plants and PVC fabrication plants.",
            "However, the data show that much less VC escapes into surrounding air from PVC fabricating plants than from VC and PVC production plants.",
            "Before development of an emission standard for vinyl chloride, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted three programs to mea- sure vinyl chloride (VC) concentrations in air around plants which either manufacture VC or use VC (1).",
            "The first program was a quick survey designed to estimate the magnitude of the ambient VC prob- lem.",
            "The second was a program to measure VC around a VC manufacturing plant and around two plants that polymerize VC monomer to form poly- (vinyl chloride) (PVC).",
            "And the third program was designed to measure VC around five plants that form the PVC into consumer products.",
            "In early 1974, former EPA Administrator Rus- sell Train established a task force to determine what action EPA should take to protect the public from inadvertent exposure to VC, a compound which had been shown to cause cancer in man.",
            "A major objective of the task force was to collect information on the concentration of VC in air *Emission Standards and Engineering Division (MD-13), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, 27711.",
            "around VC and PVC plants.",
            "Because of the appar- ent urgency of the problem, it was decided that EPA Regional Offices should conduct a brief moni- toring program around one or more plants in their region.",
            "Accordingly, on very short notice and with little equipment and planning, the seven Regional Offices where these plants were located carried out a brief monitoring program (2a).",
            "The sampling and analytical procedures used for this brief monitoring program had not been rigorously tested at the time, but because of the urgent need for data, all Regional Offices attempted to follow the procedures carefully.",
            "Some were more successful than others.",
            "Both the sample collection procedures and the analytical procedure have sub- sequently been shown to be satisfactory.",
            "Sampling was done in two ways: \"discrete\" samples (glass syringes, glass tubes, vacuum con- tainers, or Tedlar bags) and \"integrated\" 24-hr samples (a known flow rate of air passed through a charcoal adsorption column for 24 hr) (2b).",
            "The samples were taken to a laboratory and analyzed by gas chromatography.",
            "Any vinyl chloride found in October     the samples could then be expressed as an \"instan- taneous\" concentration (micrograms per cubic meter, ,ug/m3, or parts per million by volume, ppm) for discrete samples or as 24-hr average concentration for a 24-hr integrated sample.",
            "The results from this brief monitoring program were, perforce, less than satisfactory.",
            "Table 2 summarizes the data gathered around each plant (2a).",
            "Lack of equipment, unskilled personnel and unusual weather patterns combined to produce many blank samples or data of unknown accuracy.",
            "The most important conclusions from the experiment were that VC could be found in ambient air near PVC plants and that a much better monitoring program was needed.",
            "It must be remembered that the analytical accuracy is unknown, and that low values could mean either low emissions from the plant, adverse meteorology, or inappropriate sam- pling times.",
            "From this brief program it was apparent that vinyl chloride could be found in ambient air around PVC plants and that a more rigorous monitoring program was warranted.",
            "Accordingly, a major effort went into setting up and carrying out a study of the VC around two PVC plants and one plant which produces the VC monomer.",
            "Simultaneously, a more modest study was begun to measure the VC around plants which fabricate PVC into consumer products, because the fabricating operations can liberate occluded VC from the PVC raw material.",
            "The major monitoring program carried out by EPA was designed to validate a mathematical model which attempted to simulate emissions from any VC or PVC plant (3).",
            "Table 3 summarizes the sampling periods at the VC and PVC plants chosen for the program.",
            "A number of 24-hr integrated samplers were set up around each of these plants at various directions and distances after a study of the meteorology of the area.",
            "In general, two samples were collected per week at each sampling site and 204 returned to the laboratory for gas chromatographic analysis.",
            "The majority of the stations were in the predicted downwind direction, while a smaller number was distributed in upwind directions in order to establish background levels of VC in the incoming air.",
            "Partway through the program, when it became clear that the prevailing meteorological patterns were different from the predicted ones, it was decided to concentrate all samplers for one- month periods at two of the plants in sequence.",
            "In addition, one continuous sampler was used during the sampling program at Aberdeen and two and three continuous samplers were used during the sampling programs at Norco and Louisville, respectively.",
            "The purpose of these samplers was to evaluate their reliability and to observe any rapid excursions of vinyl chloride, should they occur.",
            "Information from these samplers was limited be- cause, on many days, they did not operate due to malfunctions.",
            "The data collected at the sampling sites are summarized in Table 4 (3).",
            "Interpretation of the data would be useful in two respects.",
            "First, it would be useful to determine if there are any relationships between peak concentrations and specific emission sources or plant operations, and if so, to define these relationships.",
            "Second, it would be useful to evaluate the significance of the results in terms of public health effects.",
            "Any interpretations are limited by a couple of factors, however.",
            "First, a large portion of the samplers were located on plant property rather than in residential areas because the purpose of the sampling program was to vali- date a mathematical model.",
            "Second, during the sampling programs, VC and PVC plants in general were not operating at their normal capacities due to economic conditions.",
            "The VC plant used in the program was operating between 50 and 110% of its capacity, averaging about 70%.",
            "Also, in PVC plants particularly, there are a large number of emission Environmental Health Perspectives sources and fluctuations in emissions.",
            "PVC production, unlike VC production, is largely a batch operation rather than a continuous operation.",
            "Since only abnormal plant occurrences were requested to be reported to EPA, normal fluctuations in emis- sions cannot be compared with ambient concentra- tions.",
            "Furthermore, the placement of samplers and the meteorological conditions at the time of an emission excursion are important in determining which samplers, if any, are affected.",
            "Obviously, enough samplers cannot be placed around a plant to pick up all emission excursions.",
            "Also, the degree of variability in meteorological conditions during the 24-hr period when an integrated sample is collected affects the amount of VC collected in that sample.",
            "Although definitive conclusions cannot be made about the results from the sampling program, observations can be made by selecting out the relatively high readings, looking at the wind speed and direction, and thereby determining the proba- ble source of emissions.",
            "The maximum 24-hr average value observed at the Louisville PVC plant occurred on a day when a relatively large number of the samplers both on and off plant property (9 out of 38) had relatively high readings (500 ,ug/m3 or 0.198 ppm) compared with other-day samples taken at this plant (1).",
            "The only nonroutine operation recorded by the plant that day was a reactor relief discharge.",
            "This is not necessarily the cause of the higher values obtained by the 24-hr samplers due to October 1981 their long averaging time.",
            "However, there were three peak 1-hr average values on the continuous monitor that day (2.00 ppm, 2.00 ppm, and 2.44 ppm).",
            "Two of these occurred about the time of the relief discharge.",
            "The wind was blowing in the direction of the continuous monitor at that time.",
            "There were sec-;r?l other days during the sampling program on which there were relief discharges.",
            "On all of these days except one, the continuous moni- tors were not operating.",
            "On that day, one monitor was operating but the wind was not blowing from the plant to the monitor.",
            "PVC is formed into thousands of user-products, but the majority of the material goes into a rela- tively few basic products.",
            "It was decided that the PVC fabrication plant study should focus on five of these large-use products and that the largest plants producing these products should be monitored, if at all possible (4a).",
            "Table 5 lists the pertinent informa- tion about these plants.",
            "The PVC fabrication plant study consisted of collecting 24-hr integrated samples daily on each of the four sides of the plants, as close to the fence line as possible, for two week periods.",
            "A minimum of 56 samples were thus collected at each plant.",
            "The samples were returned to the laboratory and ana- lyzed by gas chromatography.",
            "Table 6 summarizes the data from this study (4b).",
            "A rigorous quality aThe plants were evaluated by using meteorological data from Houston, Texas.",
            "Receptors were assumed to be located at 80 m in tervals from the center of the plant.",
            "Effective height of emissions was the stack height.",
            "Fugitive emissions were treated at 100 x 100 m area sources at 6 m above ground.",
            "Other sources are all treated as point sources, located at the center of the area source.",
            "control program was instituted at the beginning of the study, so that the analytical data are considered reliable.",
            "In addition, some duplicate samples were collected and analyzed by independent laboratories, thus adding to the confidence in the data.",
            "The minimum detectable concentration of VC by the method used was 0.5 ppb.",
            "The data show that much less VC escapes into surrounding air from PVC fabricating plants than from VC and PVC produc- tion plants.",
            "During the development of the emission standard for vinyl chloride promulgated on October 21, 1976, dispersion modeling was applied to estimate the impact of alternative control levels on ambient concentrations of vinyl chloride resulting from unregulated emissions.",
            "The ambient concentrations were calculated in terms of 5-min averages, 24-hr averages, and annual averages (5).",
            "Table 7 shows 24-hr average maximum concentrations.",
            "These con- centrations can be compared to the ambient moni- toring information found in Table 4.",
            "For example, the 24-hr maximum average value found at the Norco plant was 10.6 ppm, and an estimated concentration would be about 1 ppm.",
            "In another example, the 24-hr maximum average value found at the Aberdeen PVC plant was 9.2 ppm, and an estimated concentration would be about 20 ppm.",
            "In conclusion, VC was found in ambient air around VC production plants, PVC production plants and PVC fabrication plants.",
            "However, the data show that much less VC escapes into surrounding air from PVC fabricating plants than from VC and PVC production plants."

            "Findings in humans and animal models suggest that in utero hormonal and dietary exposures increase later breast cancer risk.",
            "Since alcohol intake by adult women consistently increases their breast cancer risk, we wondered whether maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases female offspring's mammary tumorigenesis.",
            "In our study, pregnant female rats were pair-fed isocaloric diets containing either 0 (control), 16 or 25\u2009g alcohol\u2009kg\u22121 feed between days 7 and 19 of gestation.",
            "These alcohol exposures generate blood alcohol levels that correspond to low and moderate alcohol consumption and are lower than those that induce foetal alcohol syndrome.",
            "Serum oestradiol levels were elevated in pregnant rats exposed to alcohol (P<0.003).",
            "When adult, female offspring of alcohol-exposed dams developed significantly more 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene -induced mammary tumours, compared to the controls (tumour multiplicity; mean\u00b1s.e.m., controls: 2.0\u00b10.3, 16\u2009g alcohol: 2.7\u00b10.4 and 25\u2009g alcohol: 3.7\u00b10.4; P<0.006).",
            "In addition, the mammary epithelial tree of the alcohol-exposed offspring was denser (P<0.004) and contained more structures that are susceptible for the initiation of breast cancer (P<0.001).",
            "Immunohistochemical assessment indicated that the mammary glands of 22-week-old in utero alcohol-exposed rats contained elevated levels of oestrogen receptor-\u03b1 (P<0.04) that is consistent with the changes in mammary gland morphology.",
            "In summary, maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy increases female offspring's mammary tumorigenesis, perhaps by programming the foetal mammary gland to exhibit persistent alterations in morphology and gene expression.",
            "It remains to be determined whether an increase in pregnancy oestradiol levels mediated alcohol's effects on offspring's mammary tumorigenesis.",
            "Some breast cancers may be pre-initiated in utero following an exposure to elevated maternal oestrogen levels that stimulate the growth of foetal mammary gland and might cause long-lasting alterations in the expression of oestrogen-regulated genes.",
            "Our goal has been to identify factors that modify pregnancy oestrogen levels and daughter's breast cancer risk.",
            "These studies have to be performed first using animal models that mimic human breast cancer, since it is difficult to examine interactions between in utero exposures and breast cancer that is detected several decades later in women.",
            "One factor that might modify pregnancy hormone levels is diet: for example, maternal intake of a high-fat n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid diet increases both pregnancy oestradiol (E2) levels and carcinogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis among female offspring, mimicking the effects seen when pregnant dams are treated with E2.",
            "Another dietary factor that might modify pregnancy E2 levels is alcohol.",
            "Alcohol intake increases serum oestrogen levels, possibly by stimulating aromatase activity, and alcohol has been consistently linked to increased risk of developing breast cancer.",
            "Studies in humans indicate that mothers reporting having consumed some alcohol during pregnancy have higher pregnancy E2 levels than women who do not drink any alcohol during pregnancy.",
            "It is not known, however, whether alcohol exposure in utero through a pregnant mother increases later breast cancer risk.",
            "The aim of our study was to determine whether maternal alcohol exposure increases pregnancy E2 levels and female offspring's risk of developing mammary tumours in rats.",
            "In addition, we studied possible changes in the mammary gland morphology and expression of oestrogen receptor (ER)-\u03b1.",
            "These receptors mediate the effects of oestrogens on the breast, through a complex signalling network, and are clearly involved in the mammary gland development.",
            "Findings in vitro indicate that alcohol increases ER-\u03b1 expression in human breast cancer cells.",
            "Further, earlier human studies have shown that high alcohol intake is linked to increased mammographic density that in turn is associated with increased breast cancer risk.",
            "Findings in animal studies also suggest that alcohol modifies mammary gland development.",
            "The goal of our study was to determine whether alcohol exposure during pregnancy might increase mammary gland ER-\u03b1 levels, epithelial density and number of epithelial targets for malignant transformation (terminal end buds (TEBs)).",

            "Maternal alcohol exposure",
            "Pregnant Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River on day 7 of gestation.",
            "The rats were housed individually in standard rat plexiglas cages, at a constant temperature and humidity, under a 12-h light\u2013dark cycle (lights on 0600\u2009h).",
            "All the experiments reported in this manuscript were carried out with the appropriate institutional ethical committee approval and they met the standards of both the US federal regulations and those required by the UKCCCR guidelines.",
            "To examine whether maternal alcohol intake affects pregnancy oestrogen levels and offspring's mammary tumorigenesis, the rats were divided into three groups (n=15 per group) upon arrival on gestation day 7, and were pair-fed isocaloric liquid diets containing either 0 (control), 16\u2009g (low, 7% alcohol of total energy) or 25\u2009g (moderate, 15% alcohol of total energy) alcohol\u2009kg\u22121 feed.",
            "Other ingredients of the diets were Premix, oil, maltose-dextrin, and deionised water.",
            "Diet ingredients were provided by Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, N. J. Pre-mix contained the following ingredients (given as g\u2009l\u22121): casein (41.4), DL-methionine (0.3), L-cystine (0.5), cellulose (10), xanthan gum (3), complete mineral mix (8.75), complete vitamin mix (2.5) and choline bitartrate (0.53).",
            "The oil mix contained corn oil (8.5), olive oil (28.4) and safflower oil (2.7)",
            "The control diet also had 115.2\u2009g of maltodextrin, and the alcohol-containing diets had an amount of maltodextrin removed equivalent to the calories of the added alcohol.",
            "Diets were prepared twice a week using a commercial blender.",
            "We did not determine blood alcohol levels (BAL) in this experiment, but were able to estimate them based on previous studies that used identical diets used here.",
            "Our estimates were also based on the linearity of BAL following administration of different levels of alcohol.",
            "According to these estimates, BAL for the rats receiving the 16\u2009g alcohol kg diet is 61.3\u00b15.0\u2009mg\u2009dl\u22121, and for the 25\u2009g alcohol kg diet is 95.8\u00b16.1\u2009mg\u2009dl\u22121.",
            "These BAL are similar to those seen in low-to-modest alcohol drinkers, respectively, and lower than those found to induce foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).",
            "Since alcohol intoxication might disrupt normal labour and care of newborn pups, we withdrew pregnant rats from alcohol on gestation day 19.",
            "All the animals were fed AIN93 diets from that point onwards.",

            "On gestation day 19, blood was obtained by cardiac puncture to determine circulating 17\u03b2-oestradiol (E2) levels in dams fed 0 (control), 16 or 25\u2009g alcohol per kg feed between gestation days 7 and 19.",
            "For that purpose, a specific double antibody kit from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA, USA) was used following the manufacturer's instructions.",

            "The mechanisms mediating the effects of in utero exposures on later risk of developing breast cancer could include changes in the mammary gland morphology and expression of genes regulating it.",
            "Therefore, wholemounts of the fourth abdominal glands, obtained at different ages and processed as previously described, were assessed for changes in the morphology.",
            "The relative densities of epithelial tree, alveolar buds and lobules were determined in the 8- and 22-week-old rats using a five-point visual scale (from: 0=absent, to 5=numerous) we have previously validated.",
            "The total number of TEBs was counted in 3-, 6-and 8-week-old offspring; that is, at times when their number is at the highest and before they differentiate to lobular\u2013alveolar structures.",
            "Identification of each of the epithelial structures was based on the guidelines of mammary gland morphology by.",
            "All the analyses were done double-blinded under an Olympus dissecting microscope.",
            "Oestrogen receptors",
            "We determined ER-\u03b1 expression in the mammary glands of 22-week-old rats by immunocytochemistry using MC-20 antibody for ER-\u03b1 (rabbit polyclonal IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) at 1\u2009:\u2009100 dilution.",
            "The level of expression was assessed in three ductal and three lobular structures per section.",
            "Oestrogen receptor-\u03b1 protein levels were quantitated by using a 0\u20135 scale (O=lowest and 5=highest) to determine the percentile of cells showing nuclear staining, and a 0\u20133 scale to determine the staining intensity.",
            "The average scores for percentile cells stained and staining intensity were added together separately in lobules and ducts.",
            "We also investigated the validity of our quantification method.",
            "This was done by determining ER-\u03b1 levels in 8-week-old nontreated rats that were randomly divided to three groups (n=5 each).",
            "If significant differences were found among the groups that should be similar (all nontreated animals), this would suggest that our approach did not reliably predict the true differences between the control and experimental mammary glands.",
            "Effects on offspring's mammary tumorigenesis",
            "Mammary tumours were induced by administration of 10\u2009mg (\u223c50\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 body weight) 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) to 47-day-old female rats (n=23\u201325 per group).",
            "The histopathology, oestrogen dependence, oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression and antioestrogen responsiveness of the DMBA-induced tumours closely reflect human breast cancer.",
            "More than 75% of the tumours induced by 10\u2009mg DMBA are adenocarcinomas; in our previous experiments, the proportion of adenocarcinomas in the DMBA control group was 80\u2013100%.",
            "The carcinogen was dissolved in peanut oil and administered by oral gavage in a volume of 1\u2009ml.",
            "The animals were examined for mammary tumours by palpation once per week.",
            "The end points for data analysis were: (i) latency to tumour appearance, (ii) the number of animals with tumours (tumour incidence), (iii) the number of tumours per animal (tumour multiplicity) and (iv) tumour growth rate.",
            "During the follow-up, those animals in which tumour burden approximated 10% of total body weight were killed, as required by our institution.",
            "All surviving animals, including those that did not appear to develop mammary tumours, were killed 17 weeks after carcinogen administration.",
            "Statistical analyses",
            "Results for the data obtained on: (i) pregnancy-related parameters (pregnancy weight gain, birth weight, number of pups per litter and pregnancy serum E2 levels); (ii) mammary gland morphology (total number of TEBs and density of epithelial tree, ABs and lobules in the whole mounts), (iii) ER-\u03b1 protein levels and (iv) some mammary tumour end points (latency and multiplicity) were analysed using one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).",
            "When determining latency, only the week when the first tumour was detected was assessed.",
            "Animals that did not develop tumours were included in the analysis and given a latency value of the length of follow-up plus one week (18 weeks).",
            "When assessing tumour multiplicity, animals that did not develop any tumours were given a value 0.",

            "Post hoc analysis revealed that the increase was significant between the control and moderate-alcohol groups.",
            "The tumour incidence in all groups approached 100% and, therefore, no differences in this end point among in utero alcohol-exposed and control rats were seen.",
            "However, the incidence was consistently higher in the alcohol groups than controls during each of the 17 weeks of tumour growth monitoring (Figure 2c).",

            "The total number of TEBs, assessed in wholemounts of 3-, 6- and 8-week-old rats, was dose-dependently increased during weeks 6 and 8 (F(2,39)=12.6, P<0.001) (Figure 3c).",
            "Representative wholemounts of the fourth abdominal gland in 22-week-old offspring of dams exposed to control, low (16\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121 feed) and moderate (25\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121 feed) alcohol during pregnancy are also shown (Figure 3d).",

            "The validation study that determined ER-\u03b1 expression using immunohistochemistry in the mammary glands of three similar groups of nontreated animals showed no differences in either the lobular or ductal ER-\u03b1 expression among the groups.",
            "The proportion of cells stained and staining intensity in the nontreated animals in three lobular and three ductal structures per gland were evaluated using scales of 0\u20135 and 0\u20133, respectively.",

            "DISCUSSION",
            "Many dietary factors are suggested to be linked to either increased or reduced breast cancer risk, but the data supporting these associations are mostly contradictory.",
            "Alcohol consumption is an exception, and there is a consensus that alcohol intake increases the risk of developing breast cancer.",
            "Some epidemiological studies suggest that alcohol drinking during adolescence and early adulthood has the strongest impact on breast cancer risk, while results of some studies indicate that drinking later in life increases breast cancer risk most.",
            "Data obtained in the present study suggest that alcohol exposure already in utero through a pregnant mother may increase breast cancer risk.",
            "The idea that some breast cancers are pre-initiated in utero is supported by several indirect observations in human populations.",
            "These studies show that women who were exposed to high foetal oestrogenic environment; that is, had a high birth weight or are twins, are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer.",
            "At a particularly high risk are twins whose birth weight was high.",
            "A recent study also found that women exposed to the synthetic oestrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer.",
            "Animal studies support the hypothesis.",
            "In rats, maternal exposure to either oestradiol or DES increases the offspring's breast cancer risk.",
            "We found that maternal exposure to relatively low alcohol levels increased pregnancy E2 levels in rats.",
            "Previous human studies have shown that both acute and chronic alcohol consumption increases circulating E2 levels in non-pregnant women, possibly by alcohol-induced increase in aromatase activity.",
            "A positive association between alcohol intake during pregnancy and pregnancy oestrogen levels in humans has also been reported.",
            "Thus, the present data in animals and earlier data in humans show that maternal alcohol consumption increases pregnancy E2 levels.",
            "However, since the dams kept on the highest alcohol diet did not show a significant increase in pregnancy E2 levels, although this group showed most differences in tumorigenesis, it remains to be determined whether the increased oestrogenicity in alcohol-exposed pregnant dams explains their offspring's increased mammary tumorigenesis.",
            "The mechanisms mediating the effect of in utero alcohol exposure on mammary tumorigenesis may be linked to changes in mammary gland morphology and gene expression.",
            "Oestrogens stimulate normal mammary epithelial and tumour cell proliferation, also when administered neonatally.",
            "In vitro and in vivo studies show that alcohol increases normal and malignant mammary cell proliferation.",
            "In humans, alcohol is associated with increased mammographic density, and increased density is linked to four- to six-fold increase in breast cancer risk.",
            "These findings suggest that elevated oestrogen levels in utero may have led to increased mammary epithelial density seen in rats exposed to alcohol in utero, and the increased density in turn increased the risk of developing mammary tumours.",
            "Earlier studies have reported that rats exposed to diets containing 15\u201320% of energy from alcohol as juveniles exhibit an increased number of TEBs and reduced lobular and alveolar bud structures in their mammary glands.",
            "We found that rats exposed to alcohol in utero had an increased number of TEBs, suggesting that alcohol exposure during foetal life modifies the pathways controlling development of the mammary gland.",
            "Further, since TEBs are targets for malignant transformation, their increased presence could explain why alcohol increases mammary tumorigenesis.",
            "In addition to affecting mammary gland morphology, in utero alcohol exposure was found to increase the expression of ER-\u03b1 in the mammary gland, consistent with earlier in vitro data and data showing that the level of alcohol intake correlates with ER-\u03b1 expression in human breast tumours.",
            "Activation of ER-\u03b1 induces proliferation of normal and malignant breast cells, and is associated with promotion of breast cancer.",
            "If ER-\u03b1 is important in mediating the effects of in utero alcohol exposure in increasing breast cancer risk, its levels should be elevated in women who develop breast cancer.",
            "This assumption is supported by findings showing that normal cells in the breasts containing a tumour express higher levels of ER-\u03b1 than the cells in the breast containing a benign lesion.",
            "Further, breast ER-\u03b1 levels are significantly lower in the Asian women exhibiting a low breast cancer risk than in the Caucasian women exhibiting a high breast cancer risk.",
            "Findings obtained in this study showing that maternal alcohol intake increased offspring's mammary tumorigenesis suggest that the role of maternal diet in modifying pregnancy oestrogen levels and affecting daughter's breast cancer risk should be investigated further.",
            "Since oestrogen levels vary by four- to six-fold among women undergoing normal pregnancy, and the reasons for the variability remain poorly understood, it is essential to identify dietary factors that modify pregnancy oestrogen levels and could therefore potentially affect daughter's breast cancer risk.",
            "Alcohol might be one of these factors.",
            "It has been known for some time that maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause FAS or its less severe manifestation, foetal alcohol effects in the offspring.",
            "The fact that maternal alcohol intake at levels that are considerable lower than those inducing FAS might also increase daughter's breast cancer risk gives further weight to the recommendation that women should avoid consuming alcohol during pregnancy."

            "In the Norwegian part of the study, ORs were also calculated dichotomising on age and lag time until cancer diagnosis.",
            "Higher odds ratios for anal cancer were observed among HPV 16 seropositive subjects above 45 years of age (OR=7.3; 95%CI=1.5\u201337) and with less than 10 years lag (OR=6.2; 95%CI=1.4\u201326), with adjustment for the other serotypes.",

            "DISCUSSION",
            "The present study has provided prospective epidemiological evidence that infection with HPV 16 and 18 does confer an increased risk for future anal and perianal skin cancer.",
            "The highest risks were seen for HPV 16 seropositive patients above the age of 45 years at serum sampling and for patients with a lag time of less than 10 years.",
            "The role of a sexually transmitted agent in the etiology of anal cancer was first suggested in 1979.",
            "Similar to the cervix, the anal canal has a squamocolumnar junction or transformation zone, which appears to be particularly susceptible to HPV infection, and the concomitant risk of intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma.",
            "It is now well established that HPV play a central role in the pathogenesis of anogenital cancers and their precursors.",
            "HPV DNA has been detected in invasive as well as in anal squamous intraepithelial lesions.",
            "HPV 16 is the most common type found.",
            "In situ hybridisation studies have found 24\u201373% of cases to be HPV DNA positive, whereas the corresponding figures for Southern blot and PCR studies are 63\u201385% and 24\u2013100%, respectively.",
            "HPV DNA is almost always found integrated into the host chromosome, but it is frequently coexistent with episomal DNA in the cell nucleus.",
            "However, the detection of HPV DNA implies current infection only.",
            "Prior exposure is not necessarily reflected.",
            "By applying HPV serology, a marker of both past and present HPV infection, it has been possible to investigate possible temporal associations of HPV infection with anal cancer.",
            "Previously, a serologic association of HPV 16 with incident anal cancer has been reported.",
            "In our previous, prospective study, no association of HPV and anal cancer was found, although a high, but insignificant risk was found for perianal skin cancer.",
            "The present expanded study is, to our knowledge, the first study providing prospective epidemiologic evidence of an association between HPV infection and anal and perianal skin cancer.",
            "Subjects seropositive for HPV 16 and also for HPV 18 were at an increased risk.",
            "Patients with HPV DNA in their anal tumours have been reported to be about 10 years younger than those with HPV DNA-negative anal cancers.",
            "In this study, the mean age of the cases being seropositive for any HPV was 54 years, whereas the mean age of the seronegative cases was 53 years.",
            "At present, the incidence of anal cancer is about two to three times higher in women than in men.",
            "Particularly in women, the incidence has increased substantially over the past decades.",
            "A higher proportion of anal cancer cases has been reported to be positive for HPV DNA in women compared to men.",
            "In the present study, 28% of the female and 30% of the male cases were seropositive for HPV 16.",
            "Similar figures for HPV 18 were 17% and 20%, respectively.",
            "In summary, this study provides prospective epidemiological evidence indicating that infection with HPV 16 and also HPV 18 does increase the risk for subsequent development of anal and perianal skin cancer."

            "Symptoms",
            "The prevalences of cough, phlegm production, chronic bronchitis, and wheezing with dyspnea were the highest among the chipping and washing workers, intermediate among the reduction workers, and lowest among the maintenance workers (table I).",
            "There was no significant difference in the prevalence of symptoms between the groups.",

            "After adjustment for these variables, the number of years worked in the reduction area was related to a reduction of 24 ml per year.",
            "Chest radiographs",
            "Small irregular opacities of profusion 1/0 were present in the radiographs of nine subjects (eight of these were type t).",
            "The prevalence was 3 070 among the reduction workers (two cases), 4 % among the chipping and washing workers (three cases), and 7 % among the maintenance workers (four cases).",
            "Small round opacities of profusion 1/0 were present in the radiographs of only three subjects (one chipping and washing worker and two maintenance and service workers).",
            "There were no radiographs in which the profusion of opacities exceeded 1/0.",
            "Pleural disease, including pleural plaques and diffuse pleural thickening, was present in the radiographs of 36 subjects.",
            "The prevalence was 10 OJo among the reduction workers (eight cases), 22 % among the chipping and washing workers (16 cases), and 21 % among the maintenance and service workers (12 cases).",
            "Pleural disease was strongly associated with the duration of work in titanium manufacturing (table 3) and was also associated with previous asbestos exposure.",
            "Among those workers who had no previous asbestos exposure, the risk of pleural disease for those who had been employed for at least 10 years in titanium manufacturing was 3.8 times that for workers who had been employed for less than five years.",

            "After allowance for the effect of work in titanium manufacturing, previous asbestos exposure was not significantly related to pleural thickening (p = 0.12), nor was cigarette smoking (p=0.18).",

            "There were no significant differences in pulmonary function, symptom prevalence, abnormalities revealed in the physical examination, or pulmonary function between the subjects who had pleural thickening and those who did not.",
            "Discussion",
            "Our choice of maintenance and service workers as a comparison group for production workers in the assessment of respiratory symptoms and pleural disease probably led to an underestimation of any true association which existed -.",
            "The maintenance and service workers had a higher prevalence of cigarette smoking and also had a higher prevalence of past asbestos exposure than the reduction workers.",
            "These factors may have increased their prevalence of respiratory symptoms and chest radiograph abnormalities and may have adversely affected their pulmonary function.",
            "The etiology of the reduced ventilatory capacity is unclear from the information available.",
            "An industrial hygiene survey carried out in the plant by NIOSH during this investigation indicated that exposures to hydrochloric acid were negligible and that there was no measurable exposure to volatile organics or asbestos.",
            "Total particulates, consisting primarily of titanium dioxide, ranged from 0.2 to 2.8 mg/rn! in the reduction area.",
            "Titanium tetrachloride, which is used in the reduction area, was not measured.",
            "This material probably represents the greatest acute hazard in the plant when it is inadvertantly released into the air.",
            "It spontaneously combines with water vapor to produce a dense cloud of titanium dioxide, hydrochloric acid, and titanium oxychloride.",
            "Experiments with dogs in repeated exposures have shown that it causes a reduction in pulmonary capacity and proliferation of connective tissue (14).",
            "Although no asbestos was detected in the air at the time of the survey by NIOSH, asbestos had been used in the past in heat shielding drapes in the reduction area and in insulation for pipes throughout the plant.",
            "We presume that asbestos exposure may have contributed to the pleural thickening in some of the subjects, particularly in the maintenance workers who were responsible for pipefitting and maintaining the reduction furnaces.",
            "No measurements of past asbestos exposure in the plant were available, so it is unclear whether or not asbestos exposure could explain the pattern of pleural thickening seen among the workers.",
            "The observation that pleural thickening was more common among the chipping and washing workers is difficult to explain on the basis of asbestos exposure, as work in the chipping and washing area did not apparently involve exposure to asbestos, whereas maintenance workers and reduction workers maintained and operated asbestos-insulated equipment.",
            "The pleural thickening of the chipping and washing workers was less extensive in terms of its thickness and length along the lateral chest wall than that of the maintenance workers.",
            "These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that an agent other than asbestos also contributed to the development of pleural thickening.",
            "There are indications that the inhalation of titanium dioxide by humans may cause localized increases in connective tissue in the lungs (4) and ti ta nium dioxide to accumulate in patches on the lung surface (9).",
            "Similar findings among rats also suggest that pleu ra l changes may occur in response to the inhalation of titanium dioxide (3).",
            "Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that titanium dioxide may co ntribute to the de velopment of pleural thickening , but they are not co nclusive because of the limited information available regarding past asbestos exposure in the plant.",
            "Our data do not show a clear association between pleural thickening and a reduction in ventila to ry capacity, and therefore these abnormalities may not be related to a common exposure.",
            "Reductions in the FEY 1.0 in relation to work in the reduction area and pleural thickening among the chipping and wa shing and maintenance workers support this view.",
            "This issue needs clarification.",

            "Background",
            "Phthalates are used extensively in many personal-care and consumer products, resulting in widespread nonoccupational human exposure through multiple routes and media.",
            "A limited number of animal studies suggest that exposure to phthalates may be associated with altered thyroid function, but human data are lacking.",
            "Methods",
            "Concurrent samples of urine and blood were collected from 408 men.",
            "We measured urinary concentrations of mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the hydrolytic metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and other phthalate monoester metabolites, along with serum levels of free thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).",
            "Oxidative metabolites of DEHP were measured in urine from only 208 of the men.",
            "Results",
            "We found an inverse association between MEHP urinary concentrations and free T4 and T3 serum levels, although the relationships did not appear to be linear when MEHP concentrations were categorized by quintiles.",
            "There was evidence of a plateau at the fourth quintile, which was associated with a 0.11 ng/dL decrease in free T4 [95% confidence interval (CI), \u20130.18 to \u20130.03] and a 0.05 ng/mL decrease in T3 (95% CI, \u20130.10 to 0.01) compared with the first (lowest) MEHP quintile.",
            "The inverse relationship between MEHP and free T4 remained when we adjusted for oxidative metabolite concentrations; this simultaneously demonstrated a suggestive positive association with free T4.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Urinary MEHP concentrations may be associated with altered free T4 and/or total T3 levels in adult men, but additional study is needed to confirm the observed findings.",
            "Future studies must also consider oxidative DEHP metabolites relative to MEHP as a potential marker of metabolic susceptibility to DEHP exposure.",
            "Human exposure to some industrial compounds may result in adverse health outcomes mediated through the neuroendocrine axis.",
            "These chemicals may affect the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the human body that are responsible for maintaining homeostasis, reproduction, development, and/or behavior.",
            "In addition to being essential for normal brain development, thyroid hormones play an important role in many physiologic systems, and alterations in thyroid hormone levels can lead to a myriad of adverse clinical conditions.",
            "Although much is still unknown about mechanisms and consequences involved with the relationship between environmental exposures and changes in thyroid hormone levels, phthalates and other environmental chemicals may bind to thyroid receptors and influence thyroid hormone signaling.",
            "Phthalates are used extensively in many personal-care and consumer products, resulting in widespread nonoccupational human exposure through multiple routes and media.",
            "High-molecular-weight phthalates [e.g., di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)], are primarily used as plasticizers in the manufacture of flexible vinyl, which is then used in consumer products, flooring and wall coverings, food contact applications, and medical devices.",
            "Low-molecular-weight phthalates [e.g., diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP)] are used in personal-care products (e.g., perfumes, lotions, cosmetics), as solvents and plasticizers for cellulose acetate, and in formulating lacquers, varnishes, and coatings, including those used to provide timed releases in some pharmaceuticals.",
            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals showed that the majority of males in the United States have detectable concentrations of several phthalate monoesters in urine [monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono(2-ethyl-hexyl) phthalate (MEHP), monobutyl phthalate (MBP), and monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP)], reflecting widespread exposure to the parent diester compounds among the general population.",
            "Two oxidative metabolites of DEHP, mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxylhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), were present in most subjects at urinary concentrations higher than those of MEHP, the hydrolytic metabolite of DEHP.",
            "Animal studies have shown that some phthalates, namely DBP, butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), and DEHP, cause testicular toxicity and other adverse male reproductive health outcomes, whereas human studies on phthalate exposure and male reproductive health have been inconsistent.",
            "Studies investigating the association between exposure to phthalates and thyroid function are limited.",
            "In animal studies, rats with diets contaminated with DEHP were found to have thyroid alterations and lower plasma thyroxine (T4) concentrations compared with controls.",
            "In addition, a recent in vitro study reported that DEHP and other phthalates caused changes in the iodide uptake of thyroid follicular cells.",
            "A dose-dependent inverse association between DBP and both triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 has also been reported in male rats.",
            "We are unaware of human studies on phthalates and thyroid function; therefore, we designed the present study to investigate potential relations between biological markers of phthalate exposure and levels of T4, T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotrophin, TSH) in adult men.",
            "Methods",
            "Subjects were recruited from an ongoing study on the relationship between environmental agents and male reproductive health.",
            "They were men who were partners in subfertile couples seeking evaluation between January 2000 and May 2004 from the Vincent Burnham Fertility Center at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA).",
            "The study was approved by the Human Studies Institutional Review Boards of the Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, the CDC, and the University of Michigan.",
            "After the study procedures were explained and all questions answered, subjects signed an informed consent.",
            "Men 18\u201355 years of age, who were not postvasectomy, were eligible to participate.",
            "Of those approached, approximately 65% consented.",
            "Most men who declined to participate in the study cited lack of time on the day of their clinic visit as the reason for not participating.",
            "Phthalate metabolites in urine",
            "On the day of each subject\u2019s clinic visit, a single spot urine sample was collected into a sterile specimen cup prescreened for phthalates.",
            "Phthalate metabolites were measured in urine because of potential sample contamination from the parent diester and because the metabolites, as opposed to the parent diesters, are believed to be the active toxicants.",
            "The analytical approach for the analysis of the urinary phthalate monoester metabolites (i.e., MEHP, MBP, MBzP, and MEP) and two oxidative metabolites of DEHP (i.e., MEHHP and MEOHP) involved enzymatic deconjugation of the metabolites from their glucuronidated form, solid-phase extraction, separation with HPLC, and detection by isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry.",
            "Detection limits were in the low nanogram per milliliter range and varied slightly by analytical batch for each phthalate metabolite (MEP, 1.00\u20131.21 ng/mL; MBP, 0.60\u20131.07 ng/mL; MBzP, 0.47\u20131.0 ng/mL; MEHP, 0.87\u20131.20 ng/mL; MEHHP, 0.95\u20131.60 ng/mL; MEOHP, 1.07\u20131.20 ng/mL).",
            "We used isotopically labeled internal standards and conjugated internal standards to increase precision of measurements.",
            "Along with the unknown samples, each analytical run included calibration standards, reagent blanks, and quality control materials of high and low concentrations to monitor for accuracy and precision.",
            "Analysts at the CDC were blind to all information concerning subjects.",
            "Urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations were adjusted for urine dilution by specific gravity (SG) using the following formula:",
            "where Pc is the SG-adjusted phthalate metabolite concentration (nanograms per milliliter), P is the observed phthalate metabolite concentration, and SG is the specific gravity of the urine sample.",
            "SG was measured using a hand-held refractometer (National Instrument Company, Inc., Baltimore, MD).",
            "Using the urinary concentrations of the three DEHP metabolites (i.e., MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP), we calculated the percentage of these DEHP metabolites excreted as the hydrolytic monoester (MEHP%).",
            "We consider the MEHP% a phenotypic marker of the proportion of DEHP metabolized to and excreted in the urine as MEHP.",
            "The greater the MEHP%, the larger the percentage of DEHP excreted as MEHP relative to the excretion of the two oxidative metabolites.",
            "To calculate MEHP%, we converted MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP concentrations to nanomoles per milliliter; divided MEHP concentrations by the sum of concentrations of MEOHP, MEHHP, and MEHP; and multiplied by 100.",
            "To our knowledge, the use of MEHP% as a phenotypic marker of DEHP metabolism and excretion is novel and has not been used in human health studies until recently.",
            "Thyroid hormones and TSH",
            "One non-fasting blood sample was drawn between 0900 and 1600 hours on the same day the urine sample was collected.",
            "Blood samples were centrifuged and serum stored at \u201380\u00b0C until analysis.",
            "Free T4, total T3, and TSH concentrations were determined in serum by microparticle enzyme immunoassay using an automated immunoassay system (AxSYM; Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL).",
            "The assay sensitivities for free T4 and total T3 were 0.01 ng/dL and 0.15 ng/mL, respectively.",
            "The interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) for both hormones were < 9%.",
            "For TSH, the ultrasensitive hTSH II assay was used with a functional sensitivity of 0.03 \u03bcIU/L and interassay CVs of < 8%.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "Data analysis was performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).",
            "Descriptive statistics on subject demographics were tabulated, along with the distributions of phthalate metabolite concentrations and thyroid hormones.",
            "For phthalate metabolite values below the limit of detection (LOD), an imputed value equal to one-half the LOD was used.",
            "Thyroid hormone and phthalate metabolite concentrations were stratified by demographic categories to investigate the potential for confounding.",
            "We used multivariate linear regression to explore relationships between thyroid hormones and urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations.",
            "Concentrations of T4 and T3 closely approximated normality and were used in statistical models untransformed; the distribution of TSH concentration was skewed left and was therefore log-transformed for statistical analyses.",
            "SG-adjusted phthtalate metabolite concentrations were also log-transformed.",
            "Inclusion of covariates was based on statistical and biologic considerations.",
            "Age and body mass index (BMI) were modeled as a continuous variable; smoking status was dichotomized by current smoker versus never smoked or former smoker; and race was categorized into four groups: white, African American, Hispanic, and other.",
            "We considered previous examination for infertility (yes or no), prior impregnation of a partner (yes or no), and timing of blood/urine samples by season (winter vs. spring, summer, or fall) and time of day (0900\u20131259 hours vs. 1300\u20131600 hours) for inclusion in the models as dichotomous variables.",
            "To improve interpretability, the regression coefficients were back transformed and expressed as a change in the dependent variable (i.e., hormone levels) for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in phthalate metabolite concentrations.",
            "For MEHP, we also included MEHHP or MEHP% in the models, in addition to an interaction term, to explore evidence of whether individual differences in DEHP metabolism alter susceptibility to MEHP.",
            "Because, as expected, MEHHP and MEOHP are highly correlated (r = 0.98), the results for models including MEHHP were identical to those with MEOHP and are therefore not presented.",

            "In addition, none of the men reported taking medications that may alter the thyroid axis (i.e., amidoarone, carbamazepine, chlorpropamide, carbidopa/levodopa, heparin, interferon, lithium, phenytoin, phenobarbital, propylthiouracil, sulfasalazine, synthroid).",
            "Among the remaining 408 subjects (Table 1), most were white (85%) and had never smoked (72%).",
            "The mean (\u00b1 SD) age and BMI were 36 \u00b1 5.3 years and 28 \u00b1 4.5, respectively.",
            "Distributions of SG-adjusted phthalate metabolite concentrations are presented in Table 2, and distributions of the thyroid hormones and TSH measured in serum are presented in Table 3.",
            "Among the 408 urine samples, MEP, a metabolite of diethyl phthalate, was detected in 100% of the samples, whereas MBP and MBzP were detected in > 97% and > 94% of the samples, respectively.",
            "Of the samples, 83% had detectable concentrations of MEHP.",
            "The sample size for MEOHP and MEHHP was 208 because analytical methods for the quantification of these analytes were only recently implemented in this study.",
            "More than 95% of these samples had detectable concentrations of MEHHP and MEOHP.",
            "Spearman correlations between MEHP and MEHHP or MEOHP were 0.74 and 0.71, respectively.",
            "Age was inversely associated with both free T4 and total T3 (Spearman correlation coefficients were \u20130.2 and \u20130.1, respectively; p < 0.05 for both), whereas there were suggestive positive weak associations of BMI with T3, TSH, MBzP, and both oxidative DEHP metabolites (all Spearman correlation coefficients were 0.1; all p-values were between 0.05 and 0.1).",
            "Current smokers had higher median T3 levels (1.04 ng/mL) and lower median TSH (1.1 \u03bcIU/mL) than never-smokers (0.96 ng/mL and 1.5 \u03bcIU/mL, respectively).",
            "Smoking status was not associated with T4.",
            "Samples collected in winter had median T4 concentrations slightly lower than those collected in spring, summer, or fall (1.1 vs. 1.2 ng/dL), and median TSH was higher in samples collected in the morning compared with samples collected in the afternoon (1.5 vs. 1.4 \u03bcIU/mL).",
            "For the SG-adjusted phthalate metabolites, current smokers had higher median concentrations of MEP (215 ng/mL) but lower concentrations of MEHHP and MEOHP (21 ng/mL and 16 ng/mL, respectively) compared with never-smokers (140, 45, and 32 ng/mL respectively).",
            "As previously observed, median MEHP concentrations were also higher among men whose urine samples were collected in the afternoon (9.4 ng/mL) compared with men who provided urine samples in the morning (6.9 ng/mL).",
            "Crude regression results were similar to the adjusted results, with the exception of MEP, where there was a suggestive inverse association with total T3 (p = 0.07) and a suggestive positive association with TSH (p = 0.1) that were no longer evident when covariates were included in the models (p = 0.2).",
            "Results from the multivariate regression analyses are presented in Table 4.",
            "All models were adjusted for age, BMI, smoking, and the time of day blood/urine samples were collected.",
            "We found an inverse association between SG-adjusted urinary MEHP concentration and serum total T3 levels, where an IQR increase in MEHP was associated with a 0.021-ng/mL decrease in T3 [95% confidence interval (CI), \u20130.042 to \u20130.001 ng/mL; p = 0.04].",
            "For the median level of T3 (0.96 ng/mL), this represents a 2.2% decrease in T3 for an IQR increase in MEHP (3.16\u201321.3 ng/mL).",
            "In sensitivity analyses, effect estimates from the multivariate models were similar when men with SG outside the acceptable range were excluded (n = 339; results not shown).",

            "For the median T4 level (1.2 ng/dL), this represents a 2.5% decrease in T4 for an IQR increase in MEHP% (6% to 17% MEHP).",
            "When both MEHP% and MEHP were included in the models, the inverse association between MEHP% and T4 remained (Table 5).",
            "When MEHHP and MEHP were both included in the models, T4 was inversely associated with MEHP but positively associated with MEHHP.",
            "There was no evidence of collinearity between MEHP and MEHHP (i.e., the SEs and 95% CIs were not inflated).",
            "Results were identical when MEOHP was included in the models instead of MEHHP (data not shown), because MEHHP and MEOHP concentrations were highly correlated.",
            "Results for T3 followed the same pattern as free T4 when both MEHP and MEHHP were included in the model, although associations were weaker and not statistically significant (Table 5).",
            "We explored the interaction terms (MEHP \u00d7 MEHHP or MEHP \u00d7 MEHP%), but we found no evidence of interaction when these terms were added to the multivariate models.",
            "To assess the robustness of the associations and potential nonlinear relationships, we categorized SG-adjusted phthalate concentrations into quintiles (n = 408).",
            "We found a suggestive inverse trend for MEHP quintiles and T3 (p = 0.07), whereas we unexpectedly found a significant inverse trend for MEHP quintiles and free T4 (p = 0.04).",
            "The regression coefficients for increasing quintiles of MEHP appeared to plateau at quintile 4 (Figures 1 and 2).",
            "Among the subset of men with MEHP oxidative metabolite measures (n = 208), metabolite concentrations were categorized by tertiles because of the smaller sample size.",
            "The tertile analysis resulted in a suggestive inverse trend between MEHP% and free T4 (p = 0.07; Figure 3).",
            "When tertiles of both MEHP and MEHHP were included, there was an inverse association between free T4 and medium and high tertiles of MEHP compared with the lowest MEHP tertile (Figure 4).",
            "Similar to the quintile analysis among all the men, the relationships did not appear to be linear but were suggestive of having a plateau.",
            "Results were similar when MEHP and MEHP% were included in the same model (Figure 5).",
            "In addition, the suggestive association between MEHP% and free T4 was no longer evident.",
            "We compared concentrations of (unadjusted) urinary phthalate metabolites measured in the present study with those among U.S. males published in the Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals.",
            "Metabolite distributions were generally similar between the present study and the national data, although we found slightly lower concentrations of MEP, MBP, and MBzP.",
            "Conversely, urinary concentrations of MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP were somewhat higher in the present study than those from the Third National Report.",
            "For example, the median and 95th percentile values for MEHP (unadjusted for SG) in the present study were 6.3 and 112 ng/mL, respectively, compared with 4.3 and 37.9 ng/mL in the Third National Report.",
            "Discussion",
            "To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the association between environmental exposures to phthalates and serum thyroid hormone and TSH levels in humans.",
            "In the present study, we found evidence for an inverse association between urinary MEHP concentrations comparable with those reported for the general U.S. population, and free T4 and total T3 levels in adult men.",
            "When metabolite concentrations were modeled as continuous variables, there was an inverse association between MEHP and T3.",
            "We also found evidence of a plateau in the inverse association for both T3 and free T4 with MEHP when exposure was categorized by quintiles, suggesting that the relationship is nonlinear; regression approaches that assume linearity may not be appropriate for assessing the relationship between MEHP and thyroid hormones.",
            "Nonmonotonic inverse associations with a plateau or even a U shape may be plausible, as has been demonstrated at low doses for other hormonally active compounds.",
            "The associations between MEHP and thyroid hormones in the present study are somewhat consistent with limited animal studies, in which rats fed DEHP-contaminated diets had histopathologic thyroid changes consistent with hyperactivity and decreased T4 concentrations compared with controls, whereas T3 levels remained essentially unchanged.",
            "Conversely, rats intravenously administered DEHP, at concentrations representing the amount that can leach from polyvinyl chloride blood bags used for human blood transfusions, showed increased serum T3 and T4 levels.",
            "This may suggest differences in DEHP toxicokinetics by route of exposure (ingestion vs. intravenous), although evidence for this has not been shown in other studies to date.",
            "In another study in rats fed a DEHP-contaminated diet (2%) for 21 days, reported no difference in T4 levels between exposed and control groups.",
            "However, serum T4 levels were lower in exposed rats (3.44 \u00b1 0.53 ng/mL) than in controls (4.20 \u00b1 0.58 ng/mL); the lack of statistical significance may have been due to a small number of animals in each group (n = 12 and 7, respectively).",
            "Virtually every tissue in the body is affected by the thyroid hormones, but studies on adverse health effects associated with small deficits of T4 or T3 in humans are currently lacking.",
            "There are a number of potential mechanisms by which environmental chemicals can affect thyroid function and disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis\u2014including involvement of the sodium\u2013iodide symporter, thyroid peroxidase enzyme, receptors for thyroid hormones or TSH, and transport proteins or cellular uptake mechanisms\u2014all of which may interfere with the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013thyroid axis at different levels.",
            "Interaction between environmental chemicals and iodothyronine deiodinases or hepatic enzymes may also influence peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones.",
            "Limited evidence exists that phthalates may be involved in a number of these mechanisms.",
            "Recent in vitro studies suggest that phthalates induce changes in iodide uptake of thyroid follicular cells by altering the transcriptional activity of the sodium\u2013iodide sym-porter.",
            "found that, in birds, phthalates bind competitively to transthyretin, a major thyroid hormone\u2013binding transport protein.",
            "In addition, found that phthalates (DBP and BBzP, but not DEHP) inhibited [125I]T3 uptake in tadpole red blood cells.",
            "Additional research is needed for a better understanding of how phthalates may influence the endocrine system and thyroid function.",
            "Alternatively, at this time we cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causation whereby thyroid status may affect DEHP and/or MEHP metabolism in a manner that results in the observed inverse associations between DEHP metabolites and thyroid hormones.",
            "A limitation of the present study was that we did not measure levels of total T4 and free T3; these measurements, in conjunction with free T4 and total T3 levels, may have provided additional mechanistic insights.",
            "MEHP%, which provides information on the proportion of DEHP excreted in the urine as the monoester compared with the oxidative metabolites but does not provide information on the magnitude of DEHP exposure, was inversely associated with free T4 (Table 4).",
            "In addition, when both MEHP and oxidative metabolites were considered in multivariate models, we found an inverse association between MEHP and free T4 along with evidence of a positive association between MEHHP and free T4 (Table 5, Figure 4).",
            "These results suggest that the efficiency of an individual\u2019s ability to oxidize DEHP to MEHHP and MEOHP may be related to increased circulating free T4 levels.",
            "For instance, for a given urinary concentration of MEHP, an increased urinary concentration of MEHHP or MEOHP was associated with increased circulating free T4. Conversely, for a given urinary concentration of MEHHP or MEOHP, an increased MEHP concentration is associated with decreased free T4.",
            "This phenomenon was also reflected in the inverse association between MEHP% and free T4, where having an increased percentage of total DEHP urinary metabolites excreted as MEHP was associated with decreased T4 levels.",
            "This suggests that for a given concentration of MEHP, the higher the percentage of DEHP excreted as MEHP (i.e., the more MEHP there is relative to MEHHP and MEOHP in the urine), the lower the serum T4.",
            "These results may indicate that the pathways by which DEHP is metabolized may impart variable risks for altered thyroid hormones, based on the proportion of DEHP that undergoes oxidative metabolism compared with the proportion that is excreted as the monoester.",
            "An understanding of the metabolism of DEHP may provide insights into our observations on the relationships between DEHP metabolites and thyroid hormone levels.",
            "DEHP hydrolyzes first to MEHP, which subsequently metabolizes to MEHHP and MEOHP, among other oxidative metabolites.",
            "These DEHP oxidative metabolites are more easily excreted in urine than MEHP.",
            "Therefore, oxidation of MEHP could effectively decrease internal body burden of MEHP, which in turn, may have a protective effect if MEHP is the bioactive metabolite.",
            "DEHP interindividual variability in the percentage of MEHP and of oxidative metabolites that are excreted in the urine has been observed in the present study (Table 2) and elsewhere.",
            "Therefore, because the proportion of urinary excretion of DEHP as MEHP varies across individuals, urinary concentrations of MEHP alone do not represent total body burden of DEHP exposure.",
            "The inclusion of oxidative metabolites such as MEHHP and MEOHP, as shown by our results for free T4, may provide additional insights into DEHP exposure and metabolism.",
            "An alternative explanation is that the relative percentage of DEHP oxidative metabolites in urine may represent a surrogate for the function of phase 1 enzymes.",
            "If other hormonally active chemicals requiring phase 1 enzymes for detoxification are associated with thyroid function or thyroid hormone levels, men with high MEHP%, which represents low functionality of the phase 1 enzymes, may also be \u201cpoor\u201d metabolizers of the other hormonally active chemicals.",
            "Presently, there is no evidence to support this, although it remains a possible alternative explanation.",
            "To our knowledge, other studies have not explored the associations of thyroid hormone levels with urinary phthalate monoester metabolites or with oxidative metabolites of DEHP.",
            "Further investigation is warranted on the association between MEHP and thyroid hormones, and the potential utility of MEHP% as a phenotypic marker of the proportion of DEHP excreted as MEHP and its oxidative metabolites.",
            "As with other phthalates, interindividual variability in DEHP metabolism and urinary excretion of metabolites exists.",
            "Furthermore, the timing of collection of the urine sample may partially account for differences in urinary concentrations of MEHP and the oxidative metabolites among individuals because the oxidative metabolites have a longer half-life than MEHP.",
            "For instance, a urine sample collected a few hours after DEHP exposure would contain primarily MEHP.",
            "By contrast, a urine sample collected 12 hr after DEHP exposure may have higher concentrations of MEHHP and MEOHP than of MEHP.",
            "The differences in half-lives of DEHP metabolites should be taken into account when interpreting the meaning of MEHP% following a single pulsed exposure to DEHP.",
            "However, the interpretation of MEHP% would be more straightforward if the differences in half-lives were not as influential on urinary concentrations, as in the case of chronic exposure to DEHP.",
            "Conclusion",
            "In the present study we found that urinary MEHP concentrations comparable with those found among the general U.S. population may be associated with altered free T4 and/or T3 levels in adult men.",
            "However, this is the first report of these associations in humans; thus, additional research is necessary to substantiate the observed findings.",
            "Future studies must also consider oxidative DEHP metabolites relative to MEHP as a potential marker of metabolic susceptibility to DEHP exposure."

            "The repeated intratracheal instillation of cigarette smoke condensate (SWS) in rats at close to maximum tolerated dose levels failed to induce squamous neoplasms in the lungs although such treatment was associated with an increased incidence of cuboidal/columnar metaplasia (CCM) and squamous metaplasia (Sq.M) of alveolar epithelium.",
            "With one exception, various fractions of SWS had no effect on lung tumour incidence though some were more effective than SWS in increasing the incidence of CCM and Sq.M.",
            "The exceptional fraction, Fraction P, which contains most of the polycyclic aro- matic hydrocarbons of smoke and is the most effective of the fractions tested in producing tumours in mouse skin, gave rise to 4 squamous tumours of doubtful malignancy and one metastasizing squamous carcinoma among 3 groups of 18 animals exposed at 3 different dose levels.",

            "Although studies by Shabad (1962) and Pylev (1963) had suggested that lung tumour production is increased by the inclusion of particulate matter in the instillate, the more recent experiments by Schreiber,  Nettesheim and Martin (1972) and Davis  et al. (1975b) have shown that tumours are readily inducible in the absence of particulate matter and other experiments of our own (unpublished) have shown that the presence of particulate matter such as carbon black may obscure differences in response to the materials being compared.",

            "The average number of puffs required to reach these butt lengths were: T29, 10U8 puffs, T44, 11-3 puffs.",
            "Smoke was collected in a glass trap cooled by immersion in acetone and crushed solid carbon dioxide (see Davies and Day,  1969).",
            "It was stored at -29\u00b0C until used.",
            "A condensate prepared in this way is referred to as \" stale whole-smoke condensate \" (SWS) and is sufficiently fluid when heated to blood temperature to enable it to be drawn into a micrometer syringe for intratracheal instillation.",

            "-The fractions of whole smoke condensate used in these experiments were the polycyclic aro- matic hydrocarbon (PArR) rich materials separated by the application of procedures designed to concentrate them.",

            "The fractions were: Neutral (NF -30% w/w SWS); G (25% SWS); L(G) (7.6%); L (4.6%); (R + P)G (3.2%) and P(SG) (2.3%).",
            "Duration of treatment.",

            "RESULTS",
            "The essential design of the studies is depicted in Table I.",
            "Each material was tested in 3 groups of 12 or 18 rats at 3 different dose levels, there being a two-fold factor between the successive levels.",
            "Three groups were atropinized and anaes- thetized with ether as for intratracheal instillation treatment once fortnightly for 18 treatments (Group 34) or for life (Groups 35 and 36) but given no further treatment.",
            "Five groups (Groups 37-41)   were left untreated.",
            "Table I shows both the actual doses of condensate fractions given each fortnight and the equivalent doses of SWS.",
            "Survival",
            "Table I summarizes the results in respect of survival.",
            "There is a clear trend, irrespective of the identity of the test material, for survival time to be inversely related to dose, the lowest dose having little effect.",
            "However, some of the test materials were more toxic than others.",
            "Thus, 43 mg SWS given fort- nightly proved more toxic than 42 mg Fraction R + P, 44 mg Fraction G, or 48 mg Fraction R + P(G).",
            "In general, treatments that markedly shortened survival also adversely affected body weight.",
            "Other treatments had little or no effect on body weight.",
            "Effect of treatment on mean grade of chronic respiratory disease (CRD)  With one exception, observed mean CRD grades were less than expected in the 8 control groups.",
            "In 3 of these groups the difference was significant (2 at the P < 0-001 level and 1 at P < 0.05).",
            "In groups where treatment stopped after 18 fortnightly instillations, the mean CRD grade also tended to be less than expected (e.g. Groups 1-3, 4-7 and 34), suggesting, as might perhaps have been predicted, that continuing treatment favours higher CRD grade more than discontinuing it.",
            "Significantly higher mean grades of CRD than expected were seen in response to the high doses, and sometimes also to the intermediate doses of several of the fractions.",
            "Fractions L(G), P(SG) and R(G) + P(SG) were notable in this regard.",
            "Effect of treatment on mean grades of cuboidal and columnar metaplasia (CCM) and squamous metaplasia (Sq.M)",
            "Mean grades of CCM and Sq.M were lower than expected in all 8 control groups.",

            "of NF for up to only 18 treatments, the mean CCM grade was significantly lower than expected.",
            "Significantly higher than expected mean grades of CCM and/or Sq.M were seen in animals given the intermediate or higher doses of some of the fractions (see Table II for details).",
            "CCM and Sq.M in rats exposed to SWS or fractions are illustrated in Fig. 1 and2.",
            "The response to Fraction P(SG) (Groups 30, 31 and 33) from T44 cigarettes was notably different from that to any other fractions in 2 respects.",
            "Firstly, at all 3 dose levels observed mean grades of both CCM and Sq.M were highly significantly greater than expected.",
            "Secondly, of the 54 rats in these 3 groups, 5 deve- loped squamous lesions of severity more than Grade 3.",
            "No lesions more severe than Grade 3 were seen in any other group.",
            "Four rats of these 3 groups developed Grade 4 lesions, i.e. squamous tumours of doubtful malignancy and one developed a Grade 6 lesion, which had metastasized to extrathoracic sites (Fig. 3).",
            "Because higher dosage reduced survival, it is not possible to be sure whether the effects of treatment with Fraction P(SG) on CCM or Sq.M lesions was dose related.",
            "When groups treated with low, inter- mediate or high doses of different fractions were combined, it was clear that mean grades of CRD, CCM and Sq.M rose significantly in parallel with dose (see bottom of Table II).",
            "A similar trend was not discernible in the case of SWS treatment but this was probably because the numbers were smaller and survival was very poor in animals given high doses.",
            "Golden-brown pigment-laden macrophages (GBM)",
            "Since the exposure of rats and other species of animals to tobacco smoke by inhalation is associated with the accumu- lation in the lungs of macrophages laden with Golden-brown pigment (GBM) (Davis   et al., 1.975b), it was of interest to see whether the same change occurred in association with the intratracheal instillation of smoke condensate or fractions derived from it.",
            "Accordingly, slides from a few animals of the present experiment were re-examined.",
            "Some showed foci of GBM and some did not.",
            "In no case were GBM lesions as prominient as in the smoke-exposed rats studied by Davis et al.  (1 975c)",
            "However, as in those animals, GBi1 tended to be associated with areas of alveolar metaplasia, either CCM (Fig. 1) or Sq.M.",

            "Observed and expected incidences of extrapulmonary neoplasms were calcu-lated as described in Davis et al. (1975b).",
            "No differences attributable to treatment were seen.",
            "DISCUSSION",
            "Although there is a tendency for all 3 measures of effect (CRD, CCM and Sq.M) to increase with dose, a glance at the results as a whole as shown in Table II suggests that some fractions dispropor- tionately affect CCM and/or Sq.M without having a comparable effect on CRD.",
            "This is true for fractions L, P(G), R(G) + P(SG) and G.",
            "With the exception of Fraction P(SG) from T44 cigarettes, none ofthe treatments given produced lung tumours of the kinds seen in animals given repeated intra- tracheal instillations of 3,4-benzpyrene (see Davis et al., 1975b).",

            "7 5-30 mg Fraction P(SG) is equivalent to 915-3659 rmg SWS or to the particulate matter from approximately 40-160 cigarettes.",
            "The particular rat which developed a metastasizing squamous tumour in response to treatment with Fraction P(SG) from T44 cigarettes had received 64 treatments bv the time it was killed during the 128th week of the experiment.",
            "The Fractioni P it received was prepared by fractionating condensate derived from about 18,000 cigarettes.",
            "It is of interest to compare the response of rats to intratracheal instilla- tion of SWS, neutral fraction of Fractions G, P(SG), L(G) or R(G) + P(SG) to that of mnice exposed to the same materials by repeated application to the skin.",
            "From results of mouse skin studies by Rothwell   and Whitehead (personal communication), we would have predicted, if mouise skin activity were relevant to the response of rats to intratracheal instillation, that the groups given Fraction P(SG) of T44 would show the greatest activity just ahead of the 2 sets of groups given Fraction R(G) + P(SG), followed by the group given Fraction P(SG) of T29.",
            "Fraction P(SG) of T44 was the only group to show s(luamotus lesions of Grade 3 or over, so to some extent the results seem encouraging.",
            "However, there were various inconsistencies, e.g. the top dose levels of Fraction R(G) + P(SG) contained more mouse skin active material than the middle dose of Fraction P(SG) of T44.",
            "It is clear that more data are needed to clarify the issue.",
            "Our results suggest that for CCM and Sq.M the magnitude of the response is determined mainly by the amount of material instilled and only to a small extent by differences in mouse skin tumorigenicity.",
            "For CRD the response seems wholly determined by the amount instilled.",
            "The fact that no lung tumours arose in response to repeated intratracheal instilla- tion of SWS at close to maximum tolerated doses provided no encouragement for the view that it might be possible to compare condensates derived from different tobaccos for carcinogenicity by the intratracheal intillation method in rats.",
            "However, the comparison of fractions seems still to remain a feasible proposition.",
            "The failure to produce squamous neoplasms by fractions other than fraction P(SG) may well be due to the relative infrequency of treatments given in these experiments, particularly when the effi- ciency of the clearance mechanisms for foreign material from the lungs is con- sidered.",
            "Recent experiments have shown that it is possible to treat rats with up to 24 mg/dose (equivalent 833 mg SWS) of Fraction (R + P)G as frequently as 3 times a week over several months without any large loss due to toxicity.",
            "In an earlier paper in the series, Davis et al. (1975b) compared the response of rats to the repeated intratracheal instilla- tion of BP in infusine alone and BP in infusine and carbon black.",
            "In terms of tumour incidence, the addition of carbon black was without obvious effect although previous studies by Shabad and his colleagues (Shabad, 1962; Pylev, 1963)  suggested that it would boost tumour development.",
            "In a parallel study in which we gave 378 rats smoke condensate or fractions of it in I + CB rather than in I, we found no more squamous neoplasms (about 3%) than in 36 rats given I + CB only.",
            "However, the presence in the lung of large numbers of carbon black particles rendered the histopathological assessment of lung changes difficult.",
            "We conclude that the addition of CB offers no advan- tage in the comparisons of materials administered by the endotracheal route.",

            "The methylation status of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was determined via qMSP reactions using DNA samples derived from blood leucocytes of 347 nurses and midwives working rotating nights and 363 working during the days.",
            "The subjects were classified into unmethylated vs methylated BRCA1 and BRCA2 when the methylation index was 0% or >0%, respectively.",
            "The adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for night work status, smoking, obesity, physical activity and alcohol drinking.",
            "Current night shift work or night work history was not associated with methylation status of the promoter sites within BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.",
            "We observed weak associations between smoking and the methylation status of BRCA1 with OR = 1.50 (95%CI: 0.98\u20132.29) for current smoking, OR = 1.83, 95CI: 1.08\u20133.13 for smoking longer than 31 years, and 0.1>p>0.05 for trends for the number of cigarettes per day, smoking duration and packyears.",
            "In conclusion, no links between night shift work and methylation of the promoter region within the BRCA1, and BRCA2 genes were observed in this exploratory analysis.",
            "The findings of our study weakly support the hypothesis that smoking may contribute to epigenetic events.",
            "Introduction",
            "Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide.",
            "The etiology of breast cancer has not been fully explained; however, both the genetic and environmental factors are postulated to be playing a role.",
            "Of the genetic factors, the inherited germline mutations in two genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2, are the well-established risk factors of breast cancer, explaining approximately two percent of breast cancer cases (up to 7 percent among Polish women diagnosed before age 50).",
            "These two tumor suppressor genes are involved in genome stability, DNA repair and cell cycle control.",
            "Of the modifiable risk factors, obesity after menopause and alcohol drinking have been recognized as potentially contributing to breast cancer, while physical activity has been proven to play some part in reducing breast cancer risk.",
            "Epidemiological evidence has also implied a potentially causative role of active smoking, particularly long-term heavy smoking, and when initiated before first birth.",
            "One of the occupational exposures that have been classified as probably carcinogenic is the shift work leading to circadian rhythm disruption.",
            "A number of epidemiological studies were focused on a possible association between night shift work and breast cancer risk.",
            "The meta-analysis based on 12 case-control studies reported a 9% increase in the risk of breast cancer per 5 years of night work.",
            "However, no increased risk of breast cancer was observed in the some recent prospective cohort studies.",
            "Thus the link between night shift work and breast cancer risk still remains disputable.",
            "One of the proposed mechanisms underlying the increased risk of breast cancer among night shift workers is a decrease in melatonin synthesis and an increase in reproductive hormones synthesis in response to light-at-night.",
            "It has also been postulated that shift work may contribute to unhealthy changes in lifestyle, such as more common smoking and alcohol consumption as well as lower physical activity and poor dietary habits, which may increase cancer risk.",
            "Moreover, night workers were found to be more likely to become obese than day workers.",
            "Although the idea of shift work as being probably carcinogenic to humans is gaining widespread attention, there is a lack of experimental mechanistic evidence linking shift work to breast cancer.",
            "Moreover, the biological and molecular mechanisms of shift work exposure have not been fully explored.",
            "Only recently have some in vivo animal models of human shift work been used to investigate the possible association between shift work and adverse health effects.",
            "Epigenetic changes in the genome have been proposed as one of the biologically plausible mechanisms.",
            "A major epigenetic mechanism that may affect gene expression in the disease is the changes in the methylation level of 5-methylcytosine (5meC) in the regulatory regions (i.e. promoter, enhancer) of the genes.",
            "This may lead to an altered transcription of the regulatory genes, which can result in malignant cellular transformation.",
            "Several studies have already investigated genome-wide CpG island methylation of the protein-coding genes and the regulatory microRNA (miRNA) genes Wee EJ, Peters K, Nair SS, Hulf T, Stein S, Wagner S, Bailey P, Lee SY, Qu WJ, Brewster B, et al.

            "Their findings suggest that a long-term night shift work exposure may lead to methylation-dependent downregulation of the protein-coding genes and miRNA genes, which in turn may lead to the downregulation of several biological pathways that are important in breast carcinogenesis, such as DNA damage response and repair, oxidative stress response, inflammation, and immunomediated antitumor activity.",
            "Changes in promoter methylation in the CLOCK gene were also reported among long-term shift workers, which was consistent with the findings on a low level of the CLOCK methylation in breast cancer patients.",
            "In vitro assays displayed a network of transcripts with an altered expression following CLOCK or CRY2 gene knockdown, including the genes involved in breast carcinogenesis.",
            "The evidence for the role of environmental and lifestyle factors in DNA methylation has been mounting.",
            "Changes in the methylation pattern of the promoter within tumor suppressor genes have also been observed, with suggestive evidence supporting the hypothesis that not only the inherited mutations in the genes, but also their functional inactivation caused by the epigenetic events such as hypermethylation i.e. aberrant methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter region, may play a role in the etiology of breast cancer.",
            "Some evidence points out that the epigenetic regulation of the BRCA1 gene may contribute to breast cancer risk.",
            "Therefore, we hypothesized that the rotating night work and such modifiable factors as cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, and obesity, may be associated with the methylation of the promoter regions within two tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2.",
            "To examine this hypothesis, we investigated associations between the methylation status of the CpG island in the promoter of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and the lifestyle factors, using data obtained from a cross-sectional study on nurses and midwives.",
            "Material and methods",
            "This cross-sectional study was described elsewhere.",
            "In short, the study included 725 nurses and midwives (84% of those eligible), aged 40\u201360 years, who were employed as a nurse or midwife in public health care settings in Lodz, Poland.",

            "The nurses currently working night shifts (n = 347) were employed according to the fast rotating system (12 h long shifts), with a night shift followed by a day off.",
            "Night duties started at 7 p.m. and ended at 7:00 a.m. while day shifts started at 7 a.m. and ended at 7 p.m., with no evening shifts.",
            "There were no permanent night workers in the study population.",
            "Day workers (n = 363) worked mostly in the outpatient clinics and the shift usually lasted 7.5 hours, between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m.",
            "Among the subjects currently working day shifts, the majority had some history of night shift work, but most of them (83%) had resigned from night shifts more than five years before the onset of the present study.",
            "A structured questionnaire was administered during in-person interviews that were carried out during the years 2008\u20132010, to elicit information on occupational history, demographics, medical and reproductive history, hormone use, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, and diet; the latter based on the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).",
            "Questions were asked about current cigarette smoking, and the amounts smoked within 5 years prior to the project; with the age categories starting at age <15 years.",
            "With regard to alcohol consumption, we asked questions about the number of glasses of beer (0.5 l), wine (100ml) or vodka (50ml) drunk on average per day (week, month or year) over the period of the preceding year, and we also asked about the number of alcoholic beverages drunk on average, by the age categories starting from the age of 15\u201317 years.",
            "Anthropometric measurements of body weight, height, waist and hip circumference were performed by trained nurses, and body mass index (BMI in kg/m2), and waist to hip ratio (WHR) were calculated.",

            "The details were described previously.",
            "Based on the IPAQ guidelines, we calculated the MET-hours per week (MET\u2014metabolic equivalent ratio of the metabolic rate to a standard resting metabolic rate of 1) for each category of physical activity.",
            "The total physical activity was calculated by summing the scores for all the four domains.",

            "The study included roughly equal proportions of nurses currently working according to rotating night system or on day shifts (49% vs 51%).",
            "There was a high rate (49%) of subjects with a long lifetime duration of night work (>20 years) in the total population (80.4% among night shift workers and 18.5% among current day workers).",
            "As much as 30.6% of the subjects reported current smoking, while 42.5% had never smoked, and 27% were ex-smokers.",
            "Of the current smokers, roughly 41% smoked more than 15 cigarettes per day, and the majority (78%) were long-term smokers (>20 years).",
            "The subjects generally reported drinking small amounts of alcohol, with an average of 0.6 drinks per week, and 5% reported current abstinence.",
            "As much as 63% of the subjects were overweight or obese (BMI>25), and abdominal obesity (WHR.0.85) was observed among 25% of the subjects.",
            "About 28% reported no leisure-time physical activity, while their total physical activity was high (221 MET*hr per week).",
            "In most of the women studied, the promoter regions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were unmethylated (78% and 82%, respectively).",
            "The subjects\u2019 characteristics according to the current work system are provided in S1 Table.",
            "Current night workers were on average two years younger than current day workers (p<0.001).",
            "As many as 80% of current night workers reported more than 20 years of night work (vs. 19% among current day workers), while 49% of day workers reported night work of up to 10 years (vs 3% of current night workers).",
            "More current night workers than day workers reported current smoking (34.6% vs. 26.7% respectively), with higher frequency of smokers, who smoked for 20 years or longer among ever smokers (82.6% vs 73.0%), and higher number of the packyears (9.9 vs 8.5, p = 0.007).",
            "The total physical activity was higher among night workers (241 vs. 202 MET*hr per week, p<0.001), and recreational physical inactivity was more common among night workers(p = 0.02).",
            "Neither the current night work status nor night work duration showed any association with the methylation status of the promoter site in the BRCA1 gene (Table 2).",
            "Of the lifestyle factors, smoking was found to be significantly associated with BRCA1 methylation, with OR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.00\u20132.30 among current smokers compared to never-smokers.",

            "The relationship between the the number of packyears and the methylation of the promoter of BRCA1 was slightly weaker, with the OR = 1.55, 95%CI:0.97\u20132.47 for the highest tertile and p for trend of 0.082.",
            "BMI and other anthropometric measures were not associated with the methylation status of the BRCA1 gene.",
            "Neither night work nor smoking or alcohol drinking showed any association with the methylation status of the BRCA2 gene (Table 3).",
            "Likewise, no effect for the methylation status of BRCA2 could be noted for obesity or physical inactivity in the total study population.",
            "Discussion",
            "In the reported cross-sectional study of nurses and midwives, we examined several determinants of the methylation status in two suppressor genes, namely BRCA1 and BRCA2, whose silencing predisposes to breast cancer.",
            "We sought associations for the rotating night work, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and two anthropometric measures: BMI and WHR.",
            "The study found no associations for rotating night shift while suggested a positive association between the methylation status of the BRCA1 gene and current smoking, particularly among moderate smokers (5\u201314 cigarettes per day), and long term smokers (>31 years).",
            "No other significant associations were noted.",
            "Although the research concerning the epigenetic effects of smoking, mostly in the context of cancer (e.g. lung cancer for which smoking is a strong risk factor), has been relatively abundant, we were able to identify only a few studies focused on associations between smoking and the methylation status within the promoter regions of BRCA1, and in fact none for BRCA2.",
            "In a recent study conducted among monozygotic twins (21 couples) with discordant smoking habits, no significant difference in the methylation status of the promoter site of BRCA1 was noted between smokers and nonsmokers.",
            "The odds ratio of BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was increased among the subjects who smoked for more than 10 years (OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 0.09\u201331.9) but the result was insignificant.",
            "The study was limited by its relatively small population size, including mostly light smokers (<15 cigarettes per day) with a short duration of the smoking habit (mean 10 years).",
            "In another study, neither active smoking (current or ever) nor passive smoking was related to the methylation status within the promoter site of BRCA1 when measured in tumor tissue from breast cancer cases.",
            "A number of epigenome-wide studies reported differential methylation of various loci across genome between smokers and non-smokers, although none of them identified statistically significant variability in the methylation pattern by the smoking status for the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.",
            "The analyses of data from the genome-wide studies imply strong thresholds for significance; thus smaller effects may be excluded from being quantified.",
            "For instance, these studies did not find associations for smoking and methylation in the promoter region of another suppressor gene\u2013CDKN2A (p16), while a meta-analysis of 19 epidemiological studies using the candidate genes approach demonstrated a higher frequency of the p16 gene hypermethylation in smoking vs non-smoking patients in tumor tissues of patients with diagnosed non-small cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.25, 95%CI:1.81\u20132.80).",
            "The biological mechanism explaining the relations between smoking and epigenetic effects in particular gene-specific hypo- or hypermethylation remains unclear.",
            "Several mechanisms were postulated, mostly related to the activity of DNA methyltransferases, the enzymes responsible for DNA methylation.",
            "The carcinogens contained in cigarette smoke, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chromium and formaldehyde, are well known to generate DNA damage including double-strand breaks.",
            "It was also shown that the DNA repair sites recruit DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), resulting in the methylation of the repaired DNA fragments.",
            "Also cadmium, contained in cigarette smoke, was demonstrated to alter DNA methylation pattern through cadmium-mediated overexpression of DNMT3B with concomitant hypermethylation of the tumor suppressor genes p16 and RASSF1A.",
            "Changes in DNA methylation were related to histone modification caused by cigarette smoking, which correlated with decreased DNMT1 and increased DNMT3B expression along with hypomethylation of repetitive DNA sequences and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes RASSF1A and RARB.",
            "The epidemiological data regarding other environmental determinants of the epigenetic events in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been sparse and inconclusive thus far.",
            "To our knowledge, no previous study that focused on these two genes examined the possible associations with night work.",
            "Two broad studies on epigenome investigated associations for the night work, but only the latter reported findings for the BRCA1 gene.",
            "In this study, as much as 65% of the investigated sites showed hypomethylation in night workers compared to day workers.",
            "The hypomethylation referred to the sites (cytosines) within the BRCA1 gene (both within the promoter region and the gene body).",
            "This was the only study that showed that night shift work is associated with hypomethylation in the investigated genomic DNA, while in other studies in this field, both hypo- and hypermethylation was observed, depending on the gene or the gene region studied.",
            "We found no significant associations between BMI or WHR and the BRCA1 or BRCA2 methylation status in the total study population.",
            "In one previous report, BMI was significantly associated with methylation in the BRCA1 gene determined in DNA extracted from breast tumor tissue.",
            "This observation has not been supported by two other studies that investigated the methylation pattern of BRCA1 besides other cancer-related genes in breast tumor tissue.",
            "The inconsistency of the findings may be explained by a possible mismatch of loci within the BRCA1 gene that were examined in each of these studies, as suggested by McCullough et al..",
            "An epigenome-wide association study of the methylation pattern of DNA deriving from peripheral white blood cells did not report inferences between BMI and the methylation pattern in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.",
            "We also did not find associations between the methylation status of both the examined genes and the physical activity in the total study population.",
            "Previous research demonstrated that physical activity may be associated with a \u201chealthier methylation profile\u201d.",
            "As far as we know, there was only one study addressing this specific association for the genes we investigated.",
            "The intervention trial examined methylation level across 45 sites within a panel of 21 breast cancer-related genes (including 4 sites in BRCA1 and 1 site in BRCA2).",
            "This study demonstrated lower levels of methylation among individuals who exercised more minutes per week and also among those who increased their physical activity during 12 months of the trial.",
            "The most recent review evaluated data from 25 studies (both observational and intervention based) addressing association between physical activity and methylation pattern.",
            "The authors concluded that both acute and chronic exercising significantly influence DNA methylation.",
            "The biological mechanisms of the process remain to be elucidated.",
            "In our study we analyzed the main effect of the factors on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes methylation with two models.",
            "The comparison of results from these two models showed no substantial differences, hence no strong confounding was detected.",
            "The present project was a pioneer study in the field of epigenetics within two important breast cancer-related genes as analyzed by night shift work, thus contributing to the sparse epidemiological data about inferences for modifiable lifestyle factors, and this can be regarded as one of its strong points.",
            "The size of the study population was relatively large when compared to other cross-sectional studies searching for mechanistic explanation of increased breast cancer risk among night shift workers.",
            "We also obtained detailed exposure data through in-person interviews and anthropometric measurements.",
            "The analyses were focused and respective hypotheses were formulated.",
            "The qMSP used for determining the BRCA1 and BRCA2 methylation patterns bears a high degree of sensitivity.",
            "This highly quantitative technique can accurately determine the relative prevalence of a particular pattern of CpG dinucleotides methylation.",
            "There are also several limitations to consider.",
            "The conclusions regarding occupational exposure are confined to the rotating night shift work, therefore the results cannot be generalized to other shift work systems.",
            "The part of analysis referring to alcohol consumption was limited by the fact that in the population we studied, the level of alcohol consumption was generally low.",
            "Only 6 women reported having more than 5 drinks per week.",
            "Thus we were not able to examine associations for heavy drinkers.",
            "Even though the total study population was relatively large, the number of subjects in specific categories in some instances was rather small (below 10).",
            "This resulted in wide confidence intervals, which was the case e.g. for the shortest duration of night work history among current night workers (<10 years), light current smokers (1\u20134 cigarettes per day), or ever-smokers with a shorter smoking duration (<10 years).",
            "In the analysis, we included the age and folate intake and other lifestyle characteristics that were considered in this study.",
            "While we could not rule out some confounding by other factors, we are not aware of any strong determinants of de novo methylation in BRCA1 or BRCA2.",
            "Apart from the limitations mentioned above, the utility of peripheral blood for the assessment of associations between the risk factors and methylation alterations in genomic DNA may have had impact, given that the sample does not directly reflect the target tissue, as it has been indicated for human blood and brain using 450K Human Methylation array.",
            "On the other hand, 4 of 8 investigated CpG loci showed a good correlation between blood and buccal cells in DNA methylation patterns.",
            "There are only a few studies that focus on the potential reflection of the epigenetic status in DNA from the surrogate tissues compared with DNA from breast tumor or normal tissue.",
            "Fu et al and Sharma et al noted a concordance between tumor DNA methylation in breast cancer patients and paired serum or plasma DNA methylation of multiple cancer genes.",
            "These findings indicate that particular DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood cells may be useful for predicting breast cancer risk.",
            "However, no correlation was found between white blood cell DNA and normal breast epithelial cell DNA methylation of RASSF1 tumor suppressor gene and repetitive elements in healthy women undergoing reduction mammoplasty.",
            "It has also been postulated that breast cancer treatment may potentially affect DNA methylation which would imply that the epigenetic analyses should ideally be conducted in untreated patients.",
            "Nevertheless, blood-derived DNA methylation seems to be a promising epigenetic indicator in breast cancer investigations.",
            "In a recent systematic review, a possibility of using blood-derived DNA methylation features (global methylation or gene-specific methylation) for breast cancer stratification was suggested.",
            "The most frequently investigated gene in whole blood was BRCA1, which presented a higher methylation status in the promoter region in patients compared to controls.",
            "Of concern is also that DNA methylation may vary depending on the white blood cell type.",
            "Tissue-specific methylation patterns are established through a combination of demethylation and de novo methylation reactions.",
            "Tissue specificity may be due to the differences in specific DNA binding proteins that bind to methylated and unmethylated DNA, and the availability of DNA methylase, all of which may play a role in the extent of de novo methylation or demethylation.",
            "Using the total population of mono- and polymorphonuclear white blood cells for DNA isolation may affect the methylation pattern of the genes.",
            "However, it has been shown that the majority of CpG loci tested presented stable methylation over a long time (11\u201320 years) in DNA isolated from blood taken at two time points, despite the possible changes in the cellular morphology of blood.",
            "Thus considering the absence of temporal variation in the methylation pattern, we are of the opinion that specific gene-methylation can be reliably assessed using one blood sample.",
            "Another limitation refers to the methodology for determining the methylation status.",
            "We did not examine all the epigenetic events in the CpG island within the whole promoter region, but only the 11CpG dinucleotides in BRCA1 and 10 in BRCA2.",
            "The question also arises whether the storage time may affect the methylation pattern.",
            "It has recently been shown that most of the storage conditions for blood specimens have no effect on DNA integrity and methylation.",
            "Thus it seems reasonable that the covalent binding of a methyl group to cytosines in gDNA samples obtained from venous blood and preserved for 6\u20137 years, since 2008 were not affected by the storage period.",
            "One of the mechanisms that may have influence on the stability of the methylation patterns is the formation of oxidative DNA bases such as 8-oxo-guanine, which is present in the CpG dinucleotides.",
            "However, the rate of formation of this modified base in sub-freezing temperatures used for the storage of blood samples is negligible.",
            "In conclusion, our study did not detect associations between the methylation index within the promoter sites of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and the rotating night shift work.",
            "The results of our research indicate that smoking may be one of the environmental determinants of the methylation status of the promoter region in the BRCA1 gene.",
            "Given the novelty of these findings, and limitations resulting from the relatively small number of subjects in subgroup analyses further validation research is warranted."

            "In addition, autoradiographic evidence indicates that the Iype II cell is the progenitor cell for the Type I epithelium in the developing lung (3).",
            "Although Type II cell function is of fundamental importance to the well-being of the organism, very little is known about the pathobiology of the Type II cell.",
            "Very few studies have examined Lype II cell function under conditions of naturally occurring or chemically in- duced lung disease.",
            "Perturbations of the surfactant system accompany a number of human respiratory con- ditions, including the neonatal and adult respiratory distress syndromes (4,5), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (6), and alveolar proteinosis (7,8), but the causes of the surfactant abnormalities and their relationship to the progression of disease have not been delineated.",
            "In ad- dition, in experimental animals, alterations in surfactant levels have been reported following exposure of the lung to a variety of chemical and physical agents, suggesting that Type II cells and the surfactant system may be im- portant components in the response ofthe lung to irnury.",
            "Our laboratoryisinterested inthe mechanisms through which toxic agents influence the pulmonary surfactant system.",
            "Of the many agents reported to affect the sur- factant system, perhaps the most potent is silica.",
            "The increases in surfactant that occur in response to silica deposition in the lung have been well documented (9)(10)(11)(12), and recently we have extended those studies to the cellular level in an attempt to understand the underlying mechanisms through which silica is acting.",
            "In this review we will discuss our recent findings concerning the effects of pulmonary toxicants on the Type II cell population.",
            "Our major focus will be the changes in Type II cells caused by silica and how those changes may account for the increased levels of surfactant phospholipids found in the lungs of silica-exposed rats.",
            "However, we emphasize that, while the response of the surfactant system to silica has been the most wellstudied example of surfactant changes in chemical- induced lung injury, it is probable that many other com- pounds could act through similar mechanisms.",

            "Details of the follow-up achieved at individual companies are given in table 1.",
            "The personnel records held by company D often lacked important items of information , and as a co nsequence the proportion of its employees excluded fro m the analysis or untraced was mu ch higher th an elsewhere.",

            "A total of 2 458 subjects worked in exposed occupations for at least 12 months, and 3 494 were at some time employed in jobs with high exposure.",
            "At the companies where the follow-up was reasonably complete (A-C, E-H), the overall mortality was less than that of the national population (637 deaths observed , 768.8 expected) as was mortality from cancer (167 deaths observed, 208.1 expected) and from the other major disease categories (table 3).",
            "The findings for company D were similar, apart from a small and statistically nonsignificant excess of death s due to digestive disease (5 deaths observed, 1.6 expected).",

            "The death rates from bro nchial carcinoma were the highest for subjects with mode rate and high exposur e to styrene, although the dose-response relationship was not entirely consistent (table 5).",
            "The raised rate was concentrated particularly among workers with one to nine years of employment in an exposed jo b (table 6).",
            "Among subjects exposed for ten or more years, there was no excess.",
            "Nor did the rates of lung cancer increase with time since first exposure (table 7).",

            "When the expected mortality rates were corrected by the 1968-1978 standardized mortality ratios for lung cancer in the local authority areas in which each factory was situated , the total numb er of expected lung cancer deaths was virtually unchan ged at 80.0.",
            "Deaths from lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia all occurred less frequently than expected (table 4).",
            "Altogether six subjects died from lymphoid and hemopoietic malignancies.",
            "In addition, a further eight such cancers were registered among members of the cohort who were still alive at the end of the follow-up period or who had died from other causes.",
            "If these cases are added to the six deaths, the total is still less than the 14.9 deaths expected.",
            "Only one of the six observed deaths occurred in a subject with high exposure to styrene -a hand laminator from Company D who died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",
            "Discussion",
            "This mortality study is statistically more powerful than previously reported surveys of styrene workers, with more than 200 deaths expected among the highly exposed group of hand laminators.",
            "Our estimates of the exposure levels associated with this occupation were based upon measurements made since 1975 at five of the eight factories studied, and they are in broad agreement with those which have been found in similar 2 circumstances by other investigators (10,12,13,15).",
            "There is no reason to believe that work conditions were better in the earlier years of the study period or at the factories for which no hygiene data were available.",
            "A possible weakness of the investigation is the incomplete follow-up achieved, particularly at factory D.",
            "This failure was due largely to deficiencies in records made at the time of employment -for example omission of full first names or date of birth -and as such is unlikely to have been biased in respect of subsequent mortality.",
            "Nevertheless, we felt it safer to analyze the results for factory D separately.",
            "Of the 7 376 subjects from the other seven companies, 96.7 % were both traced and suitable for analysis.",
            "The death rates of the cohort were lower than those of the national population for all the major disease categories, including cancer.",
            "This deficit probably reflects a healthy worker effect, although there was little increase in the standardized mortality ratios when allowance was made for a latency of 10 or 20 years from first exposure to styrene.",
            "Our a priori suspicions of carcinogenicity centered on the risk of lymphoma and leukemia suggested by   ------------ earlier studies, but in our cohort there were fewer deaths than expected from lymphoid and hemopoietic malignancy.",
            "Nor were these cancers concentrated among subjects with the longest and highest exposure to styrene.",
            "A precise analysis of cancer incidence (as opposed to mortality) was not possible because of the incompleteness of cancer registration in England and Wales, especially during the early years of the study period.",
            "However, if the known occurrences of lym-phoma and leukemia among living subjects and subjects who died from other diseases are added to the deaths caused by these tumors, the count of cases still falls short of the number of deaths expected in the cohort.",
            "The apparent discrepancy between this finding and the positive results of some previous studies may be a chance effect, but it could also be due to unrecognized confounding exposures in the chemical and plastics industries.",
            "In the only other reported survey of mortality among glass-reinforced plastics workers (10), no cases of lymphoma or leukemia were found.",
            "As might be expected, several cancers showed standardized mortality ratios that were greater than 100, but in no instance was the excess mortality statistically significant at a 5 070 level.",
            "Only two of the observed associations were based on more than three deaths.",
            "Four subjects died from ovarian cancer when 2.7 deaths would have been expected.",
            "However, two of these women had only background exposure to styrene, and a third had been exposed for less than a year.",
            "Of more interest is the excess mortality attributed to bronchial carcinoma.",
            "At companies where followup was acceptably complete, there were 83 deaths from lung tumors, the standardized mortality ratio being 112.",
            "The excess was apparent at five of the factories studied (A, B, C, E, and H) and could not be explained by concomitant exposure to asbestos, which was confined to factories C and F. Unfortunately, no data were available on the smoking habits of the study population, and interpretation must therefore be speculative.",
            "It is worth noting, however, that the mortality of the cohort from respiratory disease was well below that of the national population.",
            "This finding suggests that the smoking rates were not excessively high.",
            "Analysis by level of exposure to styrene gave some indication of a dose-response relationship, but against this evidence must be weighed the lack of an increase in mortality with time since first exposure and the absence of a risk of lung cancer in most previous studies of styrene workers (1, 2,6,7,11).",
            "An increased rate of lung tumors has been reported in one other investigation -a study of boatbuilders using glass-reinforced plastics in the United States -but it was statistically nonsignificant and limited to subjects with minimal styrene exposure (10).",
            "On balance it seems unlikely that styrene is a cause of lung cancer.",
            "If the excess mortality from the tumor did not occur by chance, it is probably due to a confounding exposure in the glass-reinforced plastics industry.",
            "From the limited range of agents encountered in the production of glass-reinforced plastics, perhaps the most likely candidate would be glass fiber dust.",
            "On the other hand, no clear excess of lung cancer has been demonstrated in studies of glass wool manufacturers (14).",
            "Further follow-up of the cohort may clarify the picture.",
            "The findings of this survey are broadly reassuring.",
            "In a substantial group of workers, many with high exposure to styrene, we found no overall excess of mortality from cancer and, more specifically, a deficit of deaths due to lymphoma and leukemia.",
            "However, although larger than previous investigations, the study had only limited power to detect cancers with a long latency.",
            "After allowance for a latency period of 20 years from first exposure only five cancer deaths would have been expected among the hand laminators exposed to styrene for at least 12 months.",
            "The carcinogenicity of styrene is thus still in question.",

            "In Zapolyarny, residents of 54 buildings were invited from four out of eight zones.",
            "This method of sampling was judged as not giving any selection bias because housing con- ditions are very homogenous throughout both cities and the city areas are too small to be subject to any important concentra- tion gradient for pollution.",
            "Because of previous Russian experiences that yielded low response rates when invitations were given by mail, all participants were invited personally by two trained field workers.",
            "In this way, all residents of each sampled apart- ment building were registered; thus, it was possible to calculate correct response rates.",

            "Stratified analyses comparing all areas with S0r-Varanger were done according to the Mantel-Haenszel method (12).",
            "The relative risks obtained were defined as the probability of having an elevated nickel concentration in the actual population divided by the same probability in the S0r-Varanger population.",
            "The differ- ences between the study groups were statis- tically significant if the 95% confidence limits did not indude the number 1.",
            "We also used the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare groups with regard to urinary nickel and tap water nickel.",
            "Results",
            "Urinary nickel concentrations differed greatly between the Norwegian and Russian populations, although the differences were far less pronounced within each country (Table 2).",
            "Residents of Nikel had the highest concentrations, with a mean and median of 4.9 pg/l and 3.4 pg/I, respectively, fol- lowed by Umba, Zapolyarny, and Apatity.",
            "The lowest concentrations were found in S0r-Varanger, with a mean and median of 0.9 jig/l and 0.6 jig/l, respectively.",
            "Because of the skewed nickel distribution, frequency analysis was employed using a cut-off value of 2.5 jig/I.",
            "While only 5.9% of the S0r-Varanger samples had values above this cut-off, 66% of Nikel residents had urinary concentrations above 2.5 pg/l (Table 2).",
            "The urinary nickel dis- tribution of each study population is shown in Figure 3A.",
            "In the following text, we use \"elevated nickel concentration\" to refer to urinary concentrations above the cut-off value of 2.5 pg/l.",
            "There is no obvi- ous best choice for a cut-off value in this setting because there are striking differ- ences in nickel distributions between the study populations.",
            "The selection of 2.5 pg/I, however, provides us with a sufficient number of cases in S0r-Varanger for meaningful comparative analyses.",
            "With S0r-Varanger as the reference pop- ulation, relative risks of elevated nickel con- centrations adjusted for sex and age were calculated for each of the other populations (Table 2).",
            "All the Russian populations had markedly higher risks than the S0r-Varanger population.",
            "Living in Nikel, for instance, implied an 11-fold excess risk of elevated urinary nickel.",
            "The Norwegian Troms0 comparison group also exhibited a higher risk than S0r-Varanger residents (relative risk 1.5), although this difference was not significant.",
            "Using the Wilcoxon rank sum Volume 106, Number 8, August 1998 * Environmental Health Perspectives  test, however, the difference reached signifi- cance (p<0.001) (Table 2).",
            "Employing the same test, the study group in Nikel had significantly higher urinary nickel levels than the residents of both Zapolyarny and Apatity, but not Umba.",
            "The small number examined in Umba (n = 20) makes the results more susceptible to chance variations and reduces the statistical power.",
            "All possi- ble comparisons between Norwegian and Russian study groups showed significantly higher nickel concentrations in Russia (Wilcoxon rank sum test; p<0.001).",
            "Dilution adjustments.",
            "Adjustments of the nickel values for urinary creatinine caused some alterations in the ranking of the study populations (Fig. 3B).",
            "Nikel resi- dents still had significantly higher nickel values than individuals living in the other study areas (Wilcoxon rank sum tests; p<0.001), but Nikel was now followed by Apatity, Zapolyarny, and Umba in the given sequence.",
            "All Russian areas had sig- nificantly higher adjusted nickel levels than the Norwegian areas, except for Troms0 versus Umba.",
            "Sex and age diferences.",
            "No significant difference was found between men and women with regard to distribution of nickel concentration below and above 2.5 pg/i after adjustment was made for place of resi- dence.",
            "The distribution of median nickel concentrations in different age groups is shown in Figure 4 for men and women sep- arately for all study populations except Umba because of the low number of participants.",
            "Urinary nickel tended to decrease with increasing age.",
            "Separate x2 tests for trend showed a significant age-related decrease in S0r-Varanger (p = 0.01), Troms0   (p = 0.01), and Nikel (p = 0.02) but not in Zapolyarny (p = 0.24) or Apatity (p = 0.44).",
            "Occupational exposure.",
            "The relation- ship between occupation and urinary nick- el concentrations was studied in the popu- lations of Nikel and Zapolyarny, where 17.2% and 15.2% of the participants, respectively, were occupationally exposed according to our classification.",
            "Results are given in Table 3.",
            "Because high urinary nickel levels can be expected in people with an occupational exposure (13)(14)(15), a cut- off value of 10 pg/I was chosen for the fre- quency analysis instead of 2.5 pg/i.",
            "With this cut-off, nickel level differences in the upper range were tested.",
            "Urinary nickel levels were significantly higher in workers employed in the Nikel nickel smelter (median 5.6 pg/i), compared to the nonoc- cupationally exposed population in Nikel (median 3.4 pg/I) (Table 3).",
            "Similarly, workers in the ore-roasting plant in Zapolyarny had increased urinary nickel content compared to nonexposed people in that city (medians 4.6 pg/i vs. 2.1 pg/i, respectively) (Table 3).",
            "In workers dealing with ore milling, concentration, and flota- tion in the ore beneficiation plant in Zapolyarny, the median concentration was not increased (2.4 pg/i), but the high mean value (6.2 pg/i) and the significant X2 test indicated some considerably higher single values among these workers (Table 3).",
            "Work with maintenance and services did not increase the urinary concentrations either in Nikel or Zapolyarny (medians 3.2 pg/i and 1.6 pg/i, respectively).",
            "Exposure from tobacco smoke.",
            "Smokers and nonsmokers were compared separately for each place with the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and no statistically significant differ- ences were found.",
            "Nickel in tap water.",
            "Tap water analysis showed large differences in nickel levels between the different study areas (Fig. 5).",
            "Nikel had significantly raised nickel content in tap water compared with the other areas (median 68 pg/i), followed by Zapolyarny (median 34 pg/I).",
            "Apatity (median 5.6 pg/i) had intermediate levels, and the lowest nickel concentrations were encountered in Troms0, S0r-Varanger, and Umba (medians 0.2, 1.0, and 0.8 pg/i, respectively).",
            "Discussion",
            "We found large differences in urinary nick- el concentrations between the Norwegian and Russian populations; however, withincountry differences were less pronounced.",
            "Except for the population of Nikel, vicinity to a Russian nickel refinery could not explain the observed contents of nickel in urine in either country.",
            "The Norwegian comparison group (Troms0) had higher levels than people of S0r-Varanger, and the Russian comparison groups (Apatity and Umba) did not have lower nickel excretion than the residents of Zapolyarny.",
            "Strengths and limitations of the study.",
            "The population-based study design and the  large number of people examined allows us to draw condusions about nickel levels in the general populations that we have stud- ied.",
            "Our data may be subject to selection bias due to the relatively low participation rate, especially on the Russian side.",
            "In Russia, fewer men than women participat- ed, which might point toward an under- representation of certain occupational groups at the nickel refineries in Nikel and Zapolyarny.",
            "However, the method used to recruit people to the study in Russia was not likely to have influenced the results because there is no reason to suspect signif- icant differences in exposure status by resi- dence location within each city.",
            "In S0r- Varanger, the settlements in the border area were overrepresented as a result of the way urine specimens were selected for analysis.",
            "Thus, the results do not reflect the true population average.",
            "Subanalyses from S0r-Varanger showed that the rural areas dosest to the border had lower nickel levels than the urban area of Kirkenes (9).",
            "For our purposes, however, this heterogeneity was not of importance because the differ- ence across the border was of a much greater magnitude.",
            "Some nickel contamination from clothes and skin during specimen collec- tion cannot be ruled out, and although identical instructions were given to all par- ticipants, differential contributions from this source may have occurred as a result of different nickel contents in ambient air.",
            "Differential nickel contamination from storage and analysis of urine, however, is not likely to have occurred because the same kind of plastic containers were used for sample collection and storage, and one laboratory was responsible for all nickel measurements.",
            "Another possible source of bias is the influence of urine-dilution effects on nickel concentration when spot samples are taken.",
            "Different methods for dilution adjustments exist, the most common being normaliza- tion by specific gravity or by urinary creati- nine ( 16).",
            "In our study we measured urinary creatinine concentrations to allow dilution adjustments.",
            "However, such nor- malization introduces new bias to the results because the elimination of creatinine is dependent on factors such as age, sex, muscular mass, pregnancy, exercise, diet, and various diseases (17).",
            "Moreover, normalization based on urinary creatinine may overestimate nickel concentrations in dilute urine specimens; Sunderman et al.   (18) recommended that for random urine specimens, creatinine-adjusted nickel con- centrations should only be reported as a supplement to unadjusted nickel values.",
            "We found it appropriate to present both sets of values to demonstrate that, like the unadjusted nickel values, the adjusted val- ues did not correlate well with the industrial pollution levels (Fig. 3).",
            "The age trend that we observed in S0r- Varanger, Troms0, and Nikel might well be explained by age-dependent physiologic changes in the kidney rather than differ- ences in nickel exposure since the glomeru- lar filtration rate is known to decrease sig- nificantly with age (19).",
            "This assumption was supported by two facts: 1) because there were fewer individuals currently employed in the nickel industry among those aged 18-29 years than among those aged 30-49 years, occupational exposure was unlikely to explain the age trend; and 2) no significant age trend appeared in either study population after adjustments were made for urinary creatinine.",
            "Industrial pollution in the study areas.",
            "The Geologic Survey of Norway (NGU) has estimated annual nickel deposition in three catchments in the Kola Peninsula, namely, in the vicinity of Zapolyarny, Monchegorsk, and Kirovsk; one catchment in S0r-Varanger 35 km southwest (off- wind) of the smelter in Nikel was also sur- veyed (20).",
            "The estimates were based on nickel concentrations in samples of rainwa- ter and meltwater during the year 1993-1994.",
            "The annual deposition was estimated to be 5.3 g/m2 in the Norwegian catchment, 434 g/m2 in Zapolyarny, 845 g/m2 in Monchegorsk, and 4.7 g/m2 in Kirovsk.",
            "Apatity is situated dose to Kirovsk.",
            "It is evident from these numbers that the Umba Kirovsk deposition is considerably lower than in Zapolyarny, dosely resembling the deposition in the Norwegian catchment.",
            "According to a map of nickel concentra- tions from the same NGU Kola project, the mean annual deposition in Umba was approximately 1 g/m2 (21).",
            "In summary, industrial nickel emissions are high in Zapolyarny and Monchegorsk due to the local nickel refineries; the same is implied for Nikel.",
            "The deposition of nickel is far less pronounced in Apatity and S0r-Varanger and even lower in Umba.",
            "This pollution pattern appears to be roughly reflected in our tap water samples (Fig. 5).",
            "Evaluation of nickel exposure sources.",
            "Our objective was to assess the impact of the nickel refineries near the Norwegian-Russian border as a human nickel exposure source.",
            "On the Norwegian side, the finding of high- er nickel concentrations in Troms0 than in S0r-Varanger virtually rules out the industry as an important source.",
            "On the Russian side, the industrial exposure is likely to account for a part of the high urinary nickel levels encountered in Nikel because both the uri- nary and the tap water nickel are significantly higher in that city.",
            "The distribution among the other setdements is, however, more diffi- cult to explain.",
            "Although there were few specimens from Umba, they dearly indicate that nickel concentrations were high in the Russian populations, regardless of location in relation to nickel industrial sites.",
            "The Russian study groups all had increased uri- nary nickel compared to those in Norway, and it seems reasonable to search for a nonindustrial country factor to explain this national difference.",
            "When evaluating exposure sources, the different bioavailability of the specific nickel compounds must be considered (22).",
            "In the occupational context, it has been shown that exposure to soluble nickel com- pounds yields urinary nickel concentrations that are generally proportional to levels in ambient air.",
            "For the relatively insoluble nickel compounds, the air-urine relation- ship is less strong (8,16,23).",
            "Unfortunately, no chemical speciation of nickel compounds in the Nikel and Zapolyarny emis- sions has been undertaken.",
            "Recent studies of occupational exposure in the nickel refineries at Monchegorsk concluded that relatively insoluble nickel oxides and sul- fides are dominant species (24).",
            "However, the specific departments surveyed featured secondary nickel refining, but in Nikel and Zapolyarny, primary refining is undertaken with nickel matte as the end product.",
            "Nevertheless, it is likely that nickel sulfate, nickel oxides, and nickel sulfides, in combi- nation with non-nickel particles, are represented in the smelter emissions at Nikel and Zapolyarny, although their relative proportions cannot be predicted.",
            "During the winter of 1994/1995, the mean PMIO (particulate matter <10 pm in aerodynamic diameter) levels of nickel in ambient air at two Norwegian monitoring stations located close to the border were 22.5 ng/m3 and 10 ng/m3, whereas in Nikel the level was 53.5 ng/m3 (25).",
            "The levels recorded at these stations did not show consistent seasonal variations during the years 1990-1995 (25).",
            "Occupational, environ- mental, and biological monitoring studies suggest that the slope value for plots of uri- nary nickel versus ambient nickel have values around 0.10 (pgll)l(pg/m3) for relatively water-insoluble nickel compounds and 1.0 (pg/l)/(jig/m3) for water-soluble compounds (16,22,24,26).",
            "Consequently, ambient nick- el concentrations of the order of <1 jg/m3 might be expected to make only a minor contribution to urinary nickel levels.",
            "Indirect contributions through ingestion of dust and tap water are likely to constitute more meaningful environmental nickel sources, at least for residents of Nikel.",
            "In searching for a country factor that could explain the different nickel levels in Norway and Russia, we have considered various possible nickel sources that may be differently distributed in the two countries.",
            "Drinking water and foodstuffs are both important exposure sources for nickel (3), although nickel in water is absorbed to a greater extent than nickel in food (27).",
            "Despite water being a good index for industrial pollution in our study, the observed drinking water concentrations could not explain the urinary concentrations.",
            "An exception to this was Nikel, where both tap water and urinary nickel concentrations were high.",
            "We also measured nickel in tap water boiled in private Russian homes with private cooking utensils.",
            "The nickel distribution between the study areas was the same as for the unboiled water (unpublished data); hence, nickel released from cooking utensils was not important.",
            "No association was found between consumption of locally produced food (i.e., domestic animals, game, berries, and fish) and urinary nickel levels in S0r-Varanger (9); in Russia, this information was not requested.",
            "Most of the food consumed on both sides of the border is, however, imported from elsewhere.",
            "Trade of food across the border has been very limited.",
            "We do not have sufficient information about dietary habits in either study population.",
            "This is unfortunate because it may well explain some of the national differences in urinary nickel excre- tion.",
            "In addition, the way food is preserved may also play a role.",
            "We have already suggested an effect of urbanization and traffic on urinary nickel concentrations in S0r-Varanger (91.",
            "In the Russian cities in out study, all participants were urban dwellers; thus, on the Russian side, the possible effect of urbanization could not be properly studied.",
            "Urban resi- dency may account for some of the nation- al differences, given the fact that the Russian cities have larger population densi- ty than the city of Troms0.",
            "Interestingly, the difference between Troms0 levels and Russian levels was reduced somewhat after the urinary nickel concentrations were adjusted for creatinine (Fig. 3).",
            "Tobacco smoking has been regarded by some authors as an important source of human nickel exposure (28,29) although the amount of nickel in mainstream smoke has been a topic of some controversy (30).",
            "The association between nickel in urine and smok- ing habits in S0r-Varanger has been studied (9), and no significant relationship was revealed.",
            "Analyses from Nikel, Zapolyarny, and Apatity yielded negative results as well, and we question the significance of tobacco smoke as a source of nickel uptake.",
            "In the search for exposure sources that might explain the discrepancy between Norway and Russia, we propose that dental implants may play a role.",
            "Most Russian dental implants are made from nickel-con- taining metal alloys (31), and corrosion with subsequent leakage of nickel to the saliva is possible (32).",
            "In several studies, leakage from stainless steel surgical implants (i.e., hip prostheses) caused increased serum and urinary nickel levels in individuals (33-35) although a study by Sunderman et al. ( 36) did not confirm this.",
            "It was evident from these studies that the degree of nickel leakage depended on the quality of the stainless steel.",
            "Occupational exposure.",
            "As expected, occupational nickel exposure increased uri- nary nickel excretion in current workers.",
            "Because these workers constituted only a small fraction of the population, this did not seem to influence the results of the general population in Nikel and Zapolyarny.",
            "Considerably higher urinary levels have been reported in occupationally exposed workers from other nickel refineries, such as the Falconbridge nickel reflnery in Kristiansand, Norway (13,14), and more recently at the refinery at Monchegorsk (24).",
            "Several factors may account for the difference observed: 1) different chemical species of nickel; 2) different stages in the refining process-workers employed in sec- ondary refining are known to experience higher exposures; and 3) possible dilution of existing differences between exposed and nonexposed individuals in our study because of misclassification of the workers occupationally exposed to nickel.",
            "Former studies of nonoccupationally exposed subjects.",
            "No other study has, to our knowledge, included a comparably high number of urine specimens for nickel mea- surements.",
            "According to the TRACY-pro- ject, an international project for identifying reference intervals for concentrations of trace elements in human blood and urine (37), the largest study conducted so far was Italian and included 878 adults (38).",
            "Six   b95th percentile.",
            "studies aiming to provide reference values on urinary nickel were referred in the TRACY protocol (Table 4).",
            "The S0r-Varanger nickel levels were, in general, lower than the proposed reference values, and the Russian levels exceeded them.",
            "To date, few studies have focused on urinary nickel con- centrations in environmentally exposed pop- ulations.",
            "A study by Hopfer et al. (39), from the Canadian nickel refining town of Sudbury, focused on the effects of environ- mental pollution on urinary nickel excre- tion.",
            "In spot urine samples from 22 healthy hospital workers, the adjusted nickel levels averaged 2.4 \u00b1 2.1 pg/g creatinine, whereas the mean \u00b1 SD for a control group of 43 hospital workers in Hartford, Connecticut, was 1.5 \u00b1 1.5 pg/g creatinine.",
            "This slight difference, which was not statistically significant, contrasted sharply with the great dif- ference found in tap water samples from Sudbury and Hartford; 109 \u00b1 46 pg/l and 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 pg/l, respectively.",
            "It was evident that nickel from the local tap water did not add much to the urinary nickel levels in Sudbury.",
            "In our study, tap water levels seemed to be dosely related to air pollution levels.",
            "Although Russian urinary nickel lev- els were high regardless of nickel content in drinking water, in Nikel, tap water levels seemed to reflect an environmental effect superimposed on the country factor, since both tap water and urinary levels were higher in this city.",
            "Odland et al. (40) studied urinary nick- el concentrations, as well as levels of several other metals, in pregnant women and new- borns living Nikel and S0r-Varanger in 1991-1994.",
            "Controls were taken from the cities of Arkhangelsk, Russia, and Bergen, Norway.",
            "Their results were consistent with ours; the Russian urine samples had much nickel higher contents than the Norwegian samples, while the within-country differ- ences were less pronounced.",
            "Assessment of health effects.",
            "An excess risk of respiratory cancer has been shown for employees in the nickel refining indus- try (16,41).",
            "In nickel-exposed workers, however, most studies have demonstrated urinary nickel levels considerably higher than those we observed in our study populations (13)(14)(15)).",
            "An increased cancer risk is very unlikely on both sides of the Norwegian-Russian border at the recorded environmental exposure levels.",
            "Actually, cancer incidence was studied in the Norwegian settlements dosest to the border (Fig. 2), based on data from the Norwegian Cancer Registry from 1970 to 1989 (42,43).",
            "No conclusions could be made about any increased cancer risk.",
            "In Russia, no sufficiently updated cancer registry exists; thus, cancer incidence is difficult tO study.",
            "Nickel allergy, which is another important clinical effect of nickel (44), was also evaluated in the present project and will be reported in a separate publication.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Urinary nickel levels in our Norwegian and Russian study populations were poorly associated with the proximity of residence to the Russian nickel refining industry.",
            "Regardless of location, the Russian populations all had significantly higher urinary nickel concen- trations than the Norwegian groups, indi- cating that unidentified nonindustrial expo- sures are of importance.",
            "Although the popu- lations living in the border area are very dose geographically, they have been almost totally isolated from one another until the recent collapse of the Soviet Union.",
            "The existing differences in lifestyle, dietary habits, and socioeconomic conditions should be studied when searching for expo- sure sources that may explain the different nickel levels in these two countries.",

            "PM2.5 and PM10 were as high as 200 and 400 \u03bcg/m3, respectively, in some segments of the path.",
            "After adjusting for other factors, the factors that had the largest effects on local PM pollution were nearby wood and charcoal stoves, congested and heavy traffic, loose dirt road surface, and trash burning.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Biomass fuels, transportation, and unpaved roads may be important determinants of local PM variation in Accra neighborhoods.",
            "If confirmed by additional or supporting data, the results demonstrate the need for effective and equitable interventions and policies that reduce the impacts of traffic and biomass pollution.",
            "Urban air pollution is responsible for an estimated 800,000 annual deaths worldwide.",
            "The burden of disease from air pollution exposure is borne disproportionately by the growing urban populations in the developing world, where pollution is substantially higher than in high-income countries.",
            "Research in cities in the United States and Europe has demonstrated substantial spatial variation in air pollution between and within neighborhoods, in relation primarily to specific sources as well as to neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES).",
            "Sources of air pollution in developing country cities include those that are common in high-income nations (e.g., transportation and industrial pollution), as well as biomass and coal fuel use for household and commercial purposes and resuspended dust from unpaved roads.",
            "A few studies have examined spatial variability and sources of air pollution in cities in developing countries, but few have been in low-income \u201cslum\u201d neighborhoods, have systematically examined variation in air pollution within neighborhoods, or have analyzed the effects of sources on local pollution levels.",
            "The absence of data on air pollution in urban communities in the developing world, especially from slums, occurs despite the evidence that other environmental factors, such as sanitation infrastructure, are worse in slum areas.",
            "In the present study we systematically collected and analyzed data on particulate matter (PM) in four neighborhoods in Accra, Ghana, with emphasis on within-neighborhood variability of PM pollution in relation to nearby sources.",
            "Accra is a major city in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest urban population growth rate in the world.",
            "Materials and Methods",
            "Study location",
            "Accra is the capital city of Ghana and is located on the Gulf of Guinea, with an elevation of 0\u201360 m above sea level.",
            "The population of the Accra metropolitan area (AMA) increased from 600,000 in 1970 to 1 million in 1984 and 1.7 million in 2000.",
            "Our study took place in four Accra neighborhoods: Jamestown/Ushertown (JT), Asylum Down (AD), Nima (NM), and East Legon (EL) (Figure 1).",
            "Study neighborhoods were selected such that they lie on a nearly straight line from the coast to the northern boundaries of the AMA, and they had varying SES based on data from the 2000 Population and Housing Census of Ghana.",
            "JT is an old inner-core area that lies between the coast and the Accra business center; AD and NM are located approximately 3 km inland, separated from one another by the Ring Road Central; EL is 10 km inland and lies just north of Kotoka International Airport in Accra.",
            "JT and NM are poor, densely populated communities where many residents live in shared compounds along narrow alleys.",
            "Biomass is the predominant fuel used for household cooking and is also used for small-scale commercial purposes, such as the smoking of fish over wood fires (JT) and cooking of food by street vendors (JT and NM).",
            "Both JT and NM have markets and many small vendors that sustain activities throughout the day.",
            "A large, busy road with a central bus station runs through NM.",
            "AD is a middle-class neighborhood, with a combination of residential and commercial buildings.",
            "It is bordered by the Ring Road Central, one of the largest and busiest roads in Accra.",
            "Street food vendors are less common in AD than in JT and NM.",
            "EL is an upper-class, sparsely populated, residential neighborhood with most families living in modern homes on large plots of land.",
            "The streets are quiet during the day.",
            "The main road in EL has heavier traffic primarily during the morning and evening commute periods.",
            "According to data from the Ghana 2000 Population and Housing Census (unpublished data), 81% of households in JT, 75% in NM, 49% in AD, and 46% in EL use charcoal and/or wood as their primary cooking fuel.",
            "Study design",
            "A study of spatial and temporal variability of air pollution would ideally be based on continuous data using a dense network of monitors placed at multiple locations, with additional information on sources and meteorologic factors gathered at each location.",
            "For PM, which is generally considered the best indicator of the health effects of urban air pollution, such an approach would be prohibitively costly and logistically difficult using current technologies, especially when continuous (vs. temporally integrated/averaged) data are needed.",
            "We used a combination of mobile and stationary monitors to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of air pollution and the effects of sources in these neighborhoods.",
            "We conducted consecutive days of mobile monitoring in each neighborhood (7 days in most neighborhoods) (Table 1).",
            "There were two monitoring tours on each day, unless it rained for more than approximately 30 min or there was an equipment failure, in which case the tour was postponed or cancelled.",
            "In each monitoring tour, we walked slowly along a predetermined path recording data at 1-min intervals with a continuous real-time PM monitor and a global positioning system (GPS) unit.",
            "The path for each neighborhood was designed to traverse different areas, including main highways/roads, local roads, residential alleys and foot paths, and markets.",
            "The paths ranged 7.7\u20139.4 km in length, and the tours lasted 4.5\u20135.5 hr in duration in different neighborhoods (Figure 1).",
            "Each path included approximately 20 predetermined 5-min stops, including one stop at ground level in front of most fixed-monitoring sites (Figure 1).",
            "At each stop, information on PM sources within 10\u201315 m was recorded through a visual sighting of the source or presence of smoke using a standardized form programmed into Palm Z22 handheld units (Palm, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).",
            "The information included nearby biomass stoves (including fuel type and number of stoves), traffic flow, other combustion sources (e.g., trash burning), and road surface.",
            "We also measured 48-hr integrated concentrations of PM with aerodynamic diameters \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) and \u2264 10 \u03bcm (PM10) at three roof-top fixed-monitoring sites in each neighborhood [two in NM because an earlier pilot study found nearly identical concentrations at two of the original three sites ].",
            "One fixed-monitoring site in each neighborhood was located along a main road, and the others were located in residential areas (> 100 m from main roads, although some were along smaller roads).",
            "The monitors were 4\u20137 m above ground level so that the air was relatively well mixed and less likely to be strongly affected by a source in the immediate vicinity.",
            "We also measured PM2.5 and PM10 continuously at as many fixed-monitoring sites as possible.",
            "Analysis of between-neighborhood variation using data from the fixed-monitoring sites are presented elsewhere.",
            "Measurements were done in April 2007 (before the main rainy season) in AD and in July\u2013August 2007 (after the main rainy season) in the other neighborhoods.",
            "There were no unusual meteorologic factors during the measurement periods.",
            "PM measurement methods",
            "We used DustTrak model 8520 monitors (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA) for continuous measurement of PM2.5 and PM10.",
            "DustTrak has an internal laser photometer that uses a 90\u00b0 light-scattering laser diode to measure PM concentration in air drawn by an internal pump.",
            "DustTrak monitors were operated at 1.7 L/min and used TSI-supplied inlet nozzles with a cutoff of 10 \u03bcm (aerodynamic diameter) for PM10 measurement; for PM2.5 measurement, DustTrak monitors were fitted with an external size-selective inlet containing a level greased impaction surface and with a cutoff of 2.5 \u03bcm (aerodynamic diameter) and were operated at 0.8 L/min.",
            "The DustTrak measures PM concentrations every second and was set to average these measurements and record at 1-min intervals.",
            "The DustTrak monitors were set to zero against a zero filter on each measurement day.",
            "The factory-specified resolution of the DustTrak monitor is \u00b1 0.1% of reading or \u00b1 1 \u03bcg/m3, whichever is greater.",
            "PM measured using light-scattering technologies is subject to error because DustTrak photometers are calibrated to aerosols whose characteristics (e.g., shape, size, density, and refractive index) may differ from those in our study and because measured concentration may be affected by factors such as humidity.",
            "For the same reasons, measurement errors can vary across days or neighborhoods.",
            "To adjust for DustTrak measurement error, we corrected continuous (DustTrak) PM concentrations by a correction factor (CF) calculated using the gravimetric data as described below.",
            "PM concentration measured gravimetrically has substantially less measurement error but, by definition, measures the average concentration for the whole measurement period.",
            "Gravimetric PM measurements are described in detail elsewhere.",
            "In summary, gravimetric PM samples were collected on a PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) filter with ring (Teflo, 0.2 \u03bcm pore size, 37 mm diameter; Pall Life Sciences, Port Washington, NY, USA), back-supported by a Whatman drain disc (Whatman Inc., Piscataway, NJ).",
            "PM10 measurements used a Harvard impactor with a D50 (50% collection efficiency) of 10 \u03bcm (aerodynamic diameter) at 4 L/min (\u00b1 10%), with two consecutive pre-oiled impactor plates serving as the impaction surface.",
            "PM2.5 measurements used a modified Harvard impactor combined with a polyurethane foam (PUF) PM2.5 size-selective inlet, with a D50 of 2.5 \u03bcm at 5 L/min (\u00b110%), with a PUF pad serving as the impaction surface.",
            "All PM concentrations were blank corrected.",
            "The CF was calculated separately for PM2.5 and PM10 and for each 48-hr measurement period.",
            "At each fixed-monitoring site we used the gravimetric-to-DustTrak ratio as the CF for the site itself.",
            "The CF for DustTrak monitors used in mobile monitoring was calculated as the geometric mean of the CFs of the corresponding size fraction for all the fixed-monitoring sites in that neighborhood on the measurement day.",
            "The mean and 5th and 95th percentiles of the individual fixed-site CFs were 0.75, 0.35, and 1.19, respectively; those of the mobile monitor CFs were 0.78, 0.48, and 1.25, respectively.",
            "Because of interruptions of either the gravimetric or the photometer measurements in JT, we had only a single CF for this neighborhood.",
            "We conducted the following sensitivity analyses to ensure that the missing CFs did not affect our overall conclusions: applying CFs calculated from the sites in NM, where measurements took place on the same days; and repeating all analyses with uncorrected JT fixed-site and mobile-monitor data, as has been done in at least one previous study without gravimetric data.",
            "The results from these two analyses were within the 95% confidence interval (CI) of each other, indicating that the conclusions are robust.",
            "Meteorologic/weather variables",
            "PM concentration depends on meteorologic/weather variables such as humidity, wind speed, and recent rain.",
            "For this reason, we adjusted the estimated effects of nearby sources on local PM for these variables.",
            "Data on relative humidity (RH), wind speed, and time since last rain were from a station near the Kotoka International Airport and maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/stationlocator.html).",
            "We predicted RH and wind speed for hours with missing data using simple linear models when data were missing for < 3 hr.",
            "When > 3 hr of data were missing, we used the average of RH for the same hour during 5 days before and 5 days after the missing value.",
            "We then fit a cubic spline function to hourly RH and wind speed to obtain RH values for each minute.",
            "RH and wind speed on days that we conducted mobile monitoring were on average 79% (interquartile range, 72\u201386%) and 11 miles/hr (interquartile range, 8\u201314 miles/hr).",
            "Data management",
            "Using the time stamps of DustTrak monitors, we compiled error-corrected continuous PM2.5 and PM10 data from fixed sites and mobile monitors into a single data set, with each record representing a unique date, minute, and location.",
            "Geographic coordinates for each mobile monitor data point were also included using the GPS date/time stamp.",
            "Because GPS units measure true location with error, GPS coordinates were \u201csnapped\u201d to the nearest point on the monitoring path; the location of the path was ascertained using a Trimble GeoXT GPS unit (Trimble Navigation Limited, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with a nominal error of < 1 m.",
            "When a point was at or near the intersection of two roads that were both on the path, the snapping retained the temporal ordering of data points.",
            "The average change in the position of points snapped to the path was about 3 m.",
            "Weather variables were also added using date and time stamps.",
            "We merged DustTrak and Palm date and time stamps and GPS geographic coordinates to identify the measurements taken at each stop along the monitoring path.",
            "Measurements were averaged over the approximately 5 min of recordings for each stop visit and then merged with the PM source data collected on the Palm units.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "We provide graphical presentation as well as descriptive statistics for mobile PM measurements.",
            "We also analyzed the stop data, which included simultaneous data on PM and sources at the same location, for the effects of specific pollution sources and meteorologic factors.",
            "All analyses used PM data corrected for DustTrak measurement error as described above.",
            "We used regression analysis to quantify the effects of sources on PM concentrations at stops.",
            "Because the mobile monitors reached stops at different times, the PM data from mobile monitors alone cannot determine if observed variations across stops are due to sources or due to changes in the overall neighborhood PM level, which happened to be lower or higher when the monitor reached a specific stop.",
            "For example, if woodstoves were disproportionately present at stops visited early in the day in a specific neighborhood, and if other factors (e.g., heavy traffic) led to high PM concentration at those times in that neighborhood, the effects of woodstoves on PM might be overestimated.",
            "To deal with this issue, we adjusted the local PM-source regressions for the average neighborhood PM concentration at the same time; average neighborhood concentration was estimated as the average of those at all fixed-monitoring sites (which, by being fixed, vary only in time).",
            "This approach may, however, lead to an underestimation of the effects of sources if the neighborhood average itself was influenced by that source and others like it.",
            "For example, if the high neighborhood PM concentrations in early mornings resulted from the use of woodstoves, which happened to be present at stops visited at those hours, adjusting for neighborhood average could underestimate the role of woodstoves.",
            "Therefore, we present our regression results both with and without adjustment for the neighborhood average.",
            "We estimated the following regression equation:",
            "where X is a vector of source variables (data collected using Palm units); Weather is a vector of weather variables; \u03b2, \u03b4, and \u03ba are regression coefficients; and \u025b is an error term.",
            "We used a linear mixed effects model with a random group effect for each neighborhood-day.",
            "Neighborhood-day group effect helps remove the influence of unobserved factors that affect all measurements in each neighborhood on the measurement day, for example, unmeasured weather pattern or phenomena that lead to more or less combustion.",
            "PM concentrations were log-transformed to ensure that model residuals were normally distributed.",
            "The five measurements at each stop were averaged because source data were recorded once for the 5-min duration of the stop, and because averaging reduces random error due to short-term fluctuations in PM.",
            "We also smoothed the fixed-site continuous PM data to retain salient temporal patterns and remove minute-to-minute stochastic noise, which is likely to be highly local.",
            "We used a nonparametric regression [locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) regression] for smoothing, with a 60-min bounding radius, which tends to eliminate perturbations sustained for < 10 min but maintain patterns lasting more than 30 min.",
            "All analyses were done separately for PM2.5 and PM10 using the open-source statistical analysis package R, version 2.6.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",
            "Results",
            "Figure 2 shows the gravimetric-corrected concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 along the walking path, averaged over all monitoring days/tours.",
            "In our measurement campaign, the EL walking path had the lowest levels of PM and the JT walking path the highest, with geometric means of PM2.5 and PM10 of 21 and 49 \u03bcg/m3, respectively, along the EL path and 39 and 96 \u03bcg/m3, respectively, along the JT path.",
            "In fact, the less polluted segments of the JT walking path had PM2.5 and PM10 values that were similar to the average for all of EL.",
            "AD and NM walking paths had PM pollution levels that fell between the other two neighborhoods, with geometric means of PM2.5 and PM10 of 35 and 86 \u03bcg/m3 for AD and 41 and 58 \u03bcg/m3 for NM.",
            "In AD and NM, pollution was highest along the largest roads/highways.",
            "Our observations during data collection indicate that the primary pollution source along the main highway in AD was traffic (cars, minibuses, and trucks) and in NM a combination of traffic and roadside biomass use.",
            "Figure 3 shows the crude associations of nearby sources with residual PM, defined as the difference between PM measured during 5-min stops and the neighborhood average in the same 5 min.",
            "PM2.5 and PM10 measurements at stops with multiple woodstoves were, respectively, 30 \u03bcg/m3 and 85 \u03bcg/m3 higher than the neighborhood average at the same time (median residual); the residual PM2.5 and PM10 were smaller for stops that had one woodstove (8 \u03bcg/m3 and 32 \u03bcg/m3) or one or more charcoal stoves.",
            "When a stop had no stoves, residual PM2.5 and PM10 were only 0 \u03bcg/m3 and 14 \u03bcg/m3.",
            "Similarly, we generally found a gradient of residual PM pollution with increasing local traffic density.",
            "Residual PM2.5 and PM10 at stops near congested traffic were, respectively, 12 and 46 \u03bcg/m3 greater than the same metric for stops near light traffic (< 2 cars/min).",
            "However, residual PM2.5 (but not PM10) at stops with no traffic was higher than at stops with light and medium traffic (see below).",
            "The results in Figure 3 show only crude associations; that is, they do not consider the possibility that some sources may be more/less likely to co-occur at the same place.",
            "For example, it may be the case that stops with no traffic had higher PM2.5 because charcoal or wood stoves were present near them.",
            "Table 2 shows the adjusted association of PM with sources and demonstrates a number of features of local PM pollution in these neighborhoods.",
            "First, adjusting for average neighborhood pollution had some, but limited, influence on either the magnitude of the effects of individual sources or their statistical significance.",
            "Second, the presence of multiple woodstoves (Figure 4) had the unequivocal largest effect on nearby PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations.",
            "In the log-transformed model, multiple nearby woodstoves would be associated with nearly three times (297%; 95% CI, 247\u2013357%) higher PM2.5 levels and more than two times (227%; 95% CI, 189\u2013272%) higher PM10 levels after adjustment for all other source and meteorologic variables (262% and 197% higher if neighborhood averages were also adjusted for).",
            "The next most important determinants of local pollution were the presence of a single woodstove or multiple charcoal stoves, heavy/congested traffic, having loose dirt road surface, and trash burning (Figure 4).",
            "The coefficients of trash burning were significant only for PM2.5, possibly because this source was present at fewer stops than were other combustion sources.",
            "The coefficients of nearby stoves were ordered with larger effects from woodstoves than from charcoal stoves and larger effects from multiple stoves than from single ones.",
            "Further, for each stove category, the coefficients of the log-transformed regression were larger for PM2.",
            "5 than for PM10, that is, larger proportional effects on PM2.5.",
            "The coefficients of nearby traffic flow also rose monotonically with apparently comparable proportional effects on PM2.5 and PM10.",
            "Stops where road surface was loose dirt had significantly higher PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, and those with broken paved surface had higher PM10 concentrations after adjustment for combustion sources; PM did not seem to vary with other road surface materials.",
            "The slightly larger proportional effects of loose dirt road surface on PM2.5 compared with PM10 is unexplained and may be attributable to the presence of unrecorded sources (e.g., stoves inside homes that were not visible to us).",
            "After controlling for traffic and other local sources at stops, the coefficient of distance from the main road was nonsignificant in most models.",
            "Discussion",
            "This study provides one of the first systematic measurements showing how PM pollution varies within neighborhoods of varying SES in a developing country city and the role of specific combustion sources in local pollution patterns.",
            "Our results showed significant spatial variability in PM concentrations within a small geographic area in these neighborhoods (each ~ 1\u20132 km diameter).",
            "In our measurement campaign, the walking path in the lower SES neighborhood of JT had the highest pollution, followed by segments of the path along the primary road in NM and the Ring Road Central in AD.",
            "PM2.5 and PM10 were as high as 200 and 400 \u03bcg/m3, respectively, in some segments of the path.",
            "Combinations of stationary and mobile measurements have been used to investigate variations in air pollution levels in relation to important sources in high-income countries.",
            "Our study is an innovative application of such a design by conducting measurements in a developing country city, choosing multiple neighborhoods with varied SES, and assessing the role of sources.",
            "Prior studies of local PM pollution have used different metrics (e.g., particle count vs. particle mass; fine vs. ultrafine particle mass).",
            "Therefore, our results can be compared only with selected other studies that measured PM2.5 and PM10 in urban microenvironments.",
            "This comparison shows that during this campaign PM pollution along primary roads was comparable to or higher than the most polluted urban microenvironments, for example, in buses and trolleys and near bus stations, and substantially higher than those in wood burning areas of the Pacific Northwest or roadside sites in European cities.",
            "We could not locate other studies of small-area spatial variability and sources in developing country cities for direct comparison.",
            "More broadly, studies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Bolpur, India, found higher PM along major traffic routes than in nontraffic areas, but these studies did not examine the presence of nontransportation combustion sources; a study at multiple sites in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, also found spatial variation in short-term PM measurements but did not collect data on nearby sources.",
            "Our study has a number of innovations and strengths.",
            "We used a combination of georeferenced pollution and source data from mobile monitoring to investigate both the within-neighborhood spatial patterns of PM2.5 and PM10 pollution and the effects of nearby sources on local pollution.",
            "The data were from four neighborhoods that covered the full range of community SES in Accra.",
            "We used a combination of fixed-site and mobile-monitor continuous data to account for the background temporal pattern of air pollution that may confound the data from mobile monitors.",
            "Finally, we used integrated PM measurement to correct for the measurement error of continuous data measured with DustTrak monitors.",
            "The data used in this study also have a number of limitations.",
            "First, data were collected during about 1 week in each neighborhood.",
            "The measurements in three neighborhoods (JT, NM, and EL) were conducted within a few weeks, and in the fourth (AD) a few months prior.",
            "Although there were no unusual meteorologic factors during data collection, it would be ideal to have multiple measurement campaigns in each neighborhood, in different seasons.",
            "Because of lack of data from different seasons, our results should not be used to estimate the usual or average pollution in these neighborhoods.",
            "However, our analysis of the effects of sources on local PM are unlikely to be affected by macro-level PM changes because we adjusted for average neighborhood pollution from fixed sites and used a mixed-effects model with neighborhood-day group effect.",
            "Second, PM measured with DustTrak monitors is subject to error.",
            "Although we systematically applied a CF to PM data, the steps involved in calculating CFs introduce additional uncertainty.",
            "Third, using mobile monitoring alone did not allow us to separate temporal and spatial changes in pollution.",
            "We relied on continuous PM data at fixed sites to adjust for temporal changes in neighborhood PM.",
            "If low-cost and low-power PM monitors were available, it would be ideal to have a large number of stationary monitors in the neighborhood instead of mobile ones.",

            "We found that, after adjusting for other factors, the factors wood and charcoal stoves, congested and heavy traffic, and trash burning had large and significant effects on local PM pollution in these Accra neighborhoods.",
            "Biomass fuels are a source of energy for households and small commercial purposes in urban sub-Saharan Africa, especially in low-income and marginalized neighborhoods; older vehicles are also common in sub-Saharan African cities.",
            "If other studies in Accra and other developing country cities show that the effects of these common sources on local pollution observed in our measurement campaign are typical of their usual contributions, there is need to identify and implement effective and equitable transportation regulations and policies that reduce the impacts of traffic pollution, and technological and policy innovations that can reduce air pollution from biomass fuels without restricting what may be the only energy source available to poor households."
